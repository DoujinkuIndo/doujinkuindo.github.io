><strong>An algebraic approach to the Universal automaton</strong><br><i>With Prof. [Thomas Colcombet](https://www.irif.fr/~colcombe/), Prof. [Daniela Petrisan](https://www.irif.fr/~petrisan/)</i><br>
>>The notion Universal automaton has been studied since the last 50 years. Though complex and large it has many interesting properties and is worth a more careful look. Our goal is to study this automaton in an algebraic perspective.

<br> <i>Summer internship 2019 at IIT Goa under Prof. [Amaldev Manuel](https://www.iitgoa.ac.in/~amal)</i><br>
>> We propose a notion of variety for regular languages that are closed under the reverse operation. We observe that there is an Eilenberg-type correspondence between our proposed notion of varieties and pseudovarieties of hermitian semigroups --- semigroups with involutions that are generated by their hermitian elements. This relationship is further reinforced by lifting the notion of semidirect product of varieties of finite semigroups to the new setting in two ways. As an application it is shown that the class *Locally Reversible Threshold Testable*, those  languages that are definable in first-order logic with adjacency predicate, corresponds to the locally-hermitian block product of two varieties.
