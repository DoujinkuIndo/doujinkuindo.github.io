>> Systems modelled by Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often have a hard-(safety)-constraint that needs to be ensured. This constraint may be specified as a containment property for the state probability distribution vector in some [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope) (a closed convex space bounded by hyperplanes).
The escape problem for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), asks whether there is an adversarial strategy that takes the state probability vector outside the polytope. We study this problem with the goal of finding a decision procedure.
