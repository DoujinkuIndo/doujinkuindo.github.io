### Ongoing

><strong>An algebraic approach to the Universal automaton</strong><br><i>Summer internship 2020 at IRIF, Paris with Prof. [Thomas Colcombet](https://www.irif.fr/~colcombe/), Prof. [Daniela Petrisan](https://www.irif.fr/~petrisan/)</i><br>
>>The notion Universal automaton has been studied since the last 50 years. Though complex and large it has many interesting properties and is worth a more careful look. Our goal is to study this automaton in an algebraic perspective.
<br>

> <strong>Varieties of Reversible Regular languages</strong> [[draft](link here)].
<br> <i>Summer internship 2019 at IIT Goa under Prof. [Amaldev Manuel](https://www.iitgoa.ac.in/~amal)</i><br>
>> We propose a notion of variety for regular languages that are closed under the reverse operation. We first observe that there is an Eilenberg-type correspondence between our proposed notion of varieties and pseudovarieties of hermitian semigroups. As an application it is shown that the class *Locally Reversible Threshold Testable*, those  languages that are definable in first-order logic with adjacency predicate, corresponds to the locally-hermitian block product of the pseudovariety of aperiodic commutative involutory semigroups and the locally trivial pseudovariety of semigroups.

### Past

><strong>Commutative Algebra</strong><br><i>Summer internship 2018 with Prof. [R. Sridharan](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/fac-profile.php?id=rsridhar)</i><br>
>>This was a reading project in which I studied the fundamentals of Commutative algebra from classic texts by Zariski and Samuel as well as Nathan Jacobson on the subject.

<br>

### Course projects

><strong>Perturbed timed automata</strong><br>*Timed automata under Prof. [B Srivathsan](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~sri/)*<br>
>>Determinizability of one clock perturbed timed automata unlike non - perturbed. Gives a construction for the same extending to timed language inclusion decidability hence answering the problem of universality.

><strong>Invariant Model Checking by K-Induction</strong><br>*Model checking and software verification under Prof. [Mandayam Srivas](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~mksrivas/)*<br>
>>Implementation of invariant model checking algorithm by k-induction in z3.
