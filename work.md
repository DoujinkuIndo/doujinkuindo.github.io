# Pet Projects  
* **Advanced Machine Learning Project: Learning to Attend Relevant Regions in Videos from Eye Fixations** [(Demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HusCcKEoAdU) - *Thanh Nguyen* and *Dzung Nguyen*     
We train a LSTM in videos conditioned on eye fixations to predict attention regions in each frame.

Ranked 8th in [Lesion Segmentation](https://challenge.kitware.com/#phase/566744dccad3a56fac786787) and 1st in [Lesion Dermoscopic Feature Segmentation](https://challenge.kitware.com/#phase/56fc26f7cad3a54f8bb80e4c)   

* **Kaggle's competition: What's cooking (Kaggle, Dec. 2015)** [(Code)](https://github.com/thanh-ng/whats-cooking) - *Thanh Nguyen*  
![kaggel cooking](/images/Yummly_logo.png)  
This model predicts cuisines of a recipe based on the ingredients used in this recipe. Employing `tf-idf`, `chi-squared` feature selection and `svm` with `rbf`, the model ranks $61^{th}/1,388$ participants in the Kaggle Competition.
