    <h3>From architect to full-time web developer</h3>

    <p>
        Back in 2002 I went to college and studied architecture. During my career as an architect I worked in Amsterdam, Vienna and Frankfurt. I saw <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/244101/house-like-village-marc-koehler-architects/" target="_blank" alt="House like Village">some of my projects</a> built. It was fun!

        Yet recently I turned my former professional life down to become a full-time web developer.

        Nowadays I am still interested in building things, but this time by coding. I also feel inspired by contributing to the growing community of women in tech.
