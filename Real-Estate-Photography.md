> My camera in the sky can capture incredible images of properties. Allow these images to load, I uploaded the highest resolution I possibly could and may take time to load depending on your internet. Wi-fi reccomended on your phone if you do not have an unlimited data plan.

#### From above:

Photos from the sky can provide more context for a building and details about its surroundings. If you want aerial photos from any angle, I can produce these images. I can review the photos as I take them, and make sure I have exactly what I need by the end of the shoot. I have 3 batteries which last 30 minutes each (at best), and I would review footage between each battery. To shoot photos on your location requires an hour and a half to two hours of time.

#### From From any height:

I can get a clear shot of your property from any height, up to 400 feet above ground level. It can also take photos from near the ground, or even on the ground.

#### From From any angle:

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/sunnyside_2.jpg?raw=true" style="max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%"/>

I can get a clear shot of your property from any angle, or all angles.

#### in Panoramic mode:

I can capture both your property, and the view from your property in a single photo by using the Panoramic Mode on my drone. This holds the position of the drone while the drone takes a serious of photos from different angles and stiches them together.

> I am a carpenter, and these photos are from a ten minute flight session while I was on my lunch break. These photos are of the only real estate property where I've been given permission to fly and capture photos and keep them in my portfolio, so even though I only had 10 minues to fly I was still super greatful. Let me use all 3 batteries (90 minutes) on my drone at your location, and I can get excellent photos of your property!
