I only mentor high school students through the [Simons Summer Research Program (SSRP)](http://www.stonybrook.edu/simons/). Please refrain from contacting me directly before apply to SSRP, if you are interested in working in the lab.

Strong background in some areas of mathematics, statistics, machine learning, computational neuroscience, and/or numerical programming would be essential for your success.
If you have analyzed scientific time series data or have used machine learning techniques for science, it would improve your chances working with me.

My lab is a purely computational lab, meaning there would be no biological experiments.
The research experience almost certainly will involve programming (either for data analysis, computational modeling, or algorithm development).
