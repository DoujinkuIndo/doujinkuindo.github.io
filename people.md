The group is led by Dr. Natalie Gosnell and consists of Rory Lowe, Marta Nowatka, and Thom Ory. Marta is taking care of astrometry for this project, and Thom is assisted by Rory with the photometry. We post once a week as a group here and daily on our individual blogs to document our progress and findings.
