title: Referral Links

The following referral links are redirects (i.e. the link says it's this site, but it will take you to the provider's website):

{% assign pages = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.title contains ' Referral'" %} {% for page in pages %}
* [{{ page.title | remove : ' Referral' }}]({{ site.url }}{{page.url}}){% endfor %}
