  <p class="readable">First and foremost, I took this recipe from the wonderful, <a href="https://www.chefsteps.com/">ChefSteps</a>. If you've been meaning to up your cooking game or just get inspired by creativity in cuisine, I definitely recommend checking it out! I played with the idea of recipe cards for this one.. something that was portable and convenient.</p>

  <h1>Daily UI 038: Calendar</h1>

  <p class="readable">This calendar was created whilst I was trying to create a new calendar for my RIT MyCourses redesign. I figured the calendar was too colorful for an academic site so I played with the design a little more as Daily UI allows for any sort of creativity!</p>
