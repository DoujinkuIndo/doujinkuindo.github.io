## Please Read Important

Looking at <a href="http://timurcatakli.github.io/">my personal site</a>, you will notice that I used a Bootstrap Grid System. I understand that this is against the instructions. If this was to communicated in week-1 I wouldn't have done.

But here is my take on this:

My strong skills are HTML and CSS. Although I used bootstrap to cut some corners, in the mean time I didn't just lay down. Here is what I did with the time I saved by using Bootstrap:

1. Researched Jekyll.
2. Installed and configured Jekyll and most importantly I implemented on my homepage and the blog it is running.
3. I created custom fields for Jekyll (main post image etc) and implemented it on the page.
4. I also made changes to Bootstrap's CSS in order to fit my needs.
5. In the mean time I finished 3 books and here they are: Head First Ruby - The Well Grounded Rubyist (At Chapter 13) - Duckett HTML & CSS
6. I also wrote two small Ruby applications (lucky_numbers - ruby_state_tax_finder) which are available on my GitHub.
