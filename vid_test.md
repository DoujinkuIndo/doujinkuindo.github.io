### Some example footage of mine (lowered resolution)

<video src="https://github.com/murdockFPV/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/LUNCH-PEAK-LOOKOUT.mp4?raw=true" poster="https://github.com/murdockFPV/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/akulafpvlunchpeak.jpg?raw=true" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%" controls preload></video>

*Thanks for visiting my blog!* This specific page is me posting some drone footage like I might do for a client. You are welcome to view this as an example if you were to contact me for my services.

#### More information

* This type of thing is immensely helpful: Emails have file size limits, even sending a short preview can prove difficult. This uses web-hosting for the content and allows me to show you a preview of what has been captured. I can simply email you a link to a page like this.
* The full resolution files are huge at 4K/60FPS, I exported this video in such a way with lowered resolution so that **this video is only 17MB. I can capture a single .JPG image 30-40 MB with my drone**.
