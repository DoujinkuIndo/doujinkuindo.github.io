Classes from [OSS - Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)

I decided that I wanted a broader CS background than what I was going to get out of my minor, so I'm taking classes from here as I have time. Additionally, I want to stay fresh during my work semesters, so this seemed like good practice.
