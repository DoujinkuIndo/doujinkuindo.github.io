Ever hear of Klask? It’s a table-top game akin to air hockey that we play in the office at Esri. The goal is simple: hit the ball in the opponent’s goal using a piece **on** the table controlled by magnets **under** the table.

To keep a running list of everyone’s games won / lost, Justin Velgos and Joel Whitney designed and developed an iOS app. Aaron Pulver and I wanted to experiment with PWAs as a potentially viable alternative, instead of just creating an Android equivalent.

Klask is a fun, silly game that we don’t take too seriously. With that in mind, Justin and I had a little too much fun with the UI of the app. We decided to use a comical typeface, loosely related to the type etched onto the tabletop. We also went with a fun hulk-like color scheme for no good reason, just fun.
