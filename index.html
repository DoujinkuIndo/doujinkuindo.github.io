    This page contains reports that track how much time I spend on different
    projects to make it easier for me to shift my priorities from week to week.
    I track the time I spend on different tasks with
    <a href="https://clockify.me/tracker">clockify</a> and then pull that with
    their api, summarize my time spent in varying ways, and create a markdown
    file that reports on what I have worked on (all of which is done in R). I
    generate reports every other Monday.
