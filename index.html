  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    Hello and welcome to my website, I write about a bunch of topics including tech, gaming, society, and others.
    
    A little background on myself, I am an Engineer by trade currently working in the Machine Learning space, so I would probably write a lot about ML and tech,
    but I also love writing about video games, motorcycles, the economy, and other topics.

    A more detailed page about me is available on the site, feel free to mail your thoughts.

    Happy Reading!!
