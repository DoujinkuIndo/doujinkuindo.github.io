<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>The  original idea for creating this site/blog was to document some of the technical challenges I had faced while working on my personal 
    tech projects. Hopefully these articles will be useful for other developers who are facing similar issues, or who are 
    just interested in similar areas or approaches. One of the other objectives is to create some more personal and detailed content 
    for readers of my CV, who want to find out a bit more about my interests and ideas. In addition, I am hoping that this blog will be
    self-perpetuating, by encouraging me to explore more diverse areas of technology, and assess these more critically than I would
    have done previously - for example, the process of creating it has allowed me to discover a whole area of blogging and website-generation
    frameworks that I had never encountered before (see my inaugural <a href="https://julianjoseph.github.io/Hello-World/">Hello World</a>
    article).
