  <h3>Who am I?</h3>

  <p>
    I am a data-savvy person who finds joy in helping others understand the language of numbers.
    I have been working as a data analyst for a few years now.
    But I find the title "data analyst" as too narrow to cover all the things and tasks that I do.
    Therefore, I prefer to say that in my job **I am making data useful**.
    <br>
    I am a nerd. I am fascinated by, on the one hand, math and science,
    but on the other hand, human psychology and the various ways we interpret numbers.
  </p>

  <h3>What have I done so far?</h3>

  <p>
    When it comes to my work, I specialize in digital product analytics. I help product teams
    build better products by providing them insights, analyses and self-service data tools.
    I support teams in defining product metrics and then cooperate with software and data engineers
    in order to collect the right data to measure them.
    <br>
    In my free time I am learning new skills and broadening my knowledge.
