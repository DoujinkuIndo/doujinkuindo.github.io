### Who am I?

I am a data-savvy person who finds joy in helping others understand the language of numbers.
I have been working as a data analyst for a few years now.
But I find the title "data analyst" as too narrow to cover all the things and tasks that I do.
Therefore, I prefer to say that in my job **I am making data useful**.

I am a nerd. I am fascinated by, on the one hand, math and science,
but on the other hand, human psychology and the various ways we interpret numbers.

### What have I done so far?

When it comes to my work, I specialize in digital product analytics. I help product teams
build better products by providing them insights, analyses and self-service data tools.
I support teams in defining product metrics and then cooperate with software and data engineers
in order to collect the right data to measure them.

In my free time I am learning new skills and broadening my knowledge.
