title: What I Learned About Agile/SCRUM

A cpuple of days ago I took part in a course/seminar about agile and SCRUM as
an agile framework in particular and I wanted to write down some things I
learned in the process. These are things I was not quite aware of even though
I've been part of a couple of SCRUM projects.

I think the seminar gave me a different view on things, both internally for
the process and maybe even more important externally, about how people
percieve and understand SCRUM.

This is going to be an **attempt** to put down in words how I feel about
SCRUM and some of the key points that, again I feel, are maybe important for
its addoption. 

NOTE/WARNING: These are my own thoughts and they do not reflect any higher
ideas/opinions, nor are they intended to be taken as absolute or even near
close to the actual state of things.

So here goes:

# AGILE/SCRUM is all abound the mindset

It's about the way we think about things and software development in general.
Software, you can say, is about delivering some value. SCRUM fascilitates the
value delivery. And its probably about delivering the best value for the
client.

There was a lot of discussion at the conference about how and why SCRUM is
prefereable to deliver this value?

This was something I had struggled to understand and it was via the conference
that I finally wrapped my head around it. The thing that brought it home was
the discussion around this image:

# About Responsibility

# Depends on the country

This was actually a joke that came up during the conference, regarding the way
some things are done. I currently only remember this used about how much
overtime happens in Software development companies for example

But the point can also be made for the applicability of SCRUM. You really need
clients that are aware of the value point in the previous section. Clients
that are aware how SCRUM is better for them when they do not exactly what they
want but they have a certain vision. 

This is maybe something that is more dificult to implement in Macedonia for
example.

# SCRUM is Agile and Adaptive

But be aware of Pros and Cons! 

One key impression I got was that everyone will sort of do SCRUM on their own
way. Even in the company I work at, I had the sense that different teams did
SCRUM differntly. People adapt it to their own needs.

I think the key point to keep in mind is that the changes they make must
provide some value. They should not have any side effects, and they should not
be just to avoid certain key points of SCRUM.

The books and materials always recommend following the ceremonies and the
framework in general more strictly. But I guess after people get aqainted
enough with it they tend to make modifications

# What about effective/productive time?
