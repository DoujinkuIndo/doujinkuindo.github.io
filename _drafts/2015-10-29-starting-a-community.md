## Starting a community from scratch

One of the most difficult things I have found when starting to learn anything new is doing it in isolation. Without a community to learn with, my enthusiasm can wane. 

Kathy Serria, a great blogger, once posted a graph on her [Creating Passionate Users blog](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/03/how_to_be_an_ex.html) shown below.

When starting to learn something new I want to get above the "I suck" threshold as quickly as possible and then move towards the "I kick ass" threshold.
Without feedback of a community of people I can end up on the dropout curve.

For a number of months, I've been trying to learn functional programming by learning the Clojure language.  It has been slow going I feel like I am on the dropout curve.
To that end I have created the [Glasgow Functional Programming Group](http://www.meetup.com/Glasgow-Functional-Programming-Group/) to find other people looking to avoid the dropout curve.
