title: Learning to morph a network topology
---

So, in a similar style to dropout and/or insert. I am interested in dropping or inserting nodes into our net. However, I want the network to learn when it should insert or drop a node.

### Neighbour voting



### Cumulative error

- What if we were training the net with backprop, but each node was also optimising for ???
- Optimising for doing less work? Lazy neurons, where they are always trying to do less, but back prop is the task master telling the good ones to keep going??
