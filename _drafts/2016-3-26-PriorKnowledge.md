> In mechine learning, the typical approach is to hand design the structure of some 'learning' algorithm. Then to let a computer optimise its parameters. Given this approach, in what sense is the computer actually learning anything?


In my opinion this is the problem to solve in machine learning. The goal being to have general learning ability.

We need a way for networks to choose their own activation function, to design their own structure, to ...

Now, the problems.

* These dont have nice gradients that we can follow, so how do we find good solutions? Random search?


Solutions?

* A universal network, or a network witin a network. Where activation functions are made from networks. that is capable of 
*
