YouTube is well know as the website that hosts the cat videos, and while the cat videos are 
abundant and adorable, there's been a new trend on YouTube toward channels and videos that
offer viewers education as well as entertainment. 

My introduction to educational videos started with the general "How To" theme. 
Whether it be building a website, fixing the settings on my computer, 
or how to do my own laundry. (Sorry Mom, but I totally learned that from the internet.)
After spending years on YouTube mostly watching comedy bits and the aforementioned cat videos, 
I was finally introduced to the [Vlogbrothers](http://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers) 
through their human sexuality [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXAoG8vAyzI). 
In my mind, the Vlogbrothers (John and Hank Green) revolutionized YouTube. Their channel 
started in 2007 with Brotherhood 2.0 as a experiment for the brothers and entertainment for their viewers. 
As time went on, their videos started including more educational materials about history and current events.
In 2011, the brothers started what would become a long list of educational channels each with a different theme.
At the time of writing this, the Vlogbrothers have produced:

* [SciShow](www.youtube.com/user/scishow) - a channel about all things science
* [SciShow Space](https://www.youtube.com/user/scishowspace) - a channel about all things astronomy
* Crash Course - a series of playlists for topics at the level of high school course, 
so far there are playlists for:
	* [US Government and Politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrk4oY7UxpQ&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H)
	* [World History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yocja_N5s1I&list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9)

* [Brain Scoop](https://www.youtube.com/user/thebrainscoop) - a channel from the Chief Curiosity Correspondent of The Field Museum in Chicago about animals, 
biology, and other parts of science 
* Health Care Triage - a channel that focuses on providing health information where research is the main source
* How to Adult - a channel that teaches basic thing they don't teach in school about being an adult
* Sexplanations - a channel that focus on sexuality and gender

Outside of the family of Vlogbrothers channels, there's also: 

* [Minute Physics](https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics)
* [Minute Earth](https://www.youtube.com/user/minuteearth)
* [AsapSCIENCE](https://www.youtube.com/user/AsapSCIENCE)
* [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium)
* Mental Floss
* Epic Rap Battles of History

These types of videos are being watched in classes, for assignments, or as extra learning. 
The structure of these types of videos are such that the videos are meant for both entertainment
and education. 



There are hundreds of wonderful educational channels out there and I encourage you to go look for them,
or to start your own. 
(I produced one video on my channel so far, which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leJuucunLak)! 
I hope to one day return and post more.)
