The most fundamental forms of textile creation began—and still thrive—with the simplest of tools. Spinners are fond of observing that all you need to make yarn is [a stick and some fluff](https://medievalspinning.wordpress.com/tools-for-medieval-and-sca-spinning/). Knitters work with two sticks; crocheting uses just one (but it has to have a hook at one end). Looms can be huge and complicated, but the early looms that left behind their archaeological traces were essentially just frames to hang threads on, and weights to give the threads some tension. With these simplest of tools—one scarcely would even call them "mechanisms"—all of the world's string and cloth was made until fairly late in the modern era.

These kinds of very simple tools rely on repetition: the motion of pulling a loop through another loop; the rhythm of attenuating a length of wool, twisting it into yarn, and winding it onto a spindle; the passage of a thread over and under a sequence of other threads. Time is the scalable quantity here: when you have pulled a hundred loops, you have another quarter inch of fabric; when you have spun a foot of yarn, and another foot, and another, slowly but perceptibly the finished yarn gets longer. The attentive patience needed to complete a task of this kind is not only absorbed in continuing the repetition but also in accepting the total duration of the task.
