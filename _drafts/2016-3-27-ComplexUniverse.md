title: A complex universe
---

What if I could explain everything, and do it with only a single short explanation. Like a theory of everything.

Or in other words, what if I designed a system to maximise the integrated information its environment and minimise its own conceptual complexity? 

(so we can specify how everything works in relation to everything else) 

### Integrated information



### Conceptual compelxity



What happens at the max/min? We have all the information, represented in a minimally sized integrated structure???

How is this similar to what evolution is trying to do (optimising conceptual complexity through energy efficiency, and integrated information through memory)? How is this similar to what physicists are trying to do (one equation to describe everything)?

### Fundamental limit

This is like asking, does our universe have a shorter description? 

Given this shorter description, have we then created a universe within a universe? (Is the descriptoion of something the same as the thing itself?)

A contradiction?

Is our universe reducible? Could it be represented with less?
