In *Good Omens*, Agnes Nutter, witch, predicts the Apocalypse with extraordinary accuracy: a little bit after tea time. The end of the world is not only a subject of fiction, however. Serious (and less serious) scientists, politicians, entrepreneurs and other prophets have suggested more potential causes than I would dare to count. It might surprise that there actually is a formula that can predict how long our civiliastion will last and it hardly requires any expert knowlegde or complex calculations! The Doomsday Argument is so simple, so elegant that it seems too good to be true. Yet, it is hotly debated among professional and amatuer philosophers who can all not quite agree why it could not hold. This debate is important, since the Doomsday Argement touches all the big questions are pondering about: *will be reach the singularity*, *are we living in a simulation*, and *where are all the aliens*?

## You are not special

The central idea of the Doomsday Argument is a humbling one: you and I are merly ordinary beings not in a special place in the grander scheme of things. This idea is formulated in the [*Copernian principle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle), defined below.

> **Copernian principle**: you, as an observer, are not in any particulary special time or place.

The Doomsday Principle is a specific application of this idea. Suppose that we make a list of all humans who ever lived and will ever live, ordered by time of birth, i.e.: Adam[^35337836], Eve, ..., you, ..., last person who ever lived, it would be very likely that you and I (not being particulary special) are somewhere in the middle of that list. Based on fossil evidence, anatomically modern humans arose about 200,000 years ago. Hence, it would not be a bad estimate to say that humanity still has roughly 200,000 years left. Enough time to justify worrying about global warming, but not quite enough such the sun running out of nuclear fusion would be an issue.

[^35337836]: Not the biblical Adam, but the person that could be considered the first of species we consider modern humans.

One can formalize the Doomsday Argument using the language of Bayesian reasoning and by assuming vague priors. I find that the figure below suffises.

FIGUUR uitleggen.

It is quite easy to derive 95% confidence intervals. Let us say that we are in the 95% middle part. Best-case, we have only seen 2.5% (1/40) of the total span. This would put the end at 39 times the current duration. In the worst case, we have already seen 97.5% of humanity's story. This means that there is only 1/39 of the duration up to now left...

One can also estimate the end of civiliastion in a slightly different way. Rather taking the time line of when humanity started, one could argue that it is more sensible to take the number of people that have been born to predict the number of people that will be born. The cumulative number of humans having been born is roughly 70 bilion (lifting number from Gott's orginal paper proposing this arumentation). So the number of people yet to be born should be between 1.8 billion and 2.7 trillon, with 95% confidence. Tranlating this in years humany has left requires making assumtions one future demographics. Assuming everying remains roughly the same, doomsday will fall between 12 and 18,000 year from now.

The huge uncertainty of the predictions, together with the two confilcting prediction (depending on how they are made), can be seen as serous critiques on the Doomsday Argement. I am willing to still accept this theory, since making predictions always requires assumptions. Different assumtions will lead to different outcomes. The extreme uncertainty is a consequence of the tiny amount of information that is used. The predictions are still sobering, the world is unlikely to end in the next decade, nor are we likely to reach for the stars and propagate or species over the wholo galaxy for the next million years.  

## Choosing a scientific programming language

## Simulations and aliens

The Doomsday argument is popular among physicists and cosmologists. We only have one universe or earth. The Doomsday Argument allows us to leverage the most out of a singular datapoint. By following its logic, we can reason about some though-provoking theories about life, the universe and everything.

Take the *[Simulation Hypothesis](https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html)*, populized by the influential Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom[^554fe304]. It states the universe around us may very well just be a intricate computer simulation, perhaps a homework assignment of a physics major of some advanced cosmic civilisation. Bostrom's argues that *if* simulating worlds is possible, the number of simulated people would greatly outnumber the *real people*. To be more specific, he claims that at least one of the below statements is likely true (the paper provided Bayesian probabilities):

1. intelligent civilisations generally destoy themselves before reaching a singulary where simulating people is possible;
2. posthuman civilisations have no interest in simulating their evolutionary history;
3. we are very likely to live in a computer simulation.

[^554fe304]: The fiery discussions about the Simulation Hypothesis have famously made Elon Musk and his brother vow that they would no longer discuss it when sitting in a hot tub. It is unknown what they do discuss nowadays.

While I agree with the basic outline of these arguments, I do not really believe that we are in a simulation. Following the Copernian principle, if civisations routinely leave their home planet to colonize huge chuncks of their galaxy, we are vastly more likely to be a part of it than not. This does not seem to be the case, so I would put my money on option 1.

In general, the ideas of the Doomsday Principle are quite pessimistic for sci-fi fans. Given what we observe, intelligent life seems to be quite rare. *If the aliens exist, they would have visited us already*.

## Quantum suicide

Why are we living in a universe with all its fundamental physical constants so perfectly tuned to allow the formation of stars, atoms, physicists and teacups? *Self-sampling* can explain this seemingly cosmic self-tuning. If there exist a vast sea of universes, each with slightly different fundamental physical constants, it makes sense that we happen to inhabit one suited for life. How else could be observe it?

Even though multiverses sound like something from a sciene fiction, they are actually taken seriously by a large fraction of physicists. In the book *Our Mathematical Universe*, cosmologist Max Tegmark suggests that there are [several layers of multiverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Max_Tegmark's_four_levels). For example, multiverses provive an elegant (though controversial) way of interpeting quantum physics. Every possible outcome of a quantum measurement splits the universe into different 'worlds', one where each potential event happens. Tegmark has suggested a diabolic way of proving this theory: a game of *quantum suicide*. Have machine that flips a virtual coin (generates a random bit) by some quantum process and hook it to a gun such that the gun fires when the 'coin' returns 'head'. Place this gun to your head, and repeat this experiment as many times as you want. Remembering, every session has fifty percent chance of making the gun killing you instantly. Now, every session splits the world in two, but you, as an observer, are violently eliminated from the one where the gun has fired. So, from your point of view, the gun will never fire. After ten sessions, the probability of this happinging by luck is less than 1 in 1000. After twenty iterations, less than one in a million, likely enough to convince anyone of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

If quantum suicide works, it would theoretically be possible ot harness this to force yourself into parts of multive that you like. Suppose you buy a lottery ticket, and you rig your quantum suicide machine to kill yourself if you *don't* win. This will force your conciousness to be in the tiny part of the multiverse in which you are a milopnair. Howevery, don't try this at home! Subjectively, you will survivive these macaber experiment, from the point of your loved ones, you will have died[^68d490f7]. This is the paradox of quantum suicide, you can only prove it to yourself!

[^68d490f7]: A different, more technical reason why this would not work in practice is that are more likely to push yourself into world where your machine malfunctions rather than you winning the lottery.

## Conclusion

The Doomsday Argument is mind-boggling concept, deceptively simple, full of paradoxes, obviously correct and yet violates all logic. Much of the hottest topics of our time, the end of the world, the Simulation Hypothesis, the Fermi Paradox, Superintelligent AI, etc. have some root in it or can be approached by it. Most of this blog post is based on *[The Doomsday Calculation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42283303-the-doomsday-calculation?from_search=true)*, by William Poundstone. I could not put it down and it provide topics for conversations for pleny of hot tub sessions.
