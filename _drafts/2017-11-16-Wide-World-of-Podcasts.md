title: The Wide World of Podcasts
---

I love podcasts.

Some background: I'm pretty big into self improvement. 
I hate the idea of stagnating as a person.
I'm scared of it.
I am acutely aware of many of my flaws, and I see stagnation as marking these flaws as acceptable.
So I'm always looking for ways to learn or improve during my daily life.

Enter podcasts.

Now, first and foremost, don't get me wrong here. 
Music is amazing.
I spend an unbelievable amount of time listening to music.
But at work, I listen to podcasts.
When I drive by myself, I listen to podcasts.
Podcasts are an incredible way to distribute information.

Reading is hard. 
It requires you to devote your time to doing this one specific thing.
Sometimes it's hard to justify that when you have other responsibilities or things you want to do.
But listening is easy.
