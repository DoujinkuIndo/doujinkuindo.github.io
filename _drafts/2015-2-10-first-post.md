title: My Path
---

I've spent some time recently re-watching watching episodes of [The Lizzie Bennet Diares](http://www.pemberleydigital.com/the-lizzie-bennet-diaries/)
(vias the DVDs which I now own) and [Welcome to Sanition](http://www.pemberleydigital.com/welcome-to-sanditon/). 
In the modernized versions of these classic works, one of the major themes is 
the idea of following the right path for you, whether or not that path was the one you thought 
you were on. As someone, who was on a strict path for many years and has recently jumped ship, 
this topic is very relevant to me.
