title: Laplacian convolutions
---
Neurons that communicate with frequencies. (With wavelets, thus we get spike timing as well?)

Each neuron recieves signals from other neurons and transforms them into a frequency distrubution. Different signals can easily be convolved with each other in this domain (convoluton in laplacian domain is multiplication). And then a signal is output ...
