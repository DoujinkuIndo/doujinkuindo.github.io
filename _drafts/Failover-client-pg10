Title: Test of PostgreSQL's client failover
Draft: true
---


Today I bring you a test and some measurments of PostgreSQL 10 client replication.

So some time ago i came across this new feature everyone was so excited about. 
At first I didn't realize the implications. 
But then I was doing some testing for failover database.
I request sent by many clients.
So i started to check out different options.

Stolon was out of the way because of containers.
So was patroni.
although both seemed to work fine, none was what I was looking  for.
Of course pacemaker/corosync was considered but failover to a different site was an issue.

Last option was REPMGR.
So it took some time to figure things out.
Eventually, all this good work came to fruition.
My 4 nodes cluster was working alright, eventhough betwork failures were badly handled.
