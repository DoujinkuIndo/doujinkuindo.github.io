*How can I become successful?* Whole forests have been felled to provide the paper to answer this question. You might, quite reasonably, be sceptical whether reading a self-improvement book might have any lasting impact on one's life. Admittingly, most of these books can, at best, be replaced by a blog post or by the author's TED talk. At worst, their primary use is a coaster for your coffee cup. Many do contain some nuggets of wisdom, however. In this short post, I would like to present some of the advice I collected over the years that help me in my daily life.

# The pursuit of success

For the purpose of this post, let us agree on a definition of successful:

> A successful person is someone who can do most of the things they want, both professionally and personally.

We will restrict ourselves to the matter of *time management*, not with issues regarding finance, capabilities or opportunities. Note some aspects of this definition:

- success is personal: it can only be defined according to your **own** goals;
- success should embody both your professional as well as your private life; someone with a dream job but no time for family, friends and personal interest is not successful;
- success is a state, not a goal. It is not some endpoint one can aspire to. Instead, it is a (hopefully) continuous state.

In this light, I am happy to find myself moderately successful. I have an exciting job that allows me to explore all kinds of projects and I have enough free time to enjoy my partner and cat, read a book, have exercise and have friends over for dinner and games.

--Now, I used to believe that, to be successful academically, you have to either be tremendously gifted or work really hard[^87bd764d]. This paints a bit of a grim picture since neither are viable options. + MEER UITLEG--

[^87bd764d]: Though some of the smartest persons I know are also unbelievably hard workers.

# What to do

The first step to the road of success is deciding *what* to do (and coincidently, what not to do). To succeed professionally, one has to become competent in doing something valuable. Specifically, you should invest in acquiring *deep skills* that support your (professional) mission statement. These skills are typically hard to attain and are advantageous for your career.

I will take the life of an academic scientist as an example. Outline your research topic and really make an effort to know the related literature. Think hard which skills might support these best and invest in learning the intricate details of a laboratory technique, a programming language or an essential piece of software. Only by genuinely mastering an aspect of your field, you can stand out among the masses.

Though it is, by definition, very hard to become the best in a domain, everyone has two gifts in which they are better than average. It was Scott Adams who proposed that by combining your strong points, you can create a unique and coveted profile. Taking myself as example, my mission statement is to use computational intelligence to improve biological systems. I am neither the greatest computer scientist nor an outstanding biologist, but I have a broad overview of both field, which makes my expertise quite appreciated. Additionally, there are certain smaller subdomains, such as kernel-based learning and optimal transportation, I have invested in learning the nitty-gritty details. These allow me to take the lead in my own projects.

# Think in systems, not in outcomes

> "Your current habits are perfectly designed to deliver your current results." -- James Clear

When thinking about how to achieve something, most people have a particular target in mind. For example, you want to publish a paper, learn a new language, gain muscle, etc. The problem is that you might become blind-sighted about reaching this particular goal. Worse, reaching a goal is just a point in time, inevitably afterwards you will end up with a 'now what?'-moment?

A powerful idea regarding performance and productivity is letting go of a *goal-oriented mindset* and embracing a *systems-oriented mindset*. This means that you try to cultivate daily or weekly habits that will help you grow into the person you want to be.

# In brief

If most self-improvement books could be summarized into a blog post, then it is only fair a blogpost on self-improvement can be condensed in a sentence:

> Think strategically about your goals, create and follow habits to achieve them and make a plan.

# Resources

These are the books I found most helpful in organizing my life.

## The Organized Mind by

## The books of Cal Newport

Cal Newport is a no-nonsense person who practices what he preaches. I can recommend most of his books, especially "So Good They Can't Ignore You". By his own admission it can be summarized as:

1. do fewer things;
2. do them better;
3. know why you do them.

## Atomic Habits by James Clear

"Atomic Habits" by [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) is quite instructive in how to organize your life as to generate excellent outcomes. His weekly newsletter is the only newsletter I enjoy reading in full every time.

## The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

A classical and still highly relevant. In summary, the habits are:

1. (internal) be proactive and take control;
2. (internal) begin with the end in mind (i.e., work towards a goal);
3. (internal) put first things first (i.e., make a plan);
4. (exterior) think win-win (i.e., look at how you can both benefit when working together);
5. (exterior) seek to understand, then to be understood;
6. (exterior) synergize (i.e., look how working together can create better outcomes than working separately);
7. develop good habits to cultivate yourself physically, mentally, socially and spiritually.

You will find echoes of these habits in my own advice.
