title: Statistical Rethinking [text-book review]
---

After reading the excellent reviews in Amazon, I decided to give it a go to the text-book Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath. Long story short, I can praise enough the author for this great book and I wish I could have discovered it longg time ago, when I first started doing Bayesian Data Analysis.

The target reader for the book is a beginner or intermediate data analyst, with only a basic knowledge of applied statistics. The author did a great job of making sure to guide the reader from very simple concepts up to some intermediate level modeling techniques. I particularly appreciated the presence of plenty of excercises and optional boxes where more advanced concepts are described, without getting in the way of less experienced readers which want to get as much as possible on their first read of the material.

The book also contains lots of examples, using R and a companion open-source library named after the book. Even though I prefer much more the Python eco-system for doing Data Science, and I haven't touched R for quite a few years now, following the examples is very easy. The author also encapsuled all of the Stan models into it's own wrapper. I personally would have appreciated to see more Stan code, which I find quite easily interpretable, and would be anyway the language of choice for many after completing this book. Nonetheless, the companion library seems to be very capable and will centainly bring you through all the examples in the book without any effort. For more advanced models though, Stan offers more flexibility.

Regarding the content, I particularly appreciated the chapters about Information Theory and Multilevel models. These are probably the most advanced ones, but they are easy to follow and quite engaging also for a more experienced user..

Throughout the entire book, McElreath reiterate the importance of using counterfactual plots to understand the absolute effect of a feature on the target variable, and WAIC to compare alternative models. This is something I've particularly appreciated, and I believe it should be promoted more often. I wish these kind of advices were given more regularly to Data Scientists.

To summarize, a very enjoyable book, packed with important lessons for beginner and intermediate practitioners who want to better understand how to do proper Bayesian Data Analysis.
