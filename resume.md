Hello,

If you're interested in hiring me (I'm flattered!), here's some information to help in your decisions.

# Résumé

Download the [latest version of my résumé](../documents/mikaelgramont-resume.pdf) in PDF format.

# LinkedIn

I kept my resume short and sweet, but if you want more details on a particular job, check out
[my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikaelgramont) as I put in more details into it.

# Code samples

For code samples, [feel free to checkout my Github account](https://github.com/mikaelgramont).

However, allow me to recommend [the Surfing Dirt repos](https://github.com/surfingdirt) (Surfing Dirt is a personal
project of mine) where you can find:
* [a PHP-based Rest API](https://github.com/surfingdirt/rest-api)
* [a GraphQL server](https://github.com/surfingdirt/graphql), and
* [a React client for a PWA](https://github.com/surfingdirt/web).

Those combined currently power [https://beta.surfingdirt.com](https://beta.surfingdirt.com).
