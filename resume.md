### Fire and Forget Queue (Development)
The project was started from the need to somehow overcome unstable web service utilization, which disrupted bigger workflow and caused lots of manual work when repairing the workflow. 

The queue was built using SQL Server, where all web service calls were preserved in the database using serialization and Windows services would execute queued tasks by deserializing tasks using reflection and then execute them. This way, the workflow was always done correctly and only failed cases from the queue were repaired and no additional manual work was needed. The queue monitor was built for easier tracking of queued, executed, and failed tasks. 

Technologies used: C#, SQL Server, ASP.NET MVC 5, and Bootstrap.
