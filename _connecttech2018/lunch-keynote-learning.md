> Failure is a situation not a trait.
> Failure is not forever.
> Failure is learning, a step on the way.

Instead of avoiding failure embrace your "rights of passage", doing things for
yourself gives you insight into your limits, or lack of there of.

"Not all who wander are lost"...
What does _Undirected_ learning look like? Things we often discount as
_leisure_ aka. _unproductive, wasted time_  But really, it's through wandering
that we explore. Through exploration we discover novelty aka the magic _Innovation_

So do you need to Innovate?  Then plan to Wander.  A worthy place to start is
something called the _Adjacent Possible_  moving one step over from what you do
know into something you don't.

This talk got me thinking on something I learned reading page.links[0]

#### Explore vs Exploit Conundrum!

Why do we get trapped, stop looking and wandering.  Turns out it's often just a
matter of perspective.  How long you give your time horizon, that determines
if you're willing to risk failure for the opporunity of a new discovery.

* Children are wired to Explore, time is infinite, cost of delay, or wrong decision is low.
and the probability is high you could discover a new favorite.
* Aged adults are wired to Exploit. With a full list of things
that prove pleasurable, and a limited time to spend, you're simply not as likely
to find a new favorite.  you invest in re-experiencing things that are known rewards.

If we only ever Exploit,  this kind of success is lost in the dust.  The concept
