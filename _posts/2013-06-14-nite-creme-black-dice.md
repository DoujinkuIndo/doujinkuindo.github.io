# Nite Creme — Black Dice

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=taatcc0thdc I really like Black Dice. But sometimes I'm really not sure why. This isn't a song to drive to, to walk around to, to relax to, or anything of the sort, in the traditional way that much of my music falls under such categories in my mind. By most objective measures it's not particularly _pleasant _music either - "sludgy" comes to mind when I attempt to quantify this album. But something draws me inexorably to them - I think it has to do with the samples they use. One of their hallmarks is the use of human vocal samples, processed and churned out to sound like something else. It happens here in real time - distended yelps and yowls are stretched and crushed like taffy, nearly beyond the point of recognition. But something in our brains recognizes that as a _human_ voice, if only barely. It's sort of like the aural equivalent of the uncanny valley - a sound that thickly blurs the line between human and emphatically not so. As if Black Dice were mad scientists, contorting and mutating voices into whatever they can get away with. To me, at least, it's fascinating._ _
