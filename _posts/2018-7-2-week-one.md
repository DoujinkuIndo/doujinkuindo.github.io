This first week was mostly a learning week for us. The week before, we got the paper that inspired this study and the proposal for this study to read as the background. Much of the first part of this week was spent on setting up or blogs, but we got to researching our respective tasks in the project.

## Photometry
Rory and Thom are leading the photometry side of this study. Dr. G gave us some practice exercises that ended up giving us some useful code for the first part of the photometry code that we're writing and will use to analyze data in the future. We're still learning more about the process, but have made a lot of progress towards understanding our job, and should be able to give accurate photometric analysis soon. You can read in more detail about what we each did individually on our [blogs](https://gosnellresearchgroupsummer2018.github.io/people/). 

## Astrometry
The other part of this study involves astrometry, and Marta is taking care of this for the group. So far, she's begun writing a code that will help us apply accurate world coordinate system (WCS) data to all our .fits data files and enable us to line up the sources of detections in different filters so that Rory and Thom can create color-magnitude diagrams.
