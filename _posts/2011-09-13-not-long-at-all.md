Jakob Neilsen has an interesting article titled [How Long Do Users Stay on Web Pages?](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/page-abandonment-time.html). One of the interesting comments made is "...the average is not the most fruitful way of analyzing user behaviors." He then shows how user behaviour fits a negative Weibull distribution (based on research by Chao Liu and others at Microsoft Research).
