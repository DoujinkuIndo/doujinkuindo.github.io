title: January 26, 2020 Whales at the Virginia Winter Wildlife Festival!
---

Susan and I headed on a whale watch from the Virginia Beach Aquarium. We saw a number of humpback whales diving and showing their backs and a few flukes but then this one jumped out of the water twice! I did not get a good picture but it was an amazing sight! ![humpback](https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/60344776/original.jpeg?1580086758)
