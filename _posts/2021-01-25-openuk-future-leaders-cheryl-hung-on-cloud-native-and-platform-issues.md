In which I review the explosion of cloud native, and make 10 predictions across the tech and ecosystem in 2021.

My ten predictions, in no particular order:
1. Kubernetes for the Edge
1. Service Mesh consolidation
1. Web Assembly and eBPF will be hot technologies
1. Pluggable developer and operator experience
1. Chaos Engineering practices
1. Rise of FinOps
1. More Rust in Cloud Native
1. GitOps Grows Significantly
1. Cross Cloud Becomes More Real
1. End user driven open source
