Just finished Pierre Monat's _L'Histoire de la Bible_ (The History of the Bible).

Confirms that what we consider solid - "The Tradition" - is absolutely not. It is not at the origin, and by the way there's no origin. It becomes solid with the centuries, because we solidify what we cling to. What we believe to be solid becomes solid. But this solid object, after this solidification process, has nothing to do with what origin it thinks it represents. Its fondations are liquid.
