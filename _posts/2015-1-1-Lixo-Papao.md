The first and original project was developed by Design Students from KEA (Denmark) and Senac (Brazil) in the [The S√£o Paulo Project](http://www.thesaopauloproject.com/). 

Our project was focused in the technology and when we met Lixo Pap√£o, we combine two ideias to build a new. Thanks to Poly (design in the first project), that is joined in our team, we combined two projects.
