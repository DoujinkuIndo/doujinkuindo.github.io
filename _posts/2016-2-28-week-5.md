<h3>Week :five: </h3>
***  
__:question: Questions :question:__  
*1. What did you do this past week?*  
    Allowed myself to focus on some of my other classes since we didn't have a project to work on. I went to classes and kept up with the google doc.
    
*2. What's in your way?*  
    I think I need to get a group together to go over practice questions with each other. 
    
*3. What will you do next week?*  
    This next week my goal is to get a group together and make practice questions. I also need to go over past google docs.

    I've been a little frusterated because I've missed some quizzes by 1 or 2 minutes and end up getting zeros for the quizzes because they start exactly at 10. If you run late like I do by 5 minutes, I reccommend leaving earlier than planned and don't bet on being able to get in to class exactly at class time to make a quiz. If you think your class before it will run late a lot then you should maybe change your schedule. 
    Other than that, I'm feeling okay about the upcoming exam. I'm mostly nervous because I'm unsure what to expect from an exam on canvas.

  Staring at computer screens is super bad for your sleep schedule. I install flux on all my laptops to help with this. It'll add the appropriate filter on your computer screen that goes with the time of day. It's a super easy install and run. Check it out here: [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)
