I looked at the numbers on data center emissions, and highlight sustainable infrastructure tools and trends for 2023.

Recommended tools:

* [Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-footprint) is a tool to estimate energy use and carbon emissions from public cloud usage.
* [Kepler](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler) (Kubernetes Efficient Power Level Exporter) uses eBPF to probe energy-related system stats and exports as Prometheus metrics.
* [Kube-green](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green) is a simple Kubernetes add-on that automatically shuts down (some of) your resources when you don't need them.
* [Kube-downscaler](https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-downscaler) scales down or "pauses" Kubernetes workloads during non-work hours.

Recommended groups:

* [CNCF TAG Environmental Sustainability](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability) launched in May 2022 and will be releasing a survey in Q4 2022, keep an eye out!
