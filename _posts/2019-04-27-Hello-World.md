title: Hello World!
---
Wow, many thanks to Barry Clark and his [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)! I have literally set up my website in 10 minutes while sitting at an airport terminal. 

My goal for this blog is to write posts that explain concepts I am learning in school using straightforward language. I remember things best when I have explained them to someone else. And someday I will have practiced enough that other people will feel more knowledgeable after listening to me. 

Here are the ground rules for writing posts that I am going to try to obey: 

1. Revise every post at least once.  
2. Posts should be 500 words or less. 
3. Always cite my sources and references.  
4. Keep it interesting for the reader.

Letâ€™s get started!
