Fresh post from Seth Godin, where he suggests we start some converstations with this:>"We'd like to roll the ... technology ... back to the way it used to be, even though it almost never works out that way. Here's why it's going to be different this time." via [Seth's Blog: Forward or back?](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/forward-or-back.html).

Me-thinks I'll use this in a conversation or two. :)
