title: First Guide Up!

Finished the general layout of the site last night, still can't get over how simple it is to use Jekyll.

I love Flask because you can start a web server with like 10 lines of code, and this has been just as easy. GitHub and the jekyll-now framework helped a ton, of course.

Even added some custom SCSS, so while I'm far from a front end guy I can at least tweak things as needed. Definitely looking forward to this medium.

Anywho, added the first installment of the PDF Merger guide, which has been quite popular on Youtube. I'll slowly keep adding to it over the next couple days until we end up with the final version.

Reviewing it has also showed me how bad my style was 6 months ago when I first made the videos. Whoops. This site will definitely get much better, cleaner versions.
