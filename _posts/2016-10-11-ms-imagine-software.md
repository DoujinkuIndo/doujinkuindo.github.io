As an ARU student in the Department of Computing & Technology, I have access to Microsoft products available in the [Microsoft Imagine Premium](https://catalog.imagine.microsoft.com/en-us/about) program through the university's [ELMS WebStore](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_cs=1&cmi_mnuMain=bdba23cf-e05e-e011-971f-0030487d8897&ws=c70fe1ab-c08b-e011-969d-0030487d8897&vsro=8).

The products available can be categorized accordingly:
<ul>
  <li>Operating Systems</li>
  <li>Developer Tools</li>
  <li>Servers</li>
  <li>Applications</li>
</ul>

## Operating Systems

I used the Windows 10 Education Edition key to upgrade my own Windows 10 Home Edition, [as it was clearly superior](http://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Win10CompareTable_FY17.pdf), while making use of the provided Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 by making them into 64-bit virtual machines in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

## Applications

Although there are countless other applications in the university's WebStore, many of them are outdated, some of them have been made freely accessible outside of the Microsoft Imagine service and others aren't currently of any interest or use to me.
