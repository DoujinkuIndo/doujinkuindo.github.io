As an ARU student in the Department of Computing & Technology, I have access to Microsoft products available in the [Microsoft Imagine Premium](https://catalog.imagine.microsoft.com/en-us/about) program through the university's [ELMS WebStore](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_cs=1&cmi_mnuMain=bdba23cf-e05e-e011-971f-0030487d8897&ws=c70fe1ab-c08b-e011-969d-0030487d8897&vsro=8).

The products available can be categorized accordingly:
<ul>
  <li>Operating Systems</li>
  <li>Developer Tools</li>
  <li>Servers</li>
  <li>Applications</li>
</ul>

## Operating Systems

I used the **Windows 10 Education Edition** key to upgrade my own **Windows 10 Home Edition**, [as it was clearly superior](http://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Win10CompareTable_FY17.pdf), while making use of the provided **Windows 7** and **Windows 8.1** by making them into 64-bit virtual machines in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

## Applications

<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/access" target="_blank"><img src="https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSImages/Logo_Access_159x60.png?version=23a3d796-28d8-46a2-2122-db76fcfb5814" alt="Access 2016"></a>

Used to manage databases.

<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/project" target="_blank"><img src="https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSImages/Logo_Project_163x60.png?version=43c940d9-648a-a831-7402-d31bf06143b6" alt="Project Professional 2016"></a>

A useful project management tool. I will definitely use Project, as using it is part of my assignment.

<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/visio" target="_blank"><img src="https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSImages/Logo_Visio_135x60.png?version=098c83c4-7a98-d424-0535-f5b7da2ade19" alt="Visio Professional 2016"></a>

Used to make diagrams, flowcharts and the like.

Although there are countless other applications in the university's WebStore, many of them are outdated, some of them have been made freely accessible outside of the Microsoft Imagine service and others aren't currently of any interest or use to me.
