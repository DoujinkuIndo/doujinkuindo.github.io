Quick tip on getting the Network Connections control panel applet, do one of the following:*WIN+R, ncpa.cpl<enter>


*CTRL-SHIFT-ESC, Applications, File, New Task, ncpa.cpl <enter>
This will give you quick access to changing network settings, useful if you have no mouse... as per a workstation I'm working on right now.
