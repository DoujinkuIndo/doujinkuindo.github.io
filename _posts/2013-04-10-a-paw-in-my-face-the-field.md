# A Paw In My Face — The Field

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_KmNsGoXHk This is, like, microhouse, maybe? Techno, but minimalist, ambient, something or other. Axel Willner is intent on finding one great timbre, a loop that sounds great, just so warm and inviting, and playing it over and over as a variety of chords, maybe some syncopated drum clicks and shakes in the background, until it feels like driving and driving and driving — sometimes the clouds break and the sun shines through, sometimes the corn fields end and you see a city — at the 1:30 mark or so it gets interesting-er, but only a step up again, and then — back to regular. The transitions aren't transitions to anything; we stick on the transition, loop over and over, become intimately familiar with the structure of the song, until just the point of irritation, until it clicks away into the next one.
