## 2. Breakout Activity
### Terminology
<dl>
  <dt>Homophily</dt>
  <dd>The natural tendency for people to interact with others who are similar to themselves based on almost any dimension. </dd>
  <dt>Induced Homophily</dt>
  <dd>Groups created as a result of outside forces such as age, socioeconomic status, race, gender, etc.</dd>
  <dt>Choice Homophily</dt>
  <dd>Individuals will find others similar to themselves regardless of the group setting.</dd>
</dl>


In groups of 4-5, analyze the effect of social tools on niche culture:

**Cameras mandatory, comb your hair**
- Share a niche community of your choice that you are a member of. We'll define "niche" as one not shared by another member of your breakout group.
- Is this group created through Induced or Choice Homophily?
- Did this niche exist before 2005?
- What instituions related to that niche were disrupted by social tools? Did they adapt? If so, how? What it effective?
- What are the top content creators in this niche that you follow? What platforms do they use? Do they have your trust?
- Are there opposing views in this niche? How are they handled by the community?

Link to your top niche content creators (with the niche) in the `fall-2020` Slack Channel. Add a reaction to your faves.

After the session, Tony will pick volunteers for a Fishbowl discussion on the best and weirdest. 

**Cameras mandatory for active speakers**
