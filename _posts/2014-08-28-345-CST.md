# 3:45 CST

It’s 3:45 CST, and I have a lab at 10:00 that required what is truly my full attention; and a meeting at 12:30; and work from 14:00 to 17:00; and then work again from 19:00 to 21:00; and in between all that somehow I need to find food for myself and polish up two labs due in two days with the full knowledge that I really truly need tomorrow (not today, because good lord it’s already been Tuesday for three hours and forty-six minutes) to do homework that should be done this weekend, except it won’t be done this weekend, it can’t, because I’ll be busy not just Saturday but Friday through Sunday, except for a three-hour bus ride home through unknown territory, and at this point the insomnia keeping me awake is more than a cute annoyance, but is legitimately verging on the point of self-endangerment, where I know it’s not the caffeine doing this but a strange manic burst of primal untapped energy rising up from deep within my soul, responding to my stimuli as would a primeval hunter-gatherer who has been stalked by a lioness for twenty hours with no verge on stopping, driven to a point beyond fight-or-flight into autonomous-survival-mode, to the point where a solid five hours of sleep starting now wouldn’t even particularly help, and I know this because I’ve done it before, twice over the summer when I’ve been overcome by a crushing sense of foreboding with respect to my future, once last semester on the eve of a math midterm for which I was woefully, disastrously unprepared, and once nearly a year ago to the day, on Thanksgiving, when I slept three hours and taught a class near-catatonic to the point where I collapsed on a marble floor and needed a shot of Red Bull brought to my location and injected directly into my mouth, and once more the summer before on the eve of my move-out day, and on each day I managed to get five hours of sleep and it did not help, it could not help, because this was a tiredness and a lethargy of the mind and soul, not of the body, and the body was merely the vessel by which my soul tries to, on each occasion, and typically without much success, warn my body to slow down, it wasn’t built for this, and even though I can see the crash ahead I can’t do anything to dampen the system, it’s too late, I’m too tired to sleep, and there’s nothing to do but turn on all the lights and try to do *something* so as not to waste what would have been the precious daylight hours of the following day, now swept under the rug of hazy, listless perception.
