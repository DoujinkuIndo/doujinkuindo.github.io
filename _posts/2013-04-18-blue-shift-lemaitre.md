# Blue Shift — Lemaitre

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqkzR0sdtuU More music devoid of context, but with nothing to suffer from it. Dance music, Norwegian indie-electronica, disco and tech, combining the 70s and the 00s, real vocals and fake vocals, choirs and things repressed into the background, swelling in and out, this music is theatrical; it has nothing to declare or communicate, it only wants to entertain and be fixated upon, one riff repeated endlessly for four minutes until it ends, and your ear possibly wants more, enough to listen again, perhaps, enough to seek out other sons; it has to stay interesting, but it has to stay predictable, and it in that sense is very much pop music; none of this strange Scandinavian indie sweetheart scene, not even disco; it's not feel-good, it's not feel-at-all, it's not thinking-music, it's _go-on, go-on, keep-doing-what-you're-doing_ _everything-is-fine_, and it swells and sweeps you off your feet and carries you away.
