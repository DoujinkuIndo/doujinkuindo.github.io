title: Welcome, lightweight web.

Like many people I've started to get annoyed with Wordpress.  It's large and clunky and always has security issues (which is testament to its popularity, and admittedly worse if you forget to update it regularly).

In this blog I am trying out Jekyll, which is hosted here via GitHub Pages. Combined with Prose.io for writing blog posts with markdown, it's a really great way to maintain a lightweight blog that allows me to focus on content over interface.

I suspect Jekyll is just the start of what could be called the lightweight web movement. As Web 2.0 made blogging easy for people, popular tools like Wordpress became increasingly complex to cater to the increasingly diverse group of people using it. An small industry has arisen around this, with books and courses and specialist jobs appearing, all in support of Wordpress.

It doesn't really seem that surprising that in the wake of Wordpress's success there would be demand for small, simpler blogging tools.  The reader view available in many modern browsers is testament to this move towards simplicity, and mobile users have definitely tired of navigating heavy sites with small devices.  

Another alternative to cut-down blogging platforms like Jekyll is site builders, like Squarespace, Wix and Weebly (and my favorite, [Webflow](http://webflow.io)).  These tools seem to be aiming to streamline the creation of web sites, but seem more focused on helping people to build more "professional" looking sites, without needing the template-hacking front-end skills that a Wordpress theme maker needs.

The web is always in a state of change, though, with new fads and ideas appearing regularly and fading just as fast. It will be interesting to watch the lightweight web and see where it goes.
