Absolutely been falling in love with Gregory Porter these past few weeks. Perhaps tellingly, I found an article (now lost to the sands of time) in which a woman documented her divorce by charting, via last.fm, which artists she listened to most in the months (years, really) following the divorce. She documented which were good days and which were bad days, and the most popular artists for each; which artists led to a breakdown, and which helped build her back up.
For the life of me, I can't remember which Gregory Porter was. I call the two sides of the coin descriptive and prescriptive music. Descriptive music buries you deeper. If you're sad, it tells you how sad you are, coos about the sadness of the world, pats your head and draws the blinds and turns on the radio and brews you tea. Prescriptive music is a recipe, a cure. It tells you you'll be fine, helps you to your feet; shifts genre subtly beneath you, turns you around and sends you on your way. Which you listen to in times of need, I think, says a lot about you. (The title of this blog, for those who have forgotten, is Battle Rhymes for Battle Times.)

Anyway. I can't remember if the author said that Gregory Porter was descriptive or prescriptive. I've been listening to him endlessly, and I'm still not sure which I'd call him. These aren't easily quantifiable emotions in these songs. Magnificent stuff. 
Above is Real Good Hands, which is about a man trying to reassure his fiance's parents that he's right for their daughter. This is love-and-relationship music, but on another level of maturity. If I'm used to 20-year-olds writing about sex and drugs, and The National is 40-year-olds writing about marriage and commitment for the 30-year-old dad-rocker crowd, this is a 40-year-old man singing about happiness and love.

Similarly: above is Hey Laura, an accusatory song with a calm, reasonable tone; a man asking his woman if there's someone else, but telling her he'll believe a lie. It's not angry, it's not sad, it's not resigned. It's oddly calm and honest. Perhaps it exhibits a kind of maturity that I, a nineteen-year-old boy, am yet to encounter.
