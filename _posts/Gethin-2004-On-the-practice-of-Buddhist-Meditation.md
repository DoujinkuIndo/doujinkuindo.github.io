> _The problem of the term 'meditation'_  
> Few, I suppose, would wish to dispute the suggestion that one of the primary concerns of early Buddhist texts is 'meditation'. It is perhaps a little surprising then that it is by n o means clear what Pali (or Sanskrit) term English, or for that matter German, words such as 'meditate/meditieren' and 'meditation' trans­late. Sometimes it is suggested that bhaveti/ bhavana are the corresponding terms, but these words, representing causative forms from the root bhü, more stricty mean 'bringing into being', 'cultivation', or 'development', and certainlythere are many contexts in the early texts where the translation 'meditation' or 'meditates' would n o t work. Alternatively one might suggest jhana/jhayati de­riving from the Sanskrit root dhya, and indicating 'deep thought', but in Bud­dhist literature jhana comes to have a specific technical meaning: someone who practices jhana is not simply meditating, but rather someone who has accom­plished a certain level of proficiency in meditation and attained a relatively sta­ble state of deep concentration or absorption, defined in precise psychological and emotional terms. Another candidate is yoga, which is a term that is used generally in Indian religious writings to mean spiritual practice and thus em­braces various kinds of meditation technique. Certainly terms such as yogin and yogavacara are used in Buddhist texts in the sense of practitioner of yoga or 'meditator'. However, in the earliest Buddhist texts these terms are not found, and yoga is used not in this sense but in the sense of an emotional and psycho­logical ' bond ' that ties one to the round of rebirth.
