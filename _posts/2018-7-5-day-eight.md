After a day off for the Fourth of July, I'm back writing some photometry codes. I want to start by figuring out a more accurate way to detect sources in an image, and to do that I'm going to use aperture photometry. I'll make a new code in the NGC6819 repo's ["photometry codes"](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819) folder called "aperture_photometry.py" that will more accurately subtracts the background from an image than the [code](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20codes/source_detection.py) I was using on [Tuesday](https://thom-ory.github.io/day-seven/). Also, instead of getting an image out, this code will save a text file to the desktop. This will actually be a very big first step that I think I'm close to completing; after today, if I'm able to do aperture photometry accurately, we'll have all the tools we need to get the data necessary to make color-magnitude diagrams. So, we should have that data by next week, and I can start writing a code that will draw HR-diagrams for us. 

If I am able to get
