After a day off for the Fourth of July, I'm back writing some photometry codes. I want to start by figuring out a more accurate way to detect sources in an image, and to do that I'm going to use aperture photometry. I'll make a new code in the NGC6819 repo's ["photometry codes"](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819) folder called "aperture_photometry.py" that will more accurately subtract the background from an image than the [code](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20codes/source_detection.py) I was using on [Tuesday](https://thom-ory.github.io/day-seven/). Also, instead of getting an image out, this code will save a text file to the desktop. This will actually be a very big first step that I think I'm close to completing; after today, if I'm able to do aperture photometry accurately, we'll have all the tools we need to get the data necessary to make color-magnitude diagrams. So, we should have that data by next week, and I can start writing a code that will draw HR-diagrams for us. If I am able to get all this done in a reasonable amount of time today, then I'll make a "master" code that will be called "accurate_source_detection.py" that will combine both previous codes; i.e., it will use aperture photometry to find the sources, save a text file to the desktop that gives information about those sources, and create an image that circles all sources in blue. 

## Coding
The first thing that I did was go back to [source_detection.py](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20codes/source_detection.py) and try to make it run a little bit better. It was detecting way more sources in the image than were actually there because of noise, especially towards the edges. So, I restricted the field of view to only look at the center of the image and bumped up the threshold required to be considered a source. This is what I got compared to the raw data: 

![sources]({{thom-ory.github.io}}/images/sources_2.png) ![rawdata]({{thom-ory.github.io}}/images/rawdata_2.png)
