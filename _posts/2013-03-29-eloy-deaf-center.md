# Eloy — Deaf Center

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1Shx98a7rU Deaf Center is Norwegian, ambient, neoclassical, weird and quiet and lush and incredibly creepy. It's music for _something-is-about-to-happen_ and it's music for _think-on-your-sins_; it's music for _take-a-walk-at-night-when-you-shouldn't_ and it's music for _keep-working, keep-your-head-down, keep-calm_. It's especially music for meditation; it's drone and slow and horrid and peaceful; dramatic without being melodramatic; intentioned and controlled yet expressive; dark and sinister but without the cruelty or horror of most dark ambient. It's not about death or disease or war, it's not about sadness. It's about what kinds of sounds evoke a reaction, and it's incredibly successful._ _
