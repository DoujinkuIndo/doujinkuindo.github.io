# Can't Keep It In — Cat Stevens

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zT2YU6-cB0 Tied again and again to travel; this, I showed to a friend who wanted music, asked for something with dynamics, that grew from simplicity into exquisite complexity; this, I showed my mother, driving south along the Henry Hudson parkway, passing 168th and Fairway, rediscovering old Cat Stevens from her youth; this, I listened to on the bus up to Bear Mountain, psyching myself up for my last Spirit Day; this, on the plane high over Pennsylvania coming home to New York for the first time; this, driving in the car to Illinois for the first time. Activity releases emotion; transportation is activity without the visceral, cathartic motion of exercise  When we move, our souls are jetlagged behind us; the way to keep up is with music, to feel at such heights as you would if you had to walk the whole way.
