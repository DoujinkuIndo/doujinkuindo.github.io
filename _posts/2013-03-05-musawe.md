# Musawe — The Seatbelts/Yoko Kanno

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co-itvSCNiI I discover things backwards a lot, it turns out. I fell in love with the [Cowboy Bebop OST ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Cowboy_Bebop)before I ever actually saw the [show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop). Much of the soundtrack is [jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2rVnRwW0h8) and bebop, but it does range as far as [funk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmIsNpDimQ0), blues, [opera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPhUnBveGgY), singer-songwriter [ballads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03qBqP2I4p8), classical, etc. For me, it was wonderful starter kit into the world of everything-but-modern-pop. _Musawe_ is an original piece, but done in the style of [gnawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnawa_music); set to images of space travel, off-planet bazaars, and syndicate violence, it is surreal and transcendental. It's gorgeous and subtle and entirely out of place, which puts it exactly in place. Gnawa (a distinctly _modern_ Morrocan musical genre) is a form of liturgy: "_recreat[ing] the first sacrifice and the genesis of the universe by the evocation of the seven main manifestations of the divine demiurgic activity_". Reappropriated and used as the backing music to an anime about space bounty hunters, is this disrespectful? Does anyone care?
