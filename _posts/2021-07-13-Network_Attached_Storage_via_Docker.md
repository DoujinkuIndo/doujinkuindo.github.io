# Welcome
"NAS, I am not talking about american rapper.
I recently switched from android to apple, and I am already tired of 'my icloud is full!'. thus birth my own Network Attached Storage >> best part I can connect external storage too ;)"

## What is NAS?

 A network attach storage is a storage device that is connected to network giving access to client around the world. That means your own personal cloud storage system without any storage limit. Users can increase thier storage as they go, like plugging in your old usbs or HDD or SSD to network. so you can access your data from anywhere!.
 
 
## Tools USED :

[Balena OS] (https://www.balena.io/os/docs/raspberrypi3/getting-started/) << Check it out! Get started with Balana os. Deploy your first project 'Hello-World' to get used to the CLI or Web client (Balena dashboard).

[NextCloud] (https://nextcloud.com/) is create .... you know what check out this why I choose > [Nextcloud] (https://nextcloud.com/athome/)
 
#Now the Process of installing NAS on your Raspi:
