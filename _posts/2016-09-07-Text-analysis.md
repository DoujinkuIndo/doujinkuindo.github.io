###So, how do computer change textual analysis?

Well, without reading anything or even having any prior knowledge of the subject, one thing comes to mind.  Just like computers do math faster than we do, they better be able to analyze text much faster than I can.  I would not want to count every unique word in a book.  If you ask me, that is absolutely insane, but a computer is designed to do that, to be that good.  

I would like to respit out the break down of what is digital humanities and then give my own interpretation of each of the 7 steps.  

1. Visualize single texts 

Not much to say about this step, other than that it is what it is.  Digital humanists aim to see patterns and hidden paths within texts that other may not see, or simply may not be so straightforwardly shown.  

2. Choose features to represent texts

This.   This right here is something I was and still am confused about.  All I can think of is literally do a text alternative such as video or drawings.  However, it simply refers to different ways to see the texts without using the words, persay.  

3. Identify distinctive vocabulary 

I find this the most interesting.  Being able to question and find unique traits to the text.  Wanting to ask why and why some more.  Why does the auther do it this specific way verses another way.  

4. Find or organize works

This is decently cool, essentially drawing the roadmap of someones life's work.  You can present the world with what they did and how they got there.  So cool!

5. Model literary forms or genres

This is simple, building and being able to see the relationships and connections between different works is quite fascinating!

6. Model social boundaries

Statistical data matters too!  lol, this is what I read basically. 

7. Unsupervised modeling 

This is by far my favorite part.  Not knowing anything, just waiting to see and learn what you can from something, letting the learned knowledge be what is important rather than the actual texts involved.
