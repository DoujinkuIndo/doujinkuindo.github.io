## Programming Background

I knew R prior to the course when I learned how to use it at work. I
first started learning it when I was carrying out experiments and needed
to analyze my data. The way that I learned was through one of my
coworkers who used R to analyze his experiments. He taught me the basics
of how to use R and the packages I needed to do a basic analysis, mainly
ggplot. From there I did some Datacamp courses in R and self-taught what
I needed to do my job.

I do enjoy using R but I find the many ways of doing one thing
frustrating at times. Finding a quick answer online for how to do
something can sometimes be tricky and take a while whereas with other
languages I’ve used I usually have better luck with the online support
material.

I don’t do any analysis anymore at work in R but I do use it for
creating excel files for data collection as well as formatting data so
that it’s ready to be uploaded into our database. Our database is
structured with controlled vocabulary for the columns available as well
as the column values so I use R to get it in the correct format and as a
quality check to ensure there are no errors being loaded into the
database.

I do find that since I’ve been using MYSQL, I have a much easier time
selecting data tables in R by using SQL instead of R packages.
