Although I mostly blog for myself, I'm curious as to how well my blog performs. So every month on the 20th this year I want to post a simple blog status report. These reports will include statistics for the previous month: from the 20th to the 19th. For instance, this blog report covers the time period of December 20, 2017, through January 19, 2017.

## Tools & Measures

Two of the tools I use are from Google. Namely, these are [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) and [Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/). I will also use Amazon's [Alexa rankings](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hendrixjoseph.github.io) (completely unrelated to the voice assistant Alexa).

## Alexa

* Global Rank &rarr 2,476,245  
* Rank in the United States &rarr 452,281
* Total Sites Linking In &rarr 80

## Google Analytics

* Sessions &rarr 1,356
* Users &rarr 970
* Pageviews &rarr 1,989

## Adsense

* Estimated earnings &rarr $1.84
* Impressions &rarr 1,174
* Clicks &rarr 1

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $1.84 / 1.356 = $1.37
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $1.84 / 1.989 = $0.93
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $1.84 / 1.174 = $1.57
* Earnings / day = $1.84 / 31 = $0.06
* Sessions / day = 1356 / 31 = 43.7
* Pageviews / day = 1,989 / 31 = 64.2
* Impressions / day = 1,174 / 31 = 37.9

## Conclusion

Nothing too exciting. What will be interesting is to see the change next month. Maybe at the end of the year on December 20th and I can make a cool little graph.

Do you use these tools? What other tools do you use to measure blog performance?
