title: Statistics in Forecasting - A project summary
---
This is an abstract of my research project done during the brilliant Tianxia Research Mentorship. It revolves around forecasting and the potential usage of statistical model in this cause area(since I major in this). 

# Introduction
Most of the important questions answered by forecasters are still done manually. 

* This is **time-consuming and inefficient**

* This may also lead to **subjective** decisions since personal judgements are made frequently on when and how to adjust the probability. 

There are certain constraints due to the scalability and accessibility to useful datasets. In general, automated forecasting can be positive. However, due to the limited spending on forecasters and a "forecasting market", automation is not realistic at this stage. This project serves as an early-stage discovery to the possibility of following a quantative/statistical approach while at the same time adopt the conventional reference class method(or in another word, **interactive** machine model taking input from human forecasters). A further question of interest but may not be solvable currently is whether these models can outperform human forecasters(as stated in Superforecasting, superforecasters already beat experts in Math, Stat and other fields). 
# Significance
I have done some literature review in this field but little information are found. One important project is conducted by the USA Intelligence Agency, about which few information are available and from which we can see that their models are still based the rudimentary simple average of human and machine predictions instead of an interactive one. But they did mention a hybrid forecasting model. More information available [**here**](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/hfc).

# Conclusion

In this writeup, we mainly focuses on the usage of both simple and sophisticated statistical models with conventional assumptions in forecasting some social and political events. A few conclusion draw are summarized below.

1. These models can be unbiased from individual subjective opinions. For example, when setting up the model after obtaining the data, it is hard to bring in one's irrational personal believes. However, on the other hand, if one has in-depth understanding of a problem, it may be difficult to embed it in the model as well. Some possible solutions involves: Personalized input, Bayesian model and Simple average of one's belief and the model's output. 
2. The model based on the gradual evolution of human society and technological advance(or the breakthrough model) has certain practical usage and may be used in the forecasting of geopolitical events. However, further work needs to be done so that the "exponential growth" of technology can be better captured. Nevertheless, I personally believe a exponential model might overstate our progress in the long run, meaning that a conventional model is good enough if we are on a centennial or even millennial scale. For other rare events(such as invention of nuclear bomb) that appears to pop out from nowhere, it is extremely hard to predict using any models and a common solution is to use Bayesian thinking and add one's personal belief. 
3. One useful property of this statistical approach is that we actually can personalize easily. For example, different input parameter stands for unique believes(as shown in previous analysis). It is much more convenient if we want to take an average from a wide range of "believes". One possible extension of this is that we can gather believes from a crowd of people and plug them into the model. This can give also us a distribution of predictions, helping us understand how uncertain this question is and what is a typical belief.
