We had three great speakers from Kong, Lightstep, and Harness joining us at our September Cloud Native London meetup at esynergy. We also had virtual attendees joining us via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), [Lightstep](https://lightstep.com/), and [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was  Viktor Gamov from Kong with a great discussion on how to Supercharge your Kubernetes Ingress (starting at [24:25](https://youtu.be/En88atN_VgI?t=1465)). He talked about:

* The purpose and limitation of Kubernetes Ingress
* How Kong custom open source resources allow you to expose gRPC, TCP and UPD services
* How a new Gateway API will address Ingress limitations

Next up we had Dimitris Finas from Lightstep who described New observability with OpenTelemetry & Distributed Traces (starting at [1:01:01](https://youtu.be/En88atN_VgI?t=3661)). His takeaways mentioned how: 

* You should look at OpenTelemetry to collect all your traces, metrics and logs in vendor agnostic way
* Distributed traces is the best way to do root cause analysis (RCA) for micro-services
* In DevOps world, the best observability solution should be intuitive to be used by anyone

Finally we had Jaap Brasser from Harness wrapping up our evening with a talk on Chaos Engineering Implementations Demystified (starting at [1:48:07](https://youtu.be/En88atN_VgI?t=6487)). His takeaways discussed: 

* What is Chaos Engineering
* Testing your code in production
* Best practices of Chaos Engineering

And of course, our usual group photo!
