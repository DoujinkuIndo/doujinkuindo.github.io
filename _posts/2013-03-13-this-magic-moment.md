# This Magic Moment — The Mountain Goats

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtxsS_Jfww4 One of the things I like most about oldies — R+B, soul, motown hits from the 1950s and 60s — is that they're unquantifiable. It's hard to explain why they've stuck with us for so long. Songs from the 1970s are dated as 70s songs, dismissed as disco or free jazz; songs from the 1940s are dated as standards; Sinatra, pre-rock'n'roll, and the end of classic Jazz. But the oldies are still somehow relevant; they influence the timbre, tone, and content of modern music in an unusual way. Maybe it's a sliding scale, and in ten years we'll be influenced by the 1970s, but I doubt it. Something about how music was written and produced in the 1950s and 60s was special; still holds value. _This Magic Moment_ was originally by [Ben E. King and The Drifters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul041CSNJto); most people know the song and its tune; less know the name; nobody knows who wrote it. But it's somewhere in the popular consciousness, along with _A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte _and perhaps _The Canterbury Tales_: it's outlived its era and it's hard to say why.
