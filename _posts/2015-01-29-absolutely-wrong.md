What a crazy year 2014 was! Holy cow! Unless you were hiding under a rock for most of it, you're probably already (at least mildly) aware of quite a few developments both domestic and abroad. Let me just list out a few highlights:

- Ferguson, MO and the ensuing nationwide discourse\
- A bunch of celebs had their iCloud nude-selfies stolen and distributed (the Fappening)
- ISIS is a thing now, and they're terrifying
- Boko Haram is ravaging Africa, and if the media gave two shits - they'd be even more terrifying
- The tech industry has a gender problem...or at least the SF tech industry does
- Republicans took both the Senate and the House in the recent midterms
- President Obama laid out some ambitious plans in response to his party's miserable showing in said midterms
- the list could go on...

Just...wow.
