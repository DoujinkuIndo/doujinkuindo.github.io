![Hour of Code](http://miriamtocino.github.io/images/posts/hour-of-code.svg)

My mother works as a teacher at an elementary school in Spain. Last week she asked me about some online resources where her 10 years-old students could learn to code during their summer break. I collected some of them, mostly recommended by my colleagues at work. Her students are Spanish and that's why you will see information about which one is also offered in this language, apart from English ☺.

She also wanted to inspire her students by showing them everything what you can do if you learn to code. For that I recommended her [the following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN02q2wen50), which presents all kinds of people working in different industries and makes it easier for children to get identified by someone among them.
