# Echo — Foxes (FIXYN remix)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aemEQYNZkyY This sort of music — it's remix music, certainly, processed into next week, built up from real voices and instruments, a history of record scratching and repurposing, distorted until nothing is recognizable but the true music theory behind the music — contrapuntal motion, syncopation, dynamics and style, without the pesky instrumentation that live music demands. Cheating? Maybe. But also far more freeing, with time to dote over every smidge, time enough to process and mix and create rhythms that weave in and out of real music. I don't care about the culture around it or the context or even the song itself, but the sorts of people who create this music are praiseworthy, innovative, the musical equivalent of academics, so caught up in music that they can't help but take new tracks and really _think_ about_ _them.
