![45 ARTIST](/images/dc45.jpg)

Art can take us out of one world and into another. It can uncover parts of ourselves we didn't know existed. That is the beauty of the master artist. He had to go to this other world alone first. Art is the expression of a mind that has journeyed across boundaries, and survived, only to return to tell the tale. It's not about what the artist sees, but what they make others see.
