As a recent convert to the Mac OS X platform (I bought a Mac Book Pro), I'm loving OmniOutliner for creating outlines and documents, with one small annoyance. The default keyboard shortcut isn't easy enough for me to use to move items up and down the outline list.

So when I found this article 
[Alternative Options and Shorter Shortcuts](http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/alternative-options-and-shorter-shortcuts) I saw that using the same method I'd be able to 're-map' ⌘↑ and ⌘↓ to move items up and down the list. And it's worked. ☺
