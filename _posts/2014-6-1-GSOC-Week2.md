title: MLPack - Improvement of Automatic Benchmarking System - Week-2
category: binary
---

And the end of week two! More coding and more fun this week. The following additions were made to the benchmarking system:

1. The following metrics implementations:
    
    * Matthews correlation coefficient
    * Mean squared error
    * Mean predictive information

2. I also added unit tests for the implemented metrics.

Currently, I am working on the class conversion problem. More on this in the next week's post!

Thanks a lot for visiting! Feel free to reach me out if you have any questions regarding the project. I will be happy to help!
