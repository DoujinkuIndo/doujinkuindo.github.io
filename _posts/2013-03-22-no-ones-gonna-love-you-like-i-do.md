# No One's Gonna Love You — Cee-Lo Green

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzAof7HjaxU Band of Horses remains mostly unknown to me. This happens, more than I'd like — I'll tangentially know about a band, but there won't be that little kick of incentive for me to research them; and, with no reason, it'll sit in my blind spot for months, years. I heard _[Is There A Ghost_ ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JXJidkZ81o)in Fringe a few months back, and (oh god, the spoilers) it fit perfectly: so perfectly that I went and found that I even _had_ some Band of Horses in my library, and it still wasn't enough to get into them properly. So there's the original [No One's Gonna Love You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuZo7pLnL7c) by Band of Horses, and then there's the cover. And he brings out a strange, dramatic, vindictive twist in the song which — well, listen to it for yourself. But it also loses some subtlety. But Cee-Lo can't help it. If whiny emotional folk is the undercurrent of Band of Horses, then outright glee and cruelty are the undercurrents of this cover. It takes a note from _[Fuck You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGr3cBuM8Zw)._ It'd be hard not to, with context. Still, the song was about being complacent and resigned in a relationship; it becomes something much more intentioned. I like it, but it's very different.
