**1-800 Dinosaur** is the label for **James Blake**’s SoundCloud channel, where he posts surreal, atonal, remixes of popular songs. Here we have **Destiny’s Child**‘s _Bills Bills Bills_ auto-tuned into oblivion, removing the delicious harmonies that made the song so appealing in the first place, but replacing them with a ridiculous polyrhythmic beat, a 5/4 clave over double bass.

James Blake, a British producer/singer-singwriter famous for his Mercury prize-winning folk/jazz/electronica work, shrouds himself in mystery.

_The Wilhelm Scream_ is distinctly electronica with its production, but with gorgeous, layered, gospel vocals, produced with such precision that it’s difficult to know what his real voice sounds like: any particular affectation could be a subtle tweak or a magnificent vocal ability. Then you have [_Overgrown_](\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlaRjP8pg0Q\") and [_Retrograde_](\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p6PcFFUm5I\"), a duet of sensitive electronica-R&B songs for the bedroom set. All pretty much in line with his image as a sensitive young man from London, bottled up in his bedroom studio, expressing himself through dainty riffs and dope-ass beats.

Then you have _Lindisfarne._

If _Retrograde_ is the logical next step after **The Smiths** (sensitive, emotional, happy-sad), _Lindisfarne_is the logical next step after **Nick Drake**: named for a 6th century AD center of Celtic Christianity, its pastoral music and folk samples paint an emotionally resonant picture, one more resistant to interpretation than the simple **XX**-like love-lost themes of his earlier work.

Then, back to the top, you have **Bills**. This completes our picture of the artist: not a man struggling to express himself through the medium of electronica, but a competent producer experimenting in genre, style, and range.

And then he goes and collaborates with **RZA**, teasing a passionate love song from the former **Wu-Tang** frontman. What a god-damn champion.
