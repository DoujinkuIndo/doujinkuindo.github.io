# Bye Bye Bye — Plants and Animals

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSE6dSz3uLI First semester, I pulled a series of late night stints in Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, staying up into the early hours to work on my ME 170 homework, a computer-aided design course which required the usage of any number of computer labs, all of which were across campus from my dorm. So I would have a big dinner, get my headphones, and go work. It was tedious. I like the theory behind it, but in execution it was mindless, mechanical work, requiring — at most — the mental capacity required to pick up and rotate an object, or use a ruler. So I sat in a dark, empty computer lab at 2am, doing homework, listening to a bunch of new albums. One of them was the album this song was from. Another irreversible link of music and time/place.
