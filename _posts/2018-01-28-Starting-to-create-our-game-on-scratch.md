    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked if we could change our game as it was too detailed but apart from that i understood our task</td>

    <td>Independence</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I really looked forward to creating my very own game on scratch</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could have got all the sprites and backgrounds first during the lesson instead of getting a sprite and coding it</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think i should next time think of an easier game as it would be hard to code my game and also i mght need to collect all the sprites and create all backgrounds then code them.</td>
