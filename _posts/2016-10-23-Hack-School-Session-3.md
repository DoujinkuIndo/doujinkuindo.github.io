title: Hack School Session 3
---

Thanks for braving midterms and still making it out to our third Hack School session!
JavaScript, Node, and servers are all really tough topics. Feel free to [read up](http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html) more on your own, as this will certainly benefit you.

There's plenty of tutorials out there but it might be overwhelming. Feel free to drop into ACM's Clubhouse and ask for help!

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xi02MMjSkIHnNVFS3ZRnB4rPWqmo6VNCHwH0hpNn0EQ/edit?usp=sharing)

This blog post will be updated with full information soon.
