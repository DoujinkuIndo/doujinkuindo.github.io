Which research methods do you most want to learn?
- I want to learn more about utilizing meta-analysis because it uses comparative studies to evaluate different results towards the same goal. A basic example of using meta-analysis in my life is following professional football and basketball. As a fan, I often read through different articles of the same athlete or team to develop my own opinions about them. This helps me broaden my knowledge about the sport and strengthen my involvement with it. Moreover, not only will I use meta-analysis in sports, but in my college major as well. As an aspiring Biomedical Engineer, I will have the opportunity to participate in a number of research and development projects during my time here at IIT. Thus, learning and mastering meta-analysis will enhance my skills as an engineer and make me a solid contributor during class and research. 

What topics in digital humanities research interest you?
- Media studies, specifically, how the use of digital and social media across various platforms has heavily influenced how society shares their opinion across the community. Today, popular social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram all communicate to the public on one's experiences, actions and opinions. With that, I want to learn more about how our community has changed from the traditional ink and paper, to on-line based reporting.

Which digital literacy do you most want to master?
- Analyzing and reflecting, because as a learner I want to get the most out of my experiences and studies.  I see analyzing as a fundamental skill to master, as it is often used to study or restructure various written works. On the other hand, I think reflection is also an important skill to have, because it helps form opinion and discussion. Lastly, mastering these will help me utilize my knowledge in real life situations such as graduate studies, internships and research.
