The City of Dayton is [asking is residents and workers for another 0.25%](http://www.daytonwater.org/674/Issue-9) of their income this November. Currently the rate is 2.25% - one of the highest in Ohio - so, if the tax is passed, the rate would climb to 2.5%.

Dayton voters will see the following wording for what is Issue 9 on their ballot this November (or on their absentee ballot):

> Shall the ordinace providing for a one-quarter of one percent (1/4%) levy increase on income for the period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2024 for essential municipal services and necessary capital improvements generally, and to the extent revenue from the tax is available for pre-kindergarten education for the residents of the City, and the proposed amendment to the Dayton City Charter enacting Section 189 authorizing the City Commission to impose an additional levy of one-quarter of one percent (1/4%) on income from January 1, 2017 until December 31, 2024 for the same purposes be passed?

How much will this cost the average worker? It's pretty simple math, but here's a couple quotes from various sources:

> The Â¼% would result in an average investment of $1.60 per week for someone earning $35,000 a year. 

## [WDTN 2 News](http://wdtn.com/2016/07/13/dayton-income-tax-increase-to-be-on-november-ballot/)

> For someone working in Dayton and earning about $35,000, it would mean paying an extra $1.60 cents per week or about $83 dollars per year in taxes. 

Let's do the math. Assume there's exactly 52 weeks a year (actually it's a week and a day in non-leap years). That means it will cost someone who makes what they said [0.25% * $35,000 / 52 = $1.68](https://www.google.com/search?q=0.25%25+*+%2435%2C000+%2F+52). That's a little over 8&cent; (because of rounding) more than what was claimed.

Now let's figure it out for the entire year. [Just don't divide by 52 and you get $87.50](https://www.google.com/search?q=0.25%25+*+%2435%2C000). That's four and a half bucks more than what was claimed.

So, are they trying to lie how much the tax will cost, or can they just not do simple math? Either way, would you trust them with your money?

Use the following table to calculate how much the tax could cost you:
