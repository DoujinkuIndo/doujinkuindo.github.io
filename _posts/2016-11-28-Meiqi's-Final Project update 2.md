This is the second and will be the final posts. This is a heavy study for me. Not only because I am an Asian and I'm not one of white people, but I have to face the problem that other races and ethinicties have the same unfair situation; and this kind of situation has been existing so long in the history, the unequalness has started since the American War of Independence. The more I dig into this study, the more heavy I feel - the whole history, not only in the job market, but also the unequalness happended in this land.
