Larry Salibra has a post on [how to move notes from Evernote to Apple iCloud Notes](https://www.larrysalibra.com/evernote-to-apple-notes/).

His Applescript does a fantastic job of this, the only issue I had was that my iCloud account was named differently to 'iCloud', all I did to resolve that was to rename my account in Apple Preferences > Accounts back to iCloud while I did the export.

Found this via [ipadinsight.com](http://ipadinsight.com/ipad-tips-tricks/how-to-transfer-your-notes-from-evernote-to-apple-notes/).

Now I'm [as happy as Larry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Foley) :)
