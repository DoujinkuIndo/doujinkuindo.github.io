# Kid for Today — Boards of Canada

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=65J9JTlsTfE I'm always mystified by the timbres of this song. They're all so subdued, so ephemeral that none of them sticks out squarely, and yet there's something emergent when they all combine; it's hard for me not to get chills at the 5:01 when the cycle of the song blooms into something more sudden and intense. It's by all means a simple piece, one that I can listen to in almost every situation and feel like it "fits": long drives, late night walks, sitting in bed staring at the ceiling, consorting with friends, whatever. It's the beauty of songs without lyrics, with less-clearly defined themes and sentiments - one can attach their own meanings and memories to it and make it "theirs" in an individual way. Boards nails these kinds of songs, with blurry synths and drums that seem more organic than electronic. If I had to take a stab at the ever-slippery question of what this song is "about", I'd probably point to the title; it's about slowing things down, making things simple, being a kid again for the day. And maybe that's why I find it so germane to everything I do, and why I feel like it's a song almost anyone could connect to: everyone was a child once, everyone had a time where things were simpler.
