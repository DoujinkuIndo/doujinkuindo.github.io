# Lakeside View Apartments Suite — The Mountain Goats

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXKbZUmu1W0 The Mountain Goats — John Darnielle, really — in all his resplendent drug-haven gospel-soul-searching dysfunctional-family-drama glory, is either slow and delicate and composed, or totally wild, gone, unbent, and free. So this song was a brilliant change of pace — when the drum kicks in at the 1:05 mark, it gives the song manic, desperate 4:4 energy, with a calm melody and a calm vocal, and it was, on first impact, simply wonderful — possibly the poppiest song I've ever heard them do. So excellent.
