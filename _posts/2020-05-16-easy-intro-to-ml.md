# Machine Learning for Mother-in-Laws

## About This Blog

This blog is part 1 of a 3-part series on Machine Learning, explained as you would to your mother-in-law at dinner. **Disclaimer:** *This is not intended to be a slight against mother-in-laws!* Quite the opposite: "Mother-in-law" in this sense just means "someone who is interested, but also scared by the big words and math symbols on the Wikipedia page". If that sounds like you, and you want to know what Elon Musk is talking about when he mentions "machine learning", then look no further.


This blog will cover the following topics:

1. What is Machine Learning

2. Why it is Important

The technique that this blog will follow is 2-step: (1) Lay out the general idea with with an example of something relatable, and (2) delve into the details using abtraction, images, and analagies  whenever possible. No analagy is perfect, but in this context, they won't have to be, they just have to point your brain in the right direction.

In essence, if you have lived, and worked, and tried things (and failed), and explored, and asked questions, then you already have all the tools you need to understand machine learning.

## Background

I had the idea to make this blog about a year ago, when my own mother-in-law asked:

>So, what is 'IT', again?

I was surprised by how hard it was to explain IT (Information Technology) in a way that was relatable, and found that the same problem applies to almost any topic that is technology-related. So many ideas pop into people's minds when you mention things like "computers" or "programs", and most of those ideas are not accurate because they are largely based on how mainstream media has portrayed them. This has serious implications, in my opinion, beacuse it leads to "magic box thinking" where anything we don't understand is just considered to be 'magic', and we don't bothering to try and understand what is really going on under the hood. The problem with this mindset is that it doesn't leave room for critical thinking, and can become a slippery slope into conspiracy theories, especially when talking about technlology.

The other problem is people who consider themselves to be "teckies" and pride themselves on the fact that they understand things that other people don't. Technology is about filling human needs and solving problems, and as "IT" we should not alientate the people who are trying to learn more about what we do.

So enough rambling, lets jump in.


## What is Machine Learning

If you were to bring up *machine learning* at a party with friends, you would probably get mixed reactions: peaked interest, blank stares, eye-rolling, and people suddenly remembering that they left their car running. Machine Learning is a trending topic that is often brought up, but is not widely understood by the average person. The offical defenintion from Wikipedia is

> [...] the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.

If you don't have programming experince some of that may seem scary, so let's start by taking a deep breath, and empting our proverbial tea cup.

Let me start with a story.

The year is 1994, and with the birth of the Internet a few years ago, websites are really starting to take off [https://www.smamarketing.net/blog/the-history-of-website-design]. Being the tech-savvy entrepenuer you are, you want to get an early foot in the door and start building websites for big companies. You predict (correctly) that eventually every business would have a website, but the early adapters would have an advantag and start pitching your case for a webiste: [http://www.lazyboy.com]. You can only imagine the reactions:  "Why would I need a website?" you might be asked. "I have a listing in YellowPages!" (Incidentally, lazyboy's website was launched in 1998 [https://web.archive.org/web/19980501000000*/http://lazyboy.com].)

Today it is obvious to see the importance websites, and how inadequate it would be to compare one to a simple tool like a phonebook. The idea of websites is not exciting today; (almost) every business has one, and their functionality is as versatile as the imagination of the person building it. Applications, eCommerce, Social Media, blogs, and almost any kind of service imaginable are all available directly from the internet. This is what you need to get through to a business owner who may think that thier company has "nothing to do with technology" and is just fine doing things they same way they have always been done. 

The same problem arises today with machine learning. We are at the point where it is starting to be utilized by businesses, but not everyone understands how to apply it and it's benefits.
