# Machine Learning for Mother-in-Laws

## About This Blog

This blog is part 1 of a 3-part series on Machine Learning, explained in a way that is approachable, and does not alienate those people who might be a bit afraid of complicated technology. In essense, it describes what machine learning is, as you would to your mother-in-law at dinner. **Disclaimer:** *This is not intended to be a slight against mother-in-laws!* Quite the opposite: "Mother-in-law" in this sense can just as well mean "someone who is interested, but also easily scared by computer terms and weird-looking math symbols". If that sounds like you, and you want to know more about machine learning, then you've come to the right place.

This blog is split into two parts:

1. What is Machine Learning
2. Why it's Important

After reading through this blog, you will have a good idea of what machine learning is, and will be able to relate the core concepts to examples from your everyday life. Lets Go!

## What is Machine Learning

If you were to bring up *machine learning* at a party today, you would probably get some mixed reactions: peaked interest, blank stares, eye-rolling, and people suddenly remembering that they left their car running. Machine learning is a hot topic in business and information technology, but it comes with a lot of misconceptions. It is often brought up in discussions about artificial intelligence, big data, and often serves as a conversation-killer because it is really not understood by the average person who just wants to get back to enjoying the cheese tray. So, what is all the fuzz about?

If you Google "machine learning" today, you would see that the definition on Wikipedia is:

> **"[...] the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience."**
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning]

Now, if you don't have much experience with computers, that sentence alone may be enough to scare you away. That's why I'm here: to break it down, and make it easy to understand. Who knows, it might even be fun!

### Computer Algorithms

Without using yet another Wikipedia definition (which can turn into endlessly looking up definitions), *Computer algorithms* are the instructions that computers follow to complete tasks. Algorithms on their own are just step-by-step instructions. They are like the driving directions you would give to a friend to reach your house. It would probably include satements like:

+ "Turn left at main street"
+ "If you see a 7-11, you've gone too far"
+ "Keep going until the end of the block"

Computer algorithms are much the same. They are simply the instructions for computers to follow for completing tasks like making calculations, running apps, and much, much more. The way that computers can 'read' algorithms is because they are written in a language that computers can interpret, and are called programs.

Summed up: Computer algorithms are the step-by-step instrcutions that computers use to complete tasks.

### Algorithms that Improve through Experience

Machine learning algorithms are special in that they are made to make computers 'learn' and become better at their tasks. The need for this arose from human jobs that typically had too much data to work with, but can also be applied to many toher things, including self-driving cars. 

How do they learn? They are fed large amounts of data which they analyze for patterns. Those patterns are then used to make predictions about more data of the same kind. The data being fed into the algorithm is called 'imput' and the prediction it makes is called an 'output'.

There are three main machine learning methods:

1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised
3. Reinforcement

**Supervised learning** is when the algorithm is given labelled examples to compare against while looking for patterns. This is like giving a child the job of sorting Legos by color, with each bin having a big picture of the color that goes in it. After sorting though enough lego, the child would be able to sort new Lego into new, unmarked bins, by using what they learned about colors.

**Unsupervised learning** is when the algorithm is given no example to compare with, and must make its own generalizations. This is often used when looking for new, previously unseen patterns in data. This is like telling a 10 year old to "sort the lego" but not telling them how. Later, you can look at the unique criteria that the 10 year old came up with to do the sorting.

**Reinforcement learning** is a method that provides immediate feedback to the algorithm in the form of "rewards", which the algorithm tries to maximize. In practice, this would be like putting a kid in a room with buckets and lego, but not telling them why they are there. If they put a lego in the right bucket, you reward them with a candy. 

That completes the first section of this blog. We have covered what machine learning is, and to give it some context, I'll talk about how it's used by businesses today, and why it is so useful.

# Why it's Important

Machine learning is as important to businesses today as websites were in the '90s. Not everyone could see the application of websites, and it was the early adapters that got ahead of the competition. Today you can still run a business without a website, but it puts you at a serious disadvantage. So, how does this compare to machine learning?

The companies today that employ machine learning have one thing in commmon: they all process a lot of data. And by a lot I mean an almost incomprehensible amount of data. That is part of the requirements for using machine learning.
