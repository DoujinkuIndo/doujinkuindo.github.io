![50 FLOW](/images/dc50.jpg)

Flow is the state of optimal consciousness where the purest work is born. You enter this state by becoming so immersed in the present that everything else fades- Action merges with awareness and time slows. The part of your brain that controls self-editing goes dim and you become like water, strengthened by a softness that allows you to bend, change, and adapt on the fly. You lose yourself to the moment and in the process find your true potential. You let yourself go, and yet as a result, you return stronger.
