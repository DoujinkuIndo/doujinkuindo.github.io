# Patterns

There are different patterns that games use to keep the player playing. These patterns can be grouped in four categories:
- Come and play
- Bring your friends
- Come back soon
- Stay together

We have implemented different patterns that fall into these categories.

## Come and Play

To help the player get to know the game and learn him the basic mechanics, there is a tutorial in the game. During this you will learn how you can upgrade you character, move around the world and learn the restictions of you abilities.
F.e. in the beginning you are too weak to push an object. Later on you will be stronger and can accomplish such tasks.

The tutorial is designed to present the player an open world but the player will most likely follow a (more or less) given path through the tutorial.

## Bring your Friends

Since this game is a singleplayer game there is no direct call to action to bring in a friend. To get new player we are hoping for mouth to mouth propaganda and you tell your friend that this game is awesome!

## Come Back Soon

A difficult task is to bring the player back to the game.
We challenge this task to with our puzzles and our open world. Since we the puzzles are challenging the player will want to solve them. If he cannot do it the completionist in the player will rbing him back to finish the puzzle.

The open world helps with this effect since the player can look at level he cannot do yet. This shows the player that he needs to come back to solve a different level if he wants to try the level he is looking at.

## Stay Forever

The patterns for coming back also aim to keep you playing in the first place. The puzzles are brain teasers that give a good feeling when you solve them. This feeling is multiplied by the achievements that the player can get. He will be rewardes with these when he does certain actions.

There could also be a screen that displays the achievements you dont have yet. A completionist will want to get all of them.
