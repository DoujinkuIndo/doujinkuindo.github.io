Two great speakers from Palo Alto Networks and Helio AG joined us at our September Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Netapp](https://www.netapp.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

## Overview

Our first speaker was David Okeyode from Palo Alto Networks kicking us off for the evening with a talk about How attackers exploit containerized Azure workloads - and how to secure them (starting at [27:25](https://youtu.be/R1OjzCjhcEw?t=1645)). His takeaways were about:

* Container security threat landscape for Azure.
* Tactics that attackers use to exploit containerized workloads.
* Practical techniques to limit the likelihood of a successful breach.

Then Christoph Buchli from Helio AG wrapped up our evening by discussing Sustainability, powered by Argo (starting at [1:00:40](https://youtu.be/R1OjzCjhcEw?t=3640)). He explained that: 

* Demand Flexibility is key for a sustainable future of Cloud.
* The environmental footprint of the compute-intensive future can be significantly reduced through intelligent Scheduling and Deployment.
* Cloud Native Technologies, especially argo, make sustainable computing possible.

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
