# Why? — Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqh6ftYehTQ During my freshman orientation at college, an older friend who I knew from high school scooped me up and dragged me me to a blues dance. I had no idea what a blues dance was, and to this day I know not how to explain it to the uninitiated. The best approximation I can offer is; "It's what you probably thought of as "going dancing" when you were a kid, except to blues music." There are some standard moves, and it's essential that partners share weight and balance each other, but aside from that, anything goes in blues dance, as long as you don't drop your partner or hit them in the eye. (Both have happened to me. Advice: booze and blues don't mix if you don't know what you're doing or lose your sense of depth perception when drunk.) For my first few dances, I was both clueless and terrified that I'd be laughed at. I don't know when I "got it." I don't remember there being a moment where it suddenly clicked, but sometimes around November, I was dancing -- not just mimicking dancing, but starting to dance for myself. I went to the weekly dances, summoned up the courage to ask strangers to dance, and tried to learn as much as I could. Around the same time, I found "Why?" Like the moment when I moved from completely not understanding blues dance to being able to hold my own on the floor, I don't remember when I found this song, where I was, or on what assignment I was procrastinating. However, I do remember thinking very clearly, "If I could blues dance to one song, it would be this one." Listening to The_ Swimming Hour_ as an album is like following a good partner.  Andrew Bird throws down moves one after the other, and I was not quite knowing where the next one would come from or what it would be, but I was sure that I wouldn't get dropped or poked in the eye. "Two Way Action" is pure rock and roll, "Fatal Flower Garden" a mournful waltz, "Too Long" nearly straight '20s jazz, "Core and Rind" almost parodic surf rock. But, of all those moves, it is the sinuous "Why?" that I always look forward to the most. "Why?" was a promise, of a hidden world on the fringes of Oberlin, where an awkward girl who had always gone by the motto "I can't dance" could evolve, Pokemon-style, into something completely different. I helped organize blues dances over Winter Term, when Oberlin was sparsely populated due to the majority of students pursuing projects off campus. A DJ was needed last-minute, and I impulsively volunteered. "Why?" was the first song I added to the playlist. I made some questionable choices on some (most) of the other songs, and looking back on my sets from Winter Term, the overwhelming theme is _What was I THINKING?_ "Why?", however, remains a mainstay of my blues sets to this day.
