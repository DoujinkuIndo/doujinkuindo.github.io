# Thriller — Imogen Heap

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrIBCwyk80 There is only so much praise I can lavish on an artist, but Imogen deserves all of it — her music is controlled, tasteful, graceful, well-composed and well-arranged, like all good electronica — her vocals are perfect, processed and trying far harder than she needs to. She has an amazing voice and an amazing sense of rhythm and tone without even the computer in between us. And her normal work — she is most famous for _Hide and Seek_, processed within an inch of its life. But this, an MJ cover, is pure — nearly entirely her real voice and piano, and it's gorgeous and perfect and I cannot get enough of it.
