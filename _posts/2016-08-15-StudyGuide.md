*Planning and verifying tool for all the requirements of your studies*

As part of a two semester Java course last year, I designed and implemented a simple [JavaFX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX) desktop app for keeping your studies on track.

![StudyGuide Screenshot](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/oskopek/StudyGuide/master/docs/img/screenshot.png)

It can import data from SIS, an integrated school information system that [my university](http://cuni.cz) uses, but you can also enter your course data yourself:
either manually in the app, or create a valid JSON (see [README](https://github.com/oskopek/StudyGuide/blob/master/README.adoc) on how to do that) and import it.

The app will verify any constraints you place want to check your study plan for (minimum credit number, etc.). Give it [a try now](https://github.com/oskopek/StudyGuide/)!

If you encounter any issue or have question, feel free to [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/oskopek/StudyGuide/issues/new).

Happy ~~studying~~ planning!
