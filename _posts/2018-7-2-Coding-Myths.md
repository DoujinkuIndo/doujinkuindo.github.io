No, we are not coding a myth. These are 10 myths about coding you should not believe! 

Are you interested in learning coding or web development? Do you keep finding yourself doubting if it is the right path for you? If this sounds familiar, read on. In this post, we will take a look at some of the most common coding myths to help you get over your doubts and start learning right away.

The world of tech and coding is filled with rumors and misconceptions. You might be pondering over questions like:

- Do I need to be good at math?
- Am I too old for learning coding?
- Will I only be successful once I create the next Facebook or Twitter?

The bottom line is that anyone and everyone can learn how to code – **regardless of their skills or who they are.**

You don’t need to have great ideas or a master plan to create the next big tech startup. Just have fun with it, stay motivated, and maintain your confidence in yourself and in what you do.

Learning programming has never been easier than today. Not to mention that skilled developers are one of the most sought-after employees in the world right now.

So, stop worrying about not being good enough or not succeeding right away. Instead, use your time more wisely and start learning coding today!

## 1. I NEED TO BE GOOD AT MATH TO LEARN CODING

This misconception is something I hear a lot, so let’s take care of it first.

When it comes to math skills for learning coding, you will need some basic calculus and algebra to understand the fundamentals of how computers work and what coding is about. However, you will not be working with any advanced-level math concepts in the future if you are interested in web development.

What really matters in programming and web development is the ability to approach problems in structured, creative ways and to solve them efficiently. Hence, you will need skills in logical thinking and plenty of patience and perseverance to keep you going.

And if you are not that good in solving problems yet, don’t worry. You will learn how to approach even the most complex of problems very quickly when you start learning coding.

*Myth #1 busted!*

## 2. I’M TOO OLD TO START LEARNING CODING

It does not matter whether you are 20, 40, or 60. Anyone and everyone can learn how to code.

With coding, your age simply does not matter. What matters more is how much work you are willing to put into learning the things you are interested in.

Instead of seeing it as a negative, make your age, expertise, and wisdom into an advantage! Having 10 or 20 years of experience in a specific industry is something money just can’t buy. That experience is your #1 asset that you can amp up with some new skills in programming.

And don’t forget your network of contacts that you have created over the years!

Of course, age brings about some challenges when it comes to learning new things. However, if you really enjoy learning programming, that is all that matters. Having passion and confidence is much more powerful than simply having been born yesterday.

Just have fun with it, it is never too late to start learning!

## 3. CODING IS FOR NERDS

Wrong!

Coding is for everyone!

You do not have to worry about being overrun by nerds and LARPing foam sword fighters when you start your amazing journey into the wonderful world of coding.

The community around coding is incredibly welcoming and supporting. You will find plenty of like-minded people to connect with. Additionally, it is easy to meet people outside of your “social comfort zone”, finding common ground in topics around programming and tech sooner than you think.

So, it is time to get rid of thinking about stereotypes. Stop making silly excuses and start using your time for something more sensible. What could that be?

------

## 4. I NEED TO BE REALLY SMART TO LEARN PROGRAMMING

what matters the most is your drive, motivation, and hard work!

Anyone can learn how to code. Anyone. You simply need to be consistent, have a good plan for getting where you want to be, and then just do the necessary work step by step.

And remember: the more you practice, the easier things will become.

So, just start and see what happens. You can advance at your own pace, focus on what you find interesting, and just have fun with it. You have nothing to lose!

## 5. I NEED A COLLEGE DEGREE TO START A CAREER IN PROGRAMMING

There are not nearly as many developers out there with a college or university degree as you might think.

If you are interested in learning programming, you will not get far with learning just the theory by listening to a lecture. What you need is practice. A lot of it.

First, know what you want to build or create with coding. After that, start learning the tools you need to achieve that. The best way to learn how to code is to work on practical, real-world projects and write programs and code from scratch.

In short, a college degree is nice to have but it does not mean you can build and manage coding projects of your own. I have not met one single employer who is more interested in someone with a degree than in someone who has an awesome portfolio that speaks for itself.

## 6. I ONLY NEED TO LEARN ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE – THE BEST ONE

Learning one programming language is a good start. However, in most cases it is not enough to start a career in tech, for example.

Any programming language is simply a means to an end: it is a tool to help you achieve something. Each programming language fits a specific purpose, either for work or study.

In other words, there is no one programming language that is the best of them all. There are only programming languages that are more suitable for a specific purpose than others.

If you are interested in front-end web development, you will learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – at the very least. As a backend developer, you will need to learn Python, PHP, Ruby, or Java, for instance.

In short, be prepared to learn more than just one programming language. Moreover, no single language is superior to others per se. It is rather a matter of suitability and preference.

## 7. IT WILL TAKE YEARS BEFORE I CAN START EARNING MONEY WITH CODING

Knowing how to code is like a superpower. But let’s face it: nobody gets superpowers overnight. You can learn the basics of coding and any programming language in weeks, but it takes years to really become an expert. However, this should not stop you from getting your first coding gigs surprisingly quickly.

> **The time it takes for you to acquire sufficient skills in coding to start a career depends only on your motivation and persistence.**

Before you start learning programming, have a clear idea about what it is you wish to achieve or create with coding. With a clear goal in mind, you can be ready for an entry-level developer job in just six months – assuming you stay motivated and focused.

I became interested in learning programming almost by accident at my QBasic classes. I started to learn coding by myself simply because I quickly noticed how much fun it was!

## 8. LEARNING CODING IS EXPENSIVE

This is one of the most common coding myths I keep hearing. Luckily, you can easily find all the resources you need to learn coding for free these days. That’s right – you do not need to spend a single dollar in order to learn how to code.

When you are a total beginner in the world of coding and web development, it makes sense to start out by using all the free resources available online. That way you can see what you like the most and which area of programming you would like to focus on in the future.

After that, you can check out [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and their [HTML and CSS courses](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css). That will give you an understanding of the very basics of web development.

## 9. I WILL BE LONELY AS A DEVELOPER

More than anything, coding is teamwork. A career as a developer is actually a very social one. While working on projects either in your team or by yourself, you will often exchange thoughts and ideas with others.

Especially if you end up working at a bigger company, I can guarantee that you will not be lacking social interaction if that is important to you.

Surely you will spend a good amount of your time solving problems and doing some intense thinking by yourself. However, when the road gets rocky, there is no better place to go to than the loving arms of the supportive community of your fellow coders and developers.

## 10. I NEED A GREAT IDEA TO START LEARNING PROGRAMMING

Learning how to code is a long process. It is going to be filled with ups, downs, and anything in between. Having a great idea for a project is a good thing to have, of course. However, what is more important is that you feel a genuine interest in what you are doing.

And what is a great idea anyways? Is my idea better than yours? Of course not. Ideas translate into plans. Plans translate into projects. And projects should translate into incentives and motivation. When you find your motivation, make sure you take good care of it!

Instead of trying to build the next Facebook or YouTube, try to find an idea that translates into a solution to a problem you’ve personally faced. Are you working with Excel? Great! Perhaps you can automate a process you spend time on regularly.

Have a plan, set yourself realistic targets, and track your progress. These simple steps will keep you on the right track – even when you feel like your ideas are not good enough. **All ideas are good enough!**
