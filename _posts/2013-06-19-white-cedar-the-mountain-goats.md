# White Cedar — The Mountain Goats

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQGg58ixXjE 2:00. Don't skip ahead to it, don't you dare. Just sit and wait for it, and be ready for it. It doesn't escalate like I want it to; it doesn't build to anything greater. It is a sudden intake of air, bringing clarity and oxygen and fresh energy, but for — for what? And then there is the void of inaction, the hairs standing up on your arm, the tingling in your spine, where do we go from here? The ninths and the suspendeds, and the horn atmospheres, like a foggy day with massive ships rolling past, slow and graceful destruction, and detachment, fine and fresh and pure.
