Beginning a journey into hardware emulation.

## A little history 

At SUNY New Paltz, all CS students are required to take a course called Digital Logic. Ostensibly this is to begin understanding how a computer works, but more practically it gives students a deeper look into boolean logic. It also helps reinforce the concept of solving problems with limitations.

Digital Logic was an especially enjoyable class for me -- I think if I had more time, I would have changed my major to Computer Engineering for fun.

Since then, I've toyed with the idea of building an emulator, but without the experience of a more knowledgable programmer I've hesitated for a while. A couple weeks ago, I began working on emulating the Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow experience for a class project, and while Ruby made it fun and easy to create inventive ways of emulating the the original games, I can't help but feel that something was missing. 

We can emulate software in a functional way -- a simulacra beneath the facade shown to the user where only the end result matters -- or use software emulating hardware. 

The user probably doesn't care either way, but I feel that for an engineer, it would be a valuable lesson in project management, scope, and building upon one's own work.

Our approach will be simple: if we can accurately simulate the smallest building blocks of logic, then we can build any sufficiently large logic gates by stringing them together without concern.

Generally speaking, if we want this emulation to happen ever faster and more efficiently, we'll rewrite it a compiled and staticly-typed language.

## The most basic building blocks

Right off the bat, we should save ourselves some work by defining things that all logic possesses. 

```ruby
class Logic 
    attr_accessor :input 
    attr_reader :output 
    
    def initialize(input_array)
        @input = input_array
    end 
    
    def eval
        @output = @input
    end 
end 
```

To begin, we're giving ourselves an input array that we can change if we have to, but for the most part we'll expect that once set, these rarely change. Mostly, it'll help during testing and development.

In more complex logic, we'll override both the initializer and the `eval` function so that the functionality matches the chip.

Without getting into frequency or amperage, we know we'll also need power and ground. 

```ruby
class Vcc < Logic 
    def initialize
        @input = true 
    end 
end 

class Ground < Logic 
    def initialize 
        @input = false 
    end 
end 
```

`0` and `1` will be represented by True and False, which will make our logic functions easier to write and understand.

```ruby
class Inverter < Logic 
    def eval 
        @output = !(@input.first.eval)
    end 
end 

class And < Logic
    def eval 
        @output = @input.all? do |b|
            b.eval == true 
        end 
    end 
end 

class Or < Logic
    def eval 
        @output = @input.any? do |b|
            b == true 
        end 
    end 
end 

class Xor < Logic
    def eval 
        @output = @input.one? do |b|
            b.eval == true 
        end 
    end 
end 
```

In our most basic chips, Ruby has our back with array enumators that handle the logic for us. `And` only returns `true` if all its inputs are true. `Or` returns true if any are true. `Xor` is true if only one of the inputs is true.

This is also where we can begin to the see the pattern a larger eumlated system will use -- when a given `Logic` is evaluated, it calls back pseudo-recursively to the evaluations of its inputs. It'll keep going back until the whole system is evaluated, then return to the last chip in the sequence and evaluate it based on the inputs.

We can use these basic blocks to create more complex chips. For example, the NAND structure just contains an AND chip and flips the output:

```ruby
class Nand < Logic
    def eval  
        and_a = And.new(@input)
        @output = !(and_a.eval)
    end 
end 
```

Now, we can build something simple, like a half-adder. Here's the truth table:

```ruby
 A | B  | C_out | S
--------+-----------
 0   0  |   0     0
 0   1  |   0     1
 1   0  |   0     1 
 1   1  |   1     0
```

And the code:

```ruby
class TwoInputHalfAdder < Logic 
    # Half-adder, no carry-in.
    def initialize(i0, i1)
        super([i0, i1])
    end 

    def eval 
        xor_0 = Xor.new([@input[0], @input[1]]).eval
        and_0 = And.new([@input[0], @input[1]]).eval
        @output = [xor_0, and_0] # [sum, carry_out]
    end 
end 
```

Next, a full-adder, which has a carry-in bit:

```
 A | B | C-in | C-out | S
--------------+-----------
 0   0    0   |   0     0
 0   0    1   |   0     1
 0   1    0   |   0     1
 0   1    1   |   1     0
 1   0    0   |   0     1
 1   0    1   |   1     0 
 1   1    1   |   1     1
```

```ruby
class TwoInputFullAdder < Logic 
    def initialize(c_in, i0, i1)
        super([c_in, i0, i1])
    end

    def eval 
        h0 = TwoInputHalfAdder.new(@input[1], @input[2]).eval 
        h1 = TwoInputHalfAdder.new(@input[0], h0[0]).eval
        or0 = Or.new([h0[1], h1[1]]).eval
        @output = [h1[0], or0] # [sum, carry_out]
    end 
end 
```

And in the case of a two-input Multiplexer, which only has one select line, we can use many different structures:

```ruby
class TwoInputMultiplexer < Logic 
    def initialize(switch, i0, i1)
        super[switch, i0, i1]
    end
    
    def eval 
        s0 = @input[0]
        i0 = @input[1]
        i1 = @input[2]
        and_0 = And.new([Inverter.new([s0]), i0]).eval
        and_1 = And.new([s0, i1]).eval

        @output = Or.new([and_1, and_0]).eval
    end 
end 
```

Finally, we'll arrive at one of the most important elements in our building blocks, which is the switch. A switch is one of the few basic ways a user can have direct interaction with logic in a series, and ours includes a special `flip` method that'll allow us to toggle the output.

```ruby
class Switch < Logic 
    def initialize(input)
        @input = super(input)
        @flipped = false
    end 
    
    def eval 
        @output = @input.first.eval 
        if @flipped 
            @output = !(@output)
        end 
        @output
    end 
    
    def flip 
        @flipped = !@flipped 
    end 
end 
```

This is a lot of setup, but look at how easy it is to set up the chips:

```ruby
vcc = Vcc.new 
gnd = Ground.new 

s0 = Switch.new([vcc])
s1 = Switch.new([vcc])
s2 = Switch.new([gnd])

h0 = TwoInputHalfAdder.new(vcc, gnd)

tifa = TwoInputFullAdder.new(s0, s1, s2)

mux_2 = TwoInputMultiplexer.new(s0, vcc, gnd)
mux_4 = FourInputMultiplexer.new(s0, s1, gnd, vcc, gnd, vcc)
```

Next, we'd work our way into increasingly complex multiplexers and hopefully an ALU.
