title: Estimating the Price of Homes in Ames, Iowa - A Data Science Story
---

So my name is Tom and I'm currently in an immersive data science course held by General Assembly. I'm going to take you through the second project we had, which we completed just this past week. The project was to strengthen the core concepts around different regression models, working with closer to real-world data, and encourage a little competition between the classes with a leaderboard on Kaggle ((Kaggle)[kaggle.com] is a great resource in the data science community for for both learning and practicing different concepts/models). We were also supposed to perform and showcase some exploratory data analysis. Oops.

This blog is absolutely a work in progress by the way, so stick with me as I figure out how to change everything around. Thanks for your patience!
