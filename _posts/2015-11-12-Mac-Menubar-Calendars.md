In your daily tasks you create, save, edit things. You can be a designer, editor or a developer. Version Control systems give you the ability to keep track of what you did to the file, what you changed and what the contents of those changes are.

I was recently in need of a Mac menu bar Calendar App... After some digging I came across the ones below. Here is a short review of my findings:


### iCultus - Free

### Day-0 - Free

Day-O is a simple menu bar clock replacement with a simple calendar for your Mac. It’s free, as-is.



### Itsycal for Mac - Free

Itsycal is a tiny calendar for your Mac's menu bar.

If you want, it will display your calendar events as a companion to the Mac Calendar app. You can also create and delete (but not edit) events.

On OS X 10.10 Yosemite (but not 10.11 El Capitan*), you can move Itsycal in the menu bar just like the built-in Apple menu extras by holding down the ⌘ key and dragging.





### iStats Menu 5 - $18

iStat Menus 5 sports a completely new design &mdash; new menubar icons, new dropdown menus, and the app and icon itself have all been redesigned to be cleaner, clearer and more at home on El&nbsp;Capitan and Yosemite. Menubar graphs can now use dark backgrounds, improving legibility.
