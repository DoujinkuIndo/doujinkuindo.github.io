Itsycal is a tiny calendar for your Mac's menu bar.

If you want, it will display your calendar events as a companion to the Mac Calendar app. You can also create and delete (but not edit) events.

On OS X 10.10 Yosemite (but not 10.11 El Capitan*), you can move Itsycal in the menu bar just like the built-in Apple menu extras by holding down the ⌘ key and dragging.

iStat Menus 5 sports a completely new design &mdash; new menubar icons, new dropdown menus, and the app and icon itself have all been redesigned to be cleaner, clearer and more at home on El&nbsp;Capitan and Yosemite. Menubar graphs can now use dark backgrounds, improving legibility.
