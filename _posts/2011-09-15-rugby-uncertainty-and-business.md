>...Uncertainty, though, cannot be overcome and it can be more debilitating if players don't know where they sit. You can manage this process when there is an end goal, but as you near this goal the need to eliminate uncertainty also arises... via [England's all-black strip fails most important test](http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/englands-allblack-strip-fails-most-important-test-20110914-1k9pm.html).

Although writing about the current 2011 Rugby World Cup this principle also applies to the business workplace. Uncertainty is crippling. Having a defined method of dealing with situations of uncertainty can help.
