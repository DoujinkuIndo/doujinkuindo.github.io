title: The Three Perspectives
layout: post

Every project must take into account three perspectives: the business perspective, the technical perspective, and the customer perspective.

Too often projects focus on the technical perspective at the expense of the business, or the business at the expense of the technical. Often the customer is completely ignored.

However, Scott Berkun writes: "Every business consideration has technical and customer implications (which is the same for all of the other permutations)."

As we create our plans, we need to weigh the perspectives against each other:

"Some decisions will need to be made that favor one perspective over another, but that shouldn't be done by accident." It's about "getting as much value from each perspective as possible."
