title: Ubiquitous Reading

Software Engineers rarely have time to read books. So when an engineer gets excited about something they *are* reading, I'm on board. I'll buy the book and read it too; to build ubiquitous language on our team. It fosters clear communication.

(Ubiquitous Language is a term coined by Eric Evans in [Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) (which I have not yet read, tbh). A great article describing the concept is [Ubiquitous Language & the Joy of Naming](https://blog.carbonfive.com/ubiquitous-language-the-joy-of-naming/)).
