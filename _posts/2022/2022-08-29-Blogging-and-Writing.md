Seth Godin suggests blogging every day (including Saturdays and Sundays). At more than 7000 posts, he walks the talk. His writing, podcasting, and thought leadership continues to amaze me.

Similarly, Jonathan Stark sends a daily email. Both of these writers are extremely consistent, and I read rarely miss reading what they have to say.

Seth recommends giving a daily blog post a shot for 90 days. While [the first 1000 are the most difficult](https://seths.blog/2018/10/the-first-1000-are-the-most-difficult/), those who have made it to 200 have been glad they have done it.

[Tenacity](https://www.workinggenius.com/) is a working frustration for me. Consistency can be difficult when my wonder and invention lead me to other shiny things. I'm going to get back on the writing path for the time being and see where it takes me.
