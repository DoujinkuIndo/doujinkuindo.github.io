First post in the entire blog! Here will probably rarely be updated, unless I find the motivation to continue posting here commonly about the different projects that are being worked on.

In this one I will just talk about the process of the Bike Race Remake project from the beginning to now, and the different features planned and included at the current moment, since I have nothing else to put up, so why not.

## [brr](https://brr.breaddevv.com) *The Bike Race Remake website, at the time of posting this is currently not open, but if you're looking back it may be open already.*

Let's start off with the beginning of the entire project. Let's see it as a timeline.

insert date here
The Beginning of the project.
should probably finish this later on, stuff about the old project

#### November 11th 2021 - The remake of the remake
Context, I recreated the project because there was too many issues with the old one, such as resolution issues, some texture issues etc.

let me finish this later lol
