First post in the entire blog! Here will probably rarely be updated, unless I find the motivation to continue posting here commonly about the different projects that are being worked on.

In this one I will just talk about the process of the Bike Race Remake project from the beginning to now, and the different features planned and included at the current moment, since I have nothing else to put up, so why not. This will be a massive read so just a warning!

Just a little bit of context before this, if you don't know what the BRR (Bike Race Remake) project is, it is a project I am creating to attempt to bring new life into the world of Bike Race which was created by (at the time) Top Free Games/Wildlife Studios (now), and attempt to keep the community alive and maybe even bring people back since they seem to have abandoned the game as a whole. You could see this more of a fan-game than a main game, but still a game nonetheless.

## [BRR](https://brr.breaddevv.com) *<--- The Bike Race Remake website, at the time of posting this is currently not open, but if you're looking back it may be open already.*

Let's see this as a timeline.
If there are images and videos that I am able to post, they shall be posted later on.

#### August 28th 2020 - Thoughts On A Remake
On August 28th 2020, I made a post in the GodOfBikeRace Facebook group, talking about how I'm interested in messing around in the Unity engine, and maybe try remaking Bike Race. This was the main idea that sparked the entire thing, since the game seemed to be going on a major decline in population and support.

#### January 4th 2021 - Feature Requests
Through the few months between the last post and this post, I was digging through lots of files, different IPAs, APKs, attempting to find as many files as I could to begin the Remake project. I then asked in the GodOfBikeRace group, what people would want to add to Bike Race if they could. At the time of making this post, this came to around 215 comments, which have all been looked through and decided upon already. This was a very tedious process, since I had to decide whether these ideas would be ethical to the game, and whether the community would even enjoy these features.

#### January 6th 2021 - Title Screen Mock-up
I posted a screenshot of a title screen mock-up that I created in the Unity engine from the assets I brought together. This was very scuffed, it wasn't the greatest, some assets were entirely wrong and some assets had extra parts that weren't supposed to be there, such as the dirt not having the white background cut out entirely, and not even the normal bike made an appearance. At the time I was fairly happy with how it looked, but compared to now, I think I would lose my mind if I kept this.

#### January 9th 2021 - Options Menu
3 days later, I posted a video that showed the current state of the Bike Race Remake, the video showed the Multiplayer, Tourney and Duels placeholder scenes that mentioned that they were not implemented yet and to 'Check back later', then it showed the Options menu, it was very basic, it had a Music and SFX toggle, and a Credits button, that would show a box that explained that Remake was nothing to do with TFG/Wildlife at all, and that it was simply just a side project.

#### January 14th 2021 - Singleplayer Level Select
Around a week after the options menu post, I made another post showing off the Singleplayer GUI, this followed from the iOS version of the game. This was a very long process because I had so many issues with the Scroll Rect, but eventually I managed to get it working. Along with the SP menu being shown, I showed off an extra pack that did not exist in the original game, Dunes 3, since Dunes 3 is a high priority on things to do in the game.

#### January 19th 2021 - Singleplayer Pause Menu
During the 5 day gap between the last post and this one, I worked on the pause menu for Singleplayer. This was very scuffed, like the Title Screen. The original developers seemed to have enjoyed settings most of the assets at an angle to give it a 'futuristic' look, don't get me wrong it's a nice change and makes the GUI look very clean, but at times it can be a bit overboard. Either way, the assets were at angles, and they didn't even line up, the spacing went completely off, just because I had them at custom sizes which meant they wouldn't line up unless they matched. This pause screen contained everything you'd expect it to. Resume, Next Level, Retry, Garage and Home. But I also added an extra button on, which would be a fairly useful feature, being the Previous button. Nothing major, just something that can take you back to the last level, if you really wanted to.

#### January 30th 2021 - The Infamous 'Release Date' Incident
A good while later, I posted that I was delaying the release of BRR due to the main controls of the Bike not working correctly. I hate that I did this. I'm not big on having release dates, at least not anymore. All it does is make you (the developer) stressed because you believe you need to reach these deadlines just for the community to be happy. I will admit, I did this more times than I would've liked, even though I would've liked to have no release date. All that kept happening was the release was delayed further and further until eventually I just stopped announcing that I was 'releasing' it on a certain timeslot. This was a massive weight off my shoulders, as it let me actually focus on working on the game, without any pressure of 'You have to release this now, or the community won't be happy'. If I'm entirely honest, for things that I look forward to, I'd prefer to not have a release date at all, I'd prefer to just have it teased every now and again and then BOOM it's out and ready to download. 

#### February 16th 2021 - Feature Feedback
I posted a Google Poll for the community to give feedback on some of the features I plan to include in the game, as I wasn't sure on whether to add them or make them different. I felt as though the community should have more input towards the game. I left the poll running for a few days and ended it about 2 days later. This was a massive help to know what the community wanted to see in the game, rather than adding something that no one wants/will use.

#### March 18th 2021 - Development Update
I posted an update talking about the BRR Development, which wasn't much, mainly just talking about how I've barely been able to work on anything a lot, and that I attempted to contact the original developers to see if there would be any legal issues between my game and theirs, no reply as expected honestly, but we continue.

#### April 11th 2021 - The Hard Drive Incident
Around this time I attempted to replace my 500GB HDD, with about 90% of my stuff on there with a 1TB one, to at least give me more storage, but little did I know the Windows Boot Manager decided to install itself on my HDD, so it wouldn't let me boot into my SSD. What was on my SSD? Early builds, entire folders of images that were yet to be imported to the project, and a few IPA and APK extractions I didn't go through yet. So that was a lot I lost, but gladly the project was stored on the HDD that I copied across to the other drive before this issue, so that was still in-tact and in working order. Small loss but nothing major.

#### April 14th 2021 - No Motivation
I cleared up a few things explaining that I lost motivation to work on it, but not at all did that mean I was cancelling the project, it was just going to be held on a hiatus. It was at a point where it was 'close to being playable to release', assuming it was still working on the SP controls, so not entirely as close as people would've thought probably. I left the project on a hiatus for a short time, not entirely sure how long it was, but it was fairly short.

#### June 26th 2021 - Tournaments Development
I posted a video showing off the tournaments menu that I had been working on for a while, showing off the tournaments screen which was in a 'working' state, there were a few issues like me not setting the scroll rect to the correct size so after the tournaments cards finished it just went off into a void, however the garage seemed to be working fairly well, showing off around 37 Thunder Phantoms, with the name 'bike_name' since the names were not implemented yet. The special chest screen was done but had no functionality and the same with the player screen, it was sort of given the base bones to begin constructing it, but was not given any features that worked at the time.

#### June 27th 2021 - Tournaments Development Part 2
In the next video posted a day after the last one, there were significant changes to the GUI such as the cards changing and being a fairly decent size, and stuff such as the garage cards actually fitting the bikes they are supposed to rather than being multiple thunder phantoms. I left a few what I thought would've been 'a nose exhale' on both the special chest and player tabs, the special chest talking about how its a 'vending machine but you don't get what you want', and the player tab saying how 'you're playing the game like its the last thing on earth' for being level 100. Granted this may not be a thing in the full release, but it also may be funny to have, where you have a certain message for being a certain level.

#### November 17th 2021 - The Remake Of The Remake
I don't know what I was doing during the 5 month gap between the last post and this, but it was probably something along the lines of considering certain things for the project. Who knows. One thing I do know is that I was considering restarting the project as a whole, since the original project had a lot of issues that I stated before, such as resolution issues and overly being quite scuffed. I felt it would be much more work to go over everything specific and replace things and fix things resolution-wise and the other issues it has, felt like an old code-base.

#### November 28th 2021 - End Of November Check-up
In around 10 days after recreating the project, there was a main overhaul of the menus etc. I began working on a new Settings Menu instead of the old one, I wanted to make it similar to something like [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) where it would slide out from the side of the screen, and so that's what I did, I made the settings menu slide out from the side of the screen. I started out with just having it appear by setting the GameObject from False to True, and then eventually added in an animation through script instead of doing a regular animation to attempt to keep performance at a decent point. It felt like a fairly decent upgrade for the start of the new project, and makes the GUI feel fresh. I also began working on the volume levels of which can be edited in the settings too, but they're quite a simple fix. I also added in a Login Dialog Box, since I plan to have some form of login to the game, so things like Multiplayer, Tournaments and Duels can be played and records in Singleplayer can be submitted.

#### December 30th 2021 - End Of December Check-up
Not a great amount was done this month, mainly because I forgot to commit to the repo, and ended up forgetting what I did so there is barely any details on what I committed. Based on the ones I do know, there were a few scene changes where I can actually navigate between menus in Play Mode, along with adding a level select menu for the Desert pack. Not much else was done.

#### January 30th 2022 - End of January Check-up
Quite a fair amount was added this month. Starting off with config files, I have a plan to save settings to the config file, like a config file does. I also started adding some functionality to the Login box, to make it slide in when the button is pressed, and also able to close out. I began work on the local side of the Duels menus, both Legacy (Android) and New (iOS). This went fairly well and I'm quite proud of how they ended up turning out. There is still a few issues in the New Duels, but they can be looked into in a further date. 

#### February 30th 2022 - End Of February Check-up
Good amount of things added this month. Started off with some Title Screen edits, such as changing the Login Box to say 'Guest' to indicate they aren't logged in yet. I proceeded to add a bit of functionality to the Login box, allowing Login and added a MOTD (Message of the Day) which probably won't be a message of the day, it'd be more of an update to say 'hey the servers are going to go offline for insert time', just to warn people. I started adding in the main bones for the 'better level selects' that appear in a hacked version of the original game, I personally prefer this level select over the other ones, as it gives an overview of the level before you see it and allows you to pick your bike without having to go into the store. There was also a major issue that happened, and I still have no idea what happened to cause it, but it was easily reverted and a few fixes later we're back on our feet. I continued work on the login system, using MAMP to test it locally, and all appears very well so far.

#### March 31st 2022 - End of March Check-up
I did practically nothing this month and I hate that I did that, also on the fact I still haven't committed a mass amount of changes on my Mac, which I should probably do. I'll update this part of the post when I commit those changes. One thing I can say I did was make a credits screen. This was fairly simple to do, and it isn't fixed entirely, as I need to make it fit screens, but that is an easy fix to do. Other than that I believe that is it for this month.

There is a lot of things that have been done over the ~1 year this project has been going. A lot of issues that I've ran into but we've continued onwards attempting to make things 10x better. I'm not sure whether I will continue updating this overtime, but this is where we are at the time of posting at the end of March 2022. I appreciate you reading! o/

#### April 2022 - End of April Check-up
Nothing was posted during this month so there's nothing to say here.

#### 24th May 2022 - My Worst Nightmare
Sh*t. This was something I prayed wouldn't happen, at least not for a while. The entire game has gone down. Tournaments, Duels, UCL Editor, Groups, Tasks, everything is gone. Granted it's happened before but my goodness. Now that all of this is offline, it means I have to edit the priorities I currently have -which isn't a major issue, just slightly irritating- to work on the online aspects of the game a lot more, so when it does come to the time to release, they can be easily improved upon rather than starting from nothing. Damn you Wildlife Studios.

#### 9th June 2022 - One of my favourite features
Sure I may be biased, but I really like this feature implementation. This took a bit to get working, but after I did I was quite happy. This feature allows the user to pick what title screen they want on the game. It doesn't affect the title screen itself, for example if you pick the 'Android' title screen, you will also get the 'Android' level select screens etc. Nothing much else to talk about on this matter, but I'm fairly happy with this feature.

#### 9th July 2022 - Proof of Concept in Multiplayer
I made a quick mock up of a level select in multiplayer that hopefully can be toggleable in MP game settings, where the player will be given a pick of 3 randomly selected levels to pick from to record a race on. I don't know how to explain it but I'll attempt to: When a player has finished the initial race after the replay, and it comes to recording a race to send, the player will pick from 3 options of levels that have been randomly selected and race that level, which will be sent to the opponent, and the same thing will happen for the opponent. It'd probably be better explained in a video but I don't have that video right now, maybe I'll do it in the future, but I don't have it right now.

#### 23rd July 2022 - Release of the Bike Race Web Editor Backup
## [BR Editor](https://brr.breaddevv.com/breditor.html) *<--- The Bike Race Web Editor website*
I had this hosted for a good while, and just never mentioned anything about it in case things would break any time in the future and the fact that levels wouldn't save, so there wouldn't be much of a point in having the editor up. but after a while nothing broke and people still showed interest in wanting to use the editor, so I decided to just hand it out, and with a few users accessing it, things still havent broke! Which is surprising for free hosting. I did want to have it hosted on my actual domain, however when I tried it, for some reason it did not like it and nothing worked, so I kept it on the free hosting. Looking at the analytics, things are fairly stable, which is good. I was hoping to do something like have its own saving system so people could save their levels and have other people play it, but that would mean I'd have to reverse the entire thing and rebuild it.
## Technical Description (Skip if you don't care)
When you save a level, it sends a request to 'bikerace.com/users/anonymous/tracks' (which in itself is a little odd, maybe they planned to have accounts?), which is where EVERY level is saved towards. This link probably sent something to their S3 link that actually stored every level, but because every part of the 'bikerace.com' website has been met with a 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable error, this link is inaccessible, making the saving process impossible. However loading levels works fine due to the S3 link being perfectly fine, therefore everything stored in there is intact and accessable. The main idea was to see if there was any way to recreate the users/anonymous/tracks on my server that can upload the level to their link, however this would be really tedious to recreate as I would have to get it right to even have a chance of bringing back the saving part of it. I could recreate the entire UCL process however this would mean I'd have to redirect every single request towards the UCL database on the actual game towards mine, meaning there'd be no UCLs that are stored on Wildlife's servers accessable. It would be something I'd look into but it would take a lot of time, that is already being used working on Remake.

#### 25th July 2022 - Groups Infrastructure Test
Groups has been offline on Bike Race for a good while and I wanted to attempt something along those lines that could possibly be brought back, it was a fairly simple implementation, first locally then some things online. There's not a lot going in the background but I have a barebones version working, probably won't be great for handling multiple users but works for one.

This project was long overdue and it really pains me the fact that I can't get versions out yet. There's a lot I need to do in the background and obviously the fact that I have a life (kind of) gets in the way of that so I work on it whenever I possibly can.
