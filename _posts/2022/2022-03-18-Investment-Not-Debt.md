Instead of framing everything wrong with your system as technical debt, call it a technical investment.

By investing in your codebase, you have the freedom to make bold leaps into the future.

Investing in your codebase means less frustration for your most expensive resource: your engineering team.

Investing in the code means you're not scrambling to recover from an incident.

Time taken to improve your system is an investment.
