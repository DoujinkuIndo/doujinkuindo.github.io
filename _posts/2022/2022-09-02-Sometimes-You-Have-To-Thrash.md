title: Sometimes you have to thrash

Software engineers hate to waste time. That's why they're so adverse to meetings - why sit around talking when they could be writing code?

Even when those meetings seem to go around in circles, there can be value there. Thrashing around a topic can bring clarity for subject matter experts who don't always see the consequences of their requests.

Thrash, but thrash forward.
