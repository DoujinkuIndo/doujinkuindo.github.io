title: The Daily Shutdown

I'm working on getting better at what Cal Newport calls the [work shutdown ritual](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/) rather than closing my laptop and getting the heck outta Dodge.

TBH, I'm still pretty terrible about it. I added a 15-minute block to my calendar at the end of the day to remind me to take the time for my daily shutdown, but I still don't always follow it.

What's in my daily shutdown?

* Review my Full Focus Planner for the day. Move any open items to Google Tasks or create calendar events.
* Double-check that I've tracked all my time blocks for the day.
* Review tomorrow's tasks and meetings
* Block time for tomorrow for any big tasks.
