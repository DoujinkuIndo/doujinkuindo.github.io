title: The Towing Calculator
---
As we decided to get a travel trailer, we quickly discovered that a towing capacity 
stated in the manual of my car is not actually even remotely the only value needed to safely tow a trailer.

It all has to do a relationship between the payload – or cargo capacity of the vehicle,
also called TV (Towing Vehicle), and the tongue weight. 
The tongue weight is usually 10% – 15% of the overall trailer weight, when properly distributed.

There are several factors involved in calculating the payload of your TV 
and the tongue weight of the trailer. Besides taking both to the scales to 
make sure those are accurate with the data from the guys at 
[Keep Your Daydream](http://www.keepyourdaydream.com/payload/) I wrote a simple online calculator.

Is it open source? Well of course it is, but even better, you can access it 
from your phone or computer. (https://frsanchez.github.io/TowingCapacity/)

Hopefully it works for a lot of people and please leave a comment here if you use it.
