As we decided to get a travel trailer,
we quickly discovered that a towing capacity
stated in the manual of my car is not actually even remotely the only value needed to safely tow a trailer.

The result has to do with the relationship between the payload capacity – or cargo capacity - of the vehicle,
also called TV (Towing Vehicle), and the tongue weight.
The tongue weight is usually 10% – 15% of the overall trailer weight when properly distributed.

There are several factors involved in calculating the payload of your TV
and the tongue weight of the trailer. Besides taking both to the scales to
make sure those are accurate, using the data and formulas from the guys at
[Keep Your Daydream](http://www.keepyourdaydream.com/payload/) I wrote a simple online calculator.

Is it open source? Well of course [it is](https://github.com/FrSanchez/TowingCapacity), but even better, you can access it
from your phone or computer. I also added the [calculator](/calculator) to this website.

Hopefully it works for a lot of people and please leave a comment here if you use it.
