## Students incoming

Recently, undergrad student Ezequiel and PhD students Bartolomè and Agustìn came back from their first 2021 field trip where they performed nest search and nest site determinations on the beatiful rivers of Traslasierra Valley. This work will be reflected in the Ezequiel honor thesis, soon. Here are some photos from them (and little Felipe, the (un)official lab pet).
