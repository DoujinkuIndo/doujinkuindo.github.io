## 1. Classic two-column layout with CSS Grid
### Learning Objectives
1. Define a grid container with `display: grid`.
2. Define the columns of a grid container with `grid-template-columns` and the `fr` unit.
3. Span a `header` and `footer` across two columns with `grid-column`.
4. Create a gutter between items with `grid-gap`.

**Sample Code**: [Grid Examples]({{site.baseurl}}/sample-code/frontend/grid/)

## 2. HTML Images: Aspect Ratio
Objective: To understand the importance of image aspect ratio, and be able to preserve aspect ratio in HTML images using CSS (or, more accurately, how not to break it in the first place).

**Sample Code**: [Examples of HTML and CSS Images](https://codepen.io/browsertherapy/pen/oNxRLOX) Codepen

## 3. Simple Flexbox Gallery
### Learning Objectives
1. Define a flex container container 6 or more square Lorem Picsum images as items.
2. Set the container to wrap the items into more than one line.
3. Justify the items within the container so that the last line of items is always centered.
4. Reduce the number of flex items to 3. Are the items large/small enough at different screen widths?

See Example 1 below:
