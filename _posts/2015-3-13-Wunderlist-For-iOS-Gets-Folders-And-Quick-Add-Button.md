title: Wunderlist For iOS Gets Folders And Quick Add ButtonIn Need of A Home
---

Wunderlist for iOS received a nice update yesterday. You now can sort your lists into folders and there is the addition of a new Quick Add button. The button allows for you to quickly add a new list or new to-do. Unfortunately, this option hasn't made its way to the iPad yet, but after reaching out to the Wunderlist team on Twitter, they have confirmed that it is on its way. So if you haven't yet, update the app and check it out for yourself. Or, if you have never used the app, download it and start getting your life organized.

Glad you like the rest of it though! ^Polly\</p\>&mdash; Wunderlist (@Wunderlist) \<a href="https://twitter.com/Wunderlist/status/576114151191240704"\>March 12, 2015\</a\>\</blockquote\> \<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"\>\</script\>
