# Take Off The Blues — The Foreign Exchange

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6OueWQ0O4 Ah, R+B. My guilty pleasure. I have no idea where I got this song (it doesn't show up in any of my playlists), but it stumbled into my Genius playlists one day. It fits perfectly; it's the modern successor to Otis Redding, Smokey Robinson, Sam Cooke. Or, iTunes seems to think so. I know exactly what I see in R+B — it's catchy, jazzy, soulful and meaningful; about feelings or sex, always. It's talented and danceable and I do love the timbres of it — but I'm more interested in _why_ that timbre sounds so good. Is it because it's so different from the indie rock I'm used to?
