title: list of easy to pronouce colors
---

I needed simple to pronounce and clear names for my machines using in face 2 face training. I touhgt on colors. But usually my thinking on colors finish after red, blue, yellow, green (I want to avoid words starting from the same name, so grey, or black was not great names). So I type it in google. I tought that it's crazy search "[list of easy to pronouce colors](https://www.google.com/search?q=list+of+easy+to+pronouce+colors)". But I found: [List of 20 Simple, Distinct Colors](https://sashat.me/2017/01/11/list-of-20-simple-distinct-colors/). 

```powershell
$colors = "Blue", "Cyan", "Grey", "Lime", "Magenta", "Navy", "Orange", "Purple", "Red", "Teal", "White", "Yellow"
```
