Alright, welcome to the third and last post about the Active GNSS antenna design saga. In this one I'll post about the actual results obtained from the constructed antenna. First of all, here's some nice pictures of the fabricated PCBs of the antenna and the LNA.

Having this completed I realized different things I could address to improve this antenna, therefore,  I'll keep posting more updates on GNSS antennas in the future. I have an upgrade for the LNA board design, and I'm working on a new, more compact version of the radiating element!

I'll try to diversify, and my next post will be about something different than GNSS, but I'll come back to GNSS in the future for sure.

So stay tuned folks!
