[Yashima](http://www.greenbriergames.com/main/index.php/project/yashima/) is another Greenbriar Games release I have in for review. I first saw it at PAX East, and was instantly drawn to it by it's art style and amazing looking miniatures.

The components are sparse, but top notch. The tiles are thick and sturdy, the miniatures of a high quality plastic, and the cards are nice and snappy.

I've seen a lot of good things said about Yashima, and I'm excited to dig in and see what all the hype is about!
