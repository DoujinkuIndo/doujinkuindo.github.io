title: 'External Post&#58; Raspberry Pi GPIO with Zig'
comments_id:

A while ago I wrote an article about a small project that I did in the [Zig Programming Language](https://ziglang.org/) about controlling GPIO on the Raspberry Pi. Zig is a neat language and the whole project ended up being a whole lot of fun. You can [read the article here](https://zig.news/geo_ant/low-ish-level-gpio-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-zig-1cn3). Although Zig is a very new -- and, at the time of writing, immature-- language I encourage everyone to take a look, because rather than aiming to replace C++ in all its power and complexity, it aims to replace C which makes it conceptually very different from a language like Rust.
