If I can pull this off a few of you are probably going to hate me.

Wish they&#8217;d hurry up and announce some dates already.

In other news, last night I hit up Little Birdy at the Metro for their major album launch type gig. Was good, caught up with a few work people and friends, made a couple new ones and even Ellen made it out to the show for a bit&#8230; which had its perks when it turned out she knew most the bar staff &#8211; HELLO FREE DRINKS!

It was a bit of a work function last night, kind of a &#8216;everyone-come-meet-the-label/band-we&#8217;re-now-distributing&#8217; type deal so there was a kind of  &#8216;afterparty&#8217; (ie. free drinks and stand around and chat in the Metro foyer) and who should be there but ol&#8217; pal Rob Gyro! Had a bit of a chat with him, drank some reeeeally strong drinks (again, blame Ellen&#8217;s bar friends) and kicked on till about 1am&#8230; not too bad an effort considering it was a school night.

Little bit buggered now though.
