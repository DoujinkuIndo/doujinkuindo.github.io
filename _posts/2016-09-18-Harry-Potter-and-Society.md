Children’s books are often taken very lightly, routinely being filled with magic and wonder. This is probably why I’ve never really thought of the implications that the word usage and composition of Harry Potter could have on children. In *Representations of Gender and Agency in the Harry Potter Series*, Sally Hunt uses methods of text analysis to observe instances of gender inequality in the novels. In her studies she explores the imbalance in the use of words representing boys, which was much greater than the use of words representing girls. As well, her exploration discovered that the novel routinely equated more action words with boys and less with girls by a very large amount. This gender imbalance could affect young reader’s perceptions of women’s importance in society as well as enforce stereotypes of women being physically inferior. The uses of text analysis to take  a closer look at what an author’s word choices mean is an incredible way to re-evaluate and re-consider the things we present to children. I would be incredibly interested to see a study spanning many different children’s books to see what they could possibly imply, and maybe to observe any popular beliefs or struggles held in a generation and what their reading material could have influenced in it. Potentially, it could be used by authors to survey and look closer at their work before it is published to determine if it is telling the message that they intend it to.
