I had the opportunity to go to Winnipeg beach on Saturday June 16th. I arrived at the beach at around 2:30 PM. I sat down in a secluded area by myself and lost myself in the serenity of the ocean.
I loved going to the beach as a kid and this took me back to the "Good old days." I loved feeling the breeze on my face and hearing the waves crash on the shore. It was such an incredibly calming feeling and I was happy to just be there. Not do anything, just sit in silence and exist.

I definitely found it very calming, but I'm not sure if I can pinpoint what it was that I found so
calming. The repeated action of the waves on the beach was definitely part of what helped establish a tranquil ambiance. I remember smelling the saltiness of the sea water. After a stressful week of fast paced summer classes it was nice to relax and slow down for a change.

Before I knew it, it was already 4PM. Although it wasn't the nicest of days to visit the beach, it was cloudy and windy, I still had a good time. I still look back on my time an cherish it whenever I find myself trapped in the bustling urban routine most of us are all too familiar with.
