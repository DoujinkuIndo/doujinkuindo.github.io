# I Need My Girl-- The National

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0xixWrzC7E On an album that’s great but not perfect from a band from which I’ve come to expect perfection, this track is my first favorite.  It’s on the back half, and it keeps me from getting stuck in the first part of the album, as I’m wont to do.  As far as semantics go, I absolutely hate the phrase “my girl.”  Every bit of it rubs me the wrong way.  But something about the plaintive purity with which it’s sung makes it feel okay, kinda like when you realize that that whole album Girlfriend by Matthew Sweet is totally misogynistic but it’s also really real so you’re gonna let it go this one time.  I heard this song for the first time a few weeks ago when I saw The National at the Barclays Center.  Matt Berninger introduced it by saying, “This one has no clever metaphors, this is just about me missing my wife.”  (Total lie.  It has a lot of clever metaphors.  But we’ll forgive him.)  It was one of the high points of the show.  (Other high point?  Hearing 17,000 other people sing “I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees” when I thought, for some foolish reason, that that line had been written just for me.) I Need My Girl is about the dirty parts of love.  Co-dependence.  Finding beauty in someone else’s worst, most private moments.  It’s a love song by the guy who brought you a song with the line “I’m afraid of everyone.”  It makes me really glad and really sad to be single all at once.
