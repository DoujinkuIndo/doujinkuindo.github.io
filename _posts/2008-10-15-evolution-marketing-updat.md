It is now two weeks in to my new digs at
[Evolution Marketing](http://www.evolutionmarketing.com.au/) - and it sure is fun.

Primarily I've been learning how to drive
[ACT!](http://www.sagebusiness.com.au/pg-ACT-customer-contact-database.seo), software to take care of your contact management. Yesterday and today I've been playing with custom tables in the ACT! MS-SQL database. While ACT! looks after contacts and tasks, meetings & calls to do with your contacts really well, some clients would like to be able to do even more, like handle job sheets etc. Which is the reason for the custom tables. These allow us to track all sorts of other information and connect them to contacts & companies.

I've also setup a
[Blackberry Bold](http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrybold/) simulator and a
[Windows Mobile 6](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/default.mspx)
[Emulator](http://www.lancelhoff.com/2008/03/20/how-to-emulate-windows-mobile-6/), this allows me to experience the same things as our clients, notably
[HandHeldContact](http://www.handheldcontact.com/), which allows you to sync multiple calenders, notes, histories etc to your phone - loads more than MS Exchange alone allows.

To paraphrase the paragraphs above, I'm having fun learning new stuff!

The other staff at Evolution are great to work with, the coffee is good and all the tech toys I've asked for have been delivered, with the exception of the telephone headset, but it is on the way so they're forgiven ;-). Woot!

Update 20th Oct: Got the telephone headset on Friday afternoon. Cool.
