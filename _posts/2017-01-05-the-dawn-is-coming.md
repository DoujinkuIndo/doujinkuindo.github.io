I want to leave this DBA role in 2016 and run this blog as a developer as I change my job.

The purpose of this blog is to record my learning history and career as a developer and to write down my understanding of the process. Currently I am preparing to move into Machine Learning field. So this blog is going to start with mainly the contents of this field.

I thank my wife for supporting my decision.
