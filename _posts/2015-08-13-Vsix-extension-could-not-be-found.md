title: Fixing "Extension could not be found" error
---

Occasionally when working on [Code Connect](http://codeconnect.io/) and [Alive](http://comealive.io/) Visual Studio would cease to build our VSIX package. The error we would see said `Extension '<GUID>' could not be found. Please make sure the extension has been installed.`

We found a few solutions online but none of them worked for us. Eventually we worked out a very simple solution:

### Solving Extension could not be found

To get Visual Studio to build the solution, open the extension's main project's **properties**. Navigate into **Debug** tab. Under **Start Options**, clear **Command line arguments**

Hit `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build the solution. Once it builds, restore **Command line arguments** to `/rootsuffix Exp` (or anything that was there previously) and build again.

This time the package will be built and the extension will be deployed to the Experimental Instance of Visual Studio.

### Other solutions

Other solutions that we've found, but didn't work for us

 - Increasing the version of the package in the .vsixmanifest file
 - Running **Reset the Visual Studio 2015 Experimental Instance** tool
 - Uninstalling extension from the Visual Studio Experimental Instance

Good luck!
