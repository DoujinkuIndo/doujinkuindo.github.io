title: 5 Design Podcasts You Should Be Listening To
---

As creatives, one of the best way for us to improve our skills in the industry is to listen and learn from those around us. In a world where communication is rapidly becoming almost completely web-based, podcasts have become a very popular and convenient alternative to your typical text-and-image blog. For those of us who like to torture ourselves with multitasking, being able to pop in some headphones and listen while doing work is incredibly convenient.

I've been listening to a bunch of podcasts lately, both at work and in the car on my drives to and from. I've started to really get into a few of them, and here are some of my favorites:

### [5. Pixel Recess](http://pixelrecess.com "Pixel Recess Podcast")

Pixel Recess is a fairly short (the longest episode runs about 11 minutes) off-topic podcast hosted by [Paul Armstrong](http://paularmstrong.me/ "Paul Armstrong") that airs every Monday at 6pm. While this podcast isn't very informative, it is a hilarious respite from the constant flow of work you may be bombarded with on a daily basis.

### [4. The Freelance Web](http://thefreelanceweb.com "The Freelance Web Podcast")

The Freelance Web is a relatively new podcast, having just released its 12th episode. Hosts Sean Johnson and Liz Elcoate do a fantastic job of discussing specific points of interest related to freelance work. Entire podcasts are dedicated to things such as estimating payments and developing side projects, giving this particular show a fresh feel that is both different and concise.

### [3. Happy Monday](http://happymondaypodcast.com/ "Happy Monday Podcast")

I'm kind of bummed that I just recently discovered Happy Monday. It is quickly becoming my favorite design-centered podcast. Josh Long and Sarah Parmenter are naturals at keeping a positive discussion going. The hosts' ability to participate in stimulating dialogue, along with guest spots including the likes of Seth Godin and even industry favorite Jeffrey Zeldman provide listeners with riveting dialogue every Monday at 7am GMT.

### [2. Boagworld](http://boagworld.com/ "Boagworld Podcast")

No design podcast list would be complete without discussing the incredible Boagworld podcast. [Headscape](http://headscape.co.uk/ "Headscape Design Agency") co-founders Paul Boag and Marcus Lillington talk web design and give informed answers to questions listeners send in. The duo are hilarious with their mocking of each other, themselves, and occasionally the listener. Paul and Marcus' years of experience as well as the delightful format of the show make Boagworld a must-listen.

### [1. ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com "ShowTalk Podcast")

ShopTalk makes number one on my list for a lot of different reasons. This incredibly popular podcast is consistently aired every Thursday at the exact same time (if you don't know what time that is for you, check out their homepage), and hosts a slew of well known devs and designers in the industry offering their take on current events and listener submitted questions. [Dave Rupert](http://paravelinc.com/ "Paravel Inc.") and [Chris](http://css-tricks.com "CSS Tricks.com") [Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net/) are amazing hosts and have really come to understand what makes a podcast _good_ in the last year. I love how every couple of weeks they'll forego the guest spot and instead share the show in a _rapidfire_ format, just answering questions from the audience. I would recommend this show to anyone in the industry.
