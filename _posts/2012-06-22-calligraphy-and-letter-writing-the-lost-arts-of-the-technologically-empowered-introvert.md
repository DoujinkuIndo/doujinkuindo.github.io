# Calligraphy and Letter-Writing: The Lost Arts of the Technologically-Empowered Introvert

I got a long, wonderful, eloquent letter today. It was a present, but it wasn't about my birthday. It was a chance for someone I care about to really spell things out in a way I'm unaccustomed to. It will join my box of letters and memories, but It's easy to read and look back on. I -- There. That was a break. I went and got up and checked on the letters. One of them was bent and I put it in another envelope, outside of the box, an annex. It wasn't even the letter I was talking about. I just wanted to make sure it was okay, because one day that box is going to be the most valuable memory I have of high school, and I don't want to lose it to carelessness or temporary blind wrath. Not that I have that at the moment. The newest letter is different. It's praise, unabashed, but not worship. Don't live afraid, live clever and kind and loving, and especially that last part. Don't worry. Things shake themselves out. Care about the things you care about. Don't worry if other people are different. Lessons I knew, lessons I learned ages ago, but that's not the point of friends to teach you new things. They can only remind you of what you already know and are sick of hearing but are glad to hear anyway. Thank you.
