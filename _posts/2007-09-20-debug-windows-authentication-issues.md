Julie, the back room tech, just wrote an article on [how to enable debug logging to better solve authentication problems](http://thebackroomtech.wordpress.com/2007/09/19/howto-enable-windows-debug-logging-to-solve-authentication-problems/) on MS Windows 2000, 2003. No doubt this will also help with tracking down a multitude of other error messages that would otherwise remain unseen.
