Welcome to my blog in which I aim to explore some of my personal and professional favorites: Programming, Math and the occasional ramblings.

I am neither an expert nor an authority in any of these fields (except for rambling, in which I consider myself very capable). Read this blog if you want to accompany me during my learning experience. The blog posts are my personal notes while exploring the subjects. It is me explaining to myself as I learn. Hopefully whoever stumbles across the posts finds it helpful to watch me discover new knowledge rather than teach things I already know.
