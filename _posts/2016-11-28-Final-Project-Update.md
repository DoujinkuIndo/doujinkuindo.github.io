<i>“The secret of getting ahead is getting started” – Mark Twain</i>

  FINISHED. After 50 researched novels, 42 Visual Representations, 14 textually analyzed books (20 initially), and one 1351-word write up, our project is finally finished. In brief, we used the text analysis software KH Coder and produced 42 visual representations, three for each book. The three types of visuals were; hierarchical clusters, multidimensional scales, and co-occurrence networks. Each type of visual for all books were analyzed and compared as a whole. Observations were made based on the use of qualitative and quantitative data interpreted by the three different visual representations. Conclusions were heavily based on similarities or dissimilarities displayed by past versus present books, and were used to answer our argument question. 
  
  In conclusion, the argument question “How has the language, syntax, and grammar of science fiction novels changed over time?” was indeed answered, as prior analysis and observations show that the conventionally-written past books has significantly changed over time to the creatively-written present books. These differences are what makes classic old books and ambitious new books unique from each other.
