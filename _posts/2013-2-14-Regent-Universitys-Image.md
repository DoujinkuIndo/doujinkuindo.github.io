title: Regent University's Image

Regent University strives to put its best foot forward. The school spends millions of dollars a year on both local and national marketing campaigns. However, something that may be holding them back are continual, questionable comments made by their founder, Dr. Pat Robertson. But is Regent’s marketing campaign ample enough to negate the stereotypes that the Robertson name bears with it?

Regent University held its quarterly “All Staff and Faculty Meeting” on Tuesday. Among the speakers was Sherri Stocks-Miller, VP for Regent University’s Marketing and Public Relations. Stocks-Miller, 49, shared a number of statistics on what Regent was doing to market itself in the community.

“We want to communicate Regent as a top quality, top ranked, best value education really in the world,” said Stocks-Miller. Regent is working hard on creating an image for themselves to make this possible.

The university was ranked in the top 20 for online education by U.S. News & World Report last year. Regent’s marketing department has taken this ranking and incorporated it into their local campaign, which include billboards, The Virginian-Pilot, Inside Business and military newspapers. Stock-Miller’s keynote stated that the entire campaign ran Regent “approximately $3.5 million in national media value.”

Stocks-Miller boasted that, “for the second year, we are number ten in the bachelors program in online education. Number ten!” She goes on to say that, “The MBA program was recognized as the number one MBA for faculty and credentials in the nation by U.S. News & World Report.”

Stocks-Millers refers to those who come into contact with Regent’s marketing as “impressions.”

The Beazley Foundation, a foundation housed in Portsmouth, said, “Congratulations to Regent University for providing Virginia’s highest-rated liberal arts education.” A rank the university was given by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a nonprofit.

While these are great accolades for the school, they don’t show what Regent is doing to sway public opinion.

Last summer the school ran ad campaign they named “Rediscover.” Part of this campaign was a series of television spots, two of which Stocks-Miller played midst her presentation.

The TV spots were a montage of clips of students across campus with facts about the school. They said that Regent donated $3 million in “volunteer time and services,” and that it contributes $312 million a year to the Hampton Roads economy. Stocks-Miller said that the Rediscover campaign reached “four million impressions.”

But what other “impressions” has the university made? On January 15, Regent University founder and chancellor Dr. Pat Robertson, stated on his show The 700 Club that “awful-looking” women are to blame for some failed marriages.

The topic got brought up because a 17-year-old boy wrote in to Maxim Magazine asking for advice on how to get his father to notice his mother more. Robertson decided it was his place to bestow his sage wisdom to the boy, who was probably not watching if he sent the question to Maxim. Robertson said, “It may be your mom isn’t as sweet as you think she is,” and that, “she may be kind of hard-nosed.”

Robertson went on to attempt to tell what seemed to be a bad joke gone wrong about a woman who was “awful looking, her hair was all torn up,” and “was overweight” who went to speak with a preacher. She asks the preacher what she can do because her husband had started to drink. Robertson finishes his story with, “and the preacher turned to her and said, ‘madam if I was married to you I’d drink too.’” Robertson’s cohost on the show exclaimed, “oh my!” while turning and shaking her head in disgust.

This isn’t the first time Dr. Robertson has said something that has raised a few eyebrows or turned some heads. In September 2011, Robertson said that it was okay for a man to divorce his wife if she had Alzheimer’s disease. Robertson’s cohost asked him about marriage vows that contain “until death do us part.” He simply replied that, “This is a kind of death.” Dr. Robert Stern, professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Boston University’s School of Medicine, said that Pat Robertson was wrong and that, “the feelings are the last to go.”

Most Christian denominations look down upon divorce due to the Gospel of Mark where Jesus says that to divorce your wife and remarry is the same as committing adultery. It appears that Robertson has written his own translation of the Bible and one that most of the Christian world would disagree with.

Dr. Robertson’s off-the-cuff comments are flippant and becoming disregarded more and more. In January 2012, Robertson said God told him who was going to win the next presidential election but says, “I’m not supposed to talk about that.” Cenk Uyger, reporter for The Young Turks, the world’s largest online news show, replied to Robertson’s comments warning viewers that, “Pat Robertson is a fraud of the highest order…he scams people for a living,” and that, “he is a snake oil salesman.”

Russell D. Moore, Dean of the School of Theology and Senior Vice President for Academic Administration at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote on his blog about a comment that Robertson said about a man who didn’t want to marry a woman who had internationally adopted children. Moore wrote, “He said the man ‘didn’t want to take on a United Nations,’ and that, after all, you never know about adopted children; they might have brain damage and ‘grow up weird.’” He continues by saying, “I am taking a deep breath here and reciting Beatitudes to myself.”

In light of Regent University’s Marketing & Public Relations’ keynote on Tuesday, it can be said that Regent University is doing a great job in its marketing and public relations. However, it can still make one wonder if the loose-lipped televangelist hinders their efforts. How many negative “impressions” does Robertson make?
