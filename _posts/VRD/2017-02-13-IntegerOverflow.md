-Integer Underflow
-Integer Truncation
-Integer Nuances
-Integer Conversion
-Integer Casting/Types
Integer vulnerabilites can be significantly damaging to software and can lead to breakages within the control flow of a program.
This post will be going through the Integer Overflow, Underflow, Truncation and Conversion. The post will go through the theoretical and practical description of the vulnerability.
