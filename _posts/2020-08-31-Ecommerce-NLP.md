title: "Exercise: The Importance of NLP for E-commerce"
---

If it’s one thing that COVID-19 has made us realize, is that there is an accelerated need for businesses to find digital solutions for their products. This is especially evident in commerce, where now more than ever, we are seeing consumers turning towards shopping online. Even though there is a need for greater investments in order for businesses to accomplish this and adapt to this change, the light at the end of the tunnel is that there is now even more data being generated. We can in turn use this data to improve the digital shopping experience, by allowing us to better understand consumer behaviour. While we are all spending more time at home these days, in a way we are more connected than ever - through the conversations we are having online - directly and indirectly - with each other globally. At any given moment, there are millions of online users interacting through instant messaging, direct messaging through social media, leaving comments on posts, leaving reviews on products - there are so many conversations happening. So often, I am basing my shopping decisions on the collective reviews  and ratings that others have provided. So for marketers and business owners, we need to be able to make sense of these conversations - why our customers enjoy our products and why they don’t. I wanted to take this opportunity, to perform a simple exercise, to showcase what we can get easily draw from these conversations. Using a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews) of reviews from a women’s e-commerce website, and leveraging [NLP](https://medium.com/greyatom/a-dive-into-natural-language-processing-103ae9b0a588) through the [bag of words](https://medium.com/greyatom/an-introduction-to-bag-of-words-in-nlp-ac967d43b428) package in Python, I was able to find the following.

Without going into the technicalities of NLP (if you are interested in learning about NLP and bag of words, [Jocelyn D'Souza](https://medium.com/@djocz) does a great job of explaining it in the two posts I've shared above), what we as marketers and business owners care about at the end of the day, is why we should care about this and how it benefits us. In this dataset, we are provided with the users' reviews and whether or not they would recommend their item of purchase, among other things. With these two columns, we can build predictive models to determine based on a user's review, how likely they are to recommend that item. However, for the purposes of this exercise, I wanted to focus on a more exploratory approach by analyzing the correlation between the two columns, to see what insights we can find. 

As a visual learner myself, through using word clouds, I was able to showcase the key terminology that frequently appear in the reviews so we can easily see what the general topics these conversations are about. And of course, as great as visuals are, it is still important to see numbers so I have included frequency table of these words as well to see exactly how often these words are appearing.
