# All Bad Ends All — The Books

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw7pR_MFk5M The Books are the closest thing to a true audio collage I've ever heard. This music would be art house music; it would be indulgent and masturbatory, if it weren't for the fact that it's _good_. It's listenable and enjoyable and creates patterns and riffs from the chaotic sampling of a trillion obscure cassette tapes, accompanied by acoustic guitar. It breaks in and out of genres, cuts out partway, but it is not _produced_. [Afuken](http://www.jbuckland.com/blog/deck-the-house-akufen/) is produced samples, but The Books sound organic. This is computer-made music, and it reflects the advent of technology in music — but it does not _demand_ attention to the production. It stands alone, the way a novel should, be it written on typewriter or Microsoft Word. I think that is a virtue.
