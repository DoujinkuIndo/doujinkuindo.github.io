### Git
*The Git Parable* is a good article to understand how Git works (https://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html). The video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4) is long but will help me to understand Git faster.

We also learned more common orders in Git:
  1.git reset (reset the head to previous 1/2/3 pointer)
  1. git merge
  1. git cherry-pick
  1. git cat-file -t => figure out the type of the hexdecimal file
  1. git cat-file-p => show the compressed content of the hexdecimal file
  1. git show => showing tree and parents
  1. gitk => visual tool to show the git structure

### PowerShell
1. start. => open a folder
2. md => make directory
3. cls/clear

### Java
1. This article talks about the basic concepts and terms in Java (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/)
1. Today we learned about four important concepts in Java: *casting*, *properties(methods)*, *class*, and *visibility*
1. ***encapsulate***: wrapping up data under a single unit
1. ***polymorphism***: literally it means "many shapes", which refers to the capability of Java to transform data into different classes of java.lang.Object
