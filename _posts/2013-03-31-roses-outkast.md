# Roses — Outkast

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9lkxq7tGuY _Roses_ — the actual song of which starts at about 1:00 in, in the video above — is _magnificent_. OutKast at the height of their ambition, half Prince/Michael Jackson, half hip-hop; a West Side Story parody, a hate-song (instead of a love-song); call-and-response, full of visual puns, set as a high school, funny and dramatic and an incredible song to boot. I don't know much about Andre 3000 and Big Boi, but I know that _Roses_ was from Andre's half of their dueling double album, _Speakerboxxx/The Love Below_. And that jazz intro! Moreover, the song is addictive; it hits a certain timbre in my ear that can't get enough of it. The tone of Andre's voice, the organ and steady, slow drum beat; the call and response from Big Boi; the micro-repetitive patterns and subtleties to the lyrics and melodies; the variations on a theme; it's all perfect.
