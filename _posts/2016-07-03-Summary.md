# My life: The important bits
If you're visiting this website for the first time. There's probably a good chance I've met you! So congrats, you're on my personal section of the internet and I'm happy to have you. This is my first post and what a better way to kick off a new blog by posting about myself :o)

## Teenage years
I'm Steve Chen. Born in the 90s, grew up in an empty household with eggs, ramen, and hot pockets. I had my first computer when I was 10, it was a Sony VAIO desktop: looked really sheek, futuristic, and could run Warcraft 3 on all high settings. I got into computer gaming really hard, it also coincidentally coincided with my family moving to a different city, switched schools, and life changes. I didn't care, I still had my video games.


Most of my time in my teenage years was spent gaming on said desktop. I got really familiar with computer hardware and took a class preparing for the CompTIA A+. I was socially inept and tired most of the time from going to bed at 1am to forcefully waking up at 6am. High school and middle school was brutal. Not many friends, and of those friends, they weren't the type of people to invite me to their birthday party. I don't blame them though, god I was weird. However, I day enjoy one aspect of it, a web design class taught by my history teacher, [Zac Gordon](http://zacgordon.com/).

## 2009 High School Web Design
Mr. Gordon, is a very unique teacher, he was easily the youngest out of the entire administration, couldn't write with chalk for shit but was very very good at teaching. Web design 7 years ago was vastly different from the web design standards of today. There were no popularized front-end frameworks suitable to teaching 15 year olds, Flash was just breathing it's last breath, and UX just wasn't called UX.  

However, in that climate. I learned alot about freelancing, web page architecture, and good design with HTML/CSS. Mr. Gordon was really good at making sure our entire semester was spent hand writing wireframes in our loose-leaf notebooks, prototyping them in Adobe Fireworks, then finally developed with Dreamweaver. We weren't allowed to use the design(?) function of it. Our tests consisted of a quick eyeball on a 800x600 CRT monitor and just the ability to improve what you had before. At one point we even hosted the first ever high school web conference that consisted of free doritos and soda. It was great, I eventually took what I knew from this class and apply it to my first gig at a veterans tech startup.
