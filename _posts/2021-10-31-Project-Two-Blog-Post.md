In project two we started by loading in the data and did a few things in
data manipulation to get the data in good shape. Then we worked on
summaries, plots, and exploratory data analysis to review the data which
helped get familiar with the data and what columns were available to
work with. Then we worked on our modeling, comparisons, and finally
automation.

I don’t think I would do anything differently in this project, I think
it went really well and it was great working with a partner. The most
difficult part was working with someone else in GitHub with the
push/pulls when we were working on it on the same time. Once we figured
that part out, which didn’t take too long, it was smooth sailing. I
liked working on the models as well as the automation was probably my
favorite because I haven’t done automation of a script before.
