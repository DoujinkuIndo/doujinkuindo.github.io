title: A new beginning. 
---

I've been saying for years that I would start a blog. And so here we have it. 

This is the charting of my personal journey of interests, hobbies, and work output. This blog will be my personal accountability to ensuring I learn new things and apply them. I keep telling my daughter to learn new things, apply the things you learn, and learn from your mistakes. It took me far too long to realize that I wasn't walking the talk I was feeding her. So not only is this effort an attempt to make myself personally accountable, it's also an effort to make myself accountable as a parent as well.
