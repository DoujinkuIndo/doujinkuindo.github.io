title: A new beginning. 
---

I've been saying for years that I would start a blog. 

This is the charting of my personal journey of interests, hobbies, and work output. This blog will be my personal accountability - and my accountability as a parent - to ensure I learn new things and apply them. I constantly tell my daughter to learn new things, apply the things you learn, and learn from your mistakes. It's time I put those words into actions.
