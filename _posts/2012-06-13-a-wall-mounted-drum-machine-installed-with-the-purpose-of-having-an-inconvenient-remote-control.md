# A Wall-Mounted Drum Machine, Installed With The Purpose Of Having An Inconvenient Remote Control

At the end of every year, the Jazz room at Hunter cleans its shop. They get rid of old equipment and give it to anybody walking past who wants it. The result of this is that I currently have (and have had) in the corner of my room a drum machine + stand + pedals which I have not gotten to work for over a year. MyÂ plan is to bring this to Illinois, to mount it on my wall or over my desk or somewhere useful, to break it open and fix the computer and put it an Arduino which can recognize the pressure inputs, and to hook it up to the lights, fans, speakers in my room. The fun part here is that rather than being a convenient remote, this drum machine requires a lot of pressure to activate. It will probably require punching the drum pads in order to register them. So hopefully, I can walk into my room, punch the wall, and turn on all the lights. That seems like an awesome first-year Engineering project.
