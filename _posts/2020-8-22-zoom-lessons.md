I have been accompanying my daughter in her online zoom classes
for the last few weeks. I believe there are some lessons that we (the
adults) can learn from the kids and carry into to our own life,
atleast  into our meetings.

* All types of questions are fair game

Generally, the kids (and their teacher) seemed to be interested in
asking all sorts of "Why" questions than you would normally hear in a typical
office meeting, which seem to be flooded with "How" questions. And
some of the why questions have no real answers like the one I heard
last week, "Why is a spider called a spider". This open thinking and
questioning needs to find more time in our office meetings.
 
* Non judgemental kids

The kids seem to be less judgemental and everyone joins in with their
own wacky questions, instead of making fun of or sneering at other's questions.

* Hardly a dull moment

Interestingly, there was never a single dull moment in the class,
creating a fun and stimulating learning environment.
