title: Rework First Level

A visual rework of the first level.

# Map

The map of the first level remains the same it just got a visual overhault.

The level is enhanced with different textures and models that we found on a distribution website for 3D models. the license of the models allows use to use them even if we publicly distibute the game.

There are currently objects that do not fit the theme of a junkyard. These objects will get an overhault at a later date.

The level could be integrated in a larger open world and would need no changes.

The ground was replaced by 3 different ground models that were used to build the path of the level. in order to bring more atmosphere to the level, there are now two trailers in the level. These also block the entrance to the upgrade.
