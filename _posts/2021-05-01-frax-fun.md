I tried to watch Marie Kondo, but Netflix has completely disabled screenshots. So, fractals!

A very oozy, oily Christmas fractal. 

![Against a space-black background, oily spirals of green and blue layered paint-like textures pour like slowe moving honey. Unlike honey, the edges are ragged, as if water droplets are bursting apart when the surface tension is broken.](../images/Christmas-pour-30_Apr_2021_23_18_37.jpg)

I love rainbows, and I love giving my fractals rainbow textures. 

![A fractal like hundreds of bolts of lightning snaking through a black sky.  The lightning is colored like a cross between candy and a rainbow.  It looks approximately as complex and textured and intricate as the veins on a maple leaf feel.](../images/Rainbow--30_Apr_2021_23_30_12.jpg)

This fractal reminds me of chocolate.  

![An intricate set of called that looks like a chocolate factory poured half-melted chocolate into a city block.  I can practically smell the chocolate covering the streets and mounds.](../images/Chocolate-30_Apr_2021_23_37_13.jpg)

Trying to describe fractals in non-visual terms is a challenge.  Ok, imagine the fractal above looks like what would happen if a plastic factory manufacturing St. Patrick’s day toys blew up, covered a landscape in gobs of saint-Patrick’s plastic, and then people have been pulling sticks out of the goop and leaving stick impressions behind. 

![This looks more like plastic being poured into a mold.  ](../images/Frax-30_Apr_2021_23_47_07.jpg)

My plaid shirts are being sucked down a black hole. 

![Imagine your favorite plaid shirt turned into a liquid oil sitting on top of water that’s and swirling down a bath drain.  That’s approximately the vibe this fractal gives off.](../images/Plaid-spiral-01_May_2021_00_00_34.jpg)

More midnight fun with fractals. 

![This looks like what happens when you scatter salt on top of ice in the ice starts to chew holes through the ice.  Except this ice happens to be dyed wild colors like pink and red and deep blue.](../images/Ice-01_May_2021_00_12_17.jpg)
