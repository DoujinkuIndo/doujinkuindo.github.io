There are several methods of research that interest me as a digital humanist. However, my background is in critical analysis of fine arts, and thus digital media analysis is naturally the most intriguing to me.  I wonder if one must go through the same processes to analyze digital versus material content, or if there are new lenses to observe digital media through that I have yet to discover or understand.  And I am eager to learn more about how to conduct research through digital media analysis in order to curate media collections for educational institutions, and help develop new content for current and upcoming technologies such as virtual and augmented reality systems.

With digital humanities research encompassing such a broad range of topics, it is difficult to choose only one area to focus on.  Personally, I find that I am most interested in understanding the relationship between worldwide cultures and digital media.  How people around the world interact with each other and discover themselves through digital technologies and networks is perennially fascinating to me.  My recent study abroad visit to Japan began an interesting journey to comprehend through a different lens what it means to exist the information age.  Iâ€™d like to continue that journey.

All digital literacies are important to me as a digital humanist.  However, I feel like mastery of negotiation, performance, and networking would be most immediately beneficial to me based on my present career track and professional interests.  I would like to be able to appreciate and understand cultural perspectives and personal identities in order to recreate a digital environment that would help educate and promote tolerance and cultural awareness.
