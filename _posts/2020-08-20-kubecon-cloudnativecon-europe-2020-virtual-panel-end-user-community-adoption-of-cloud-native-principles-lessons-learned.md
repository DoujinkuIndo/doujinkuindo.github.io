I always love hearing stories from adopters of cloud native! This panel features Mastercard, Spotify, Condé Nast and Lunar, recorded at KubeCon EU Virtual and hosted by myself.

Panel on End User Community Adoption of Cloud Native Principles & Lessons Learned, featuring:
* Cheryl Hung, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (moderator)
* Jennifer Strejevitch, Condé Nast
* Kasper Nissen, Lunar
* Ken Owens, Mastercard
* Lee Mills, Spotify

> This panel brings together engineers from the CNCF End User Community to provide their insights on the journey their respective companies have undergone in their transformation to Cloud Native. Each End User member company discusses their Cloud Native principles and what has worked along with what has not worked. Topics include operational best practices, developer experience, CNCF projects evaluated and implemented, and vendor management along with the lessons learned along the journey.
