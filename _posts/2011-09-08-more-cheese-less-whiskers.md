On the ride to work this morning I listened to the podcast over at Duct Tape Marketing, where John Jantsch interviews Dean Jackson who "outlines several case studies in which he applies the customerâ€™s best interest approach and produces incredible results where the sales only approach had failed miserably."

Really enjoyed listening to this, and will a few more times yet.
