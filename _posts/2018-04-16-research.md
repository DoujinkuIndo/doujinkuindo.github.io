title: (Under Construction) Keeping up with Data Science Research after Leaving Academia
---

Data science research moves quickly, and you'll soon be left behind if you don't keep up with the newest trends and research happening in the field. Although you'll (hopefully) do some literature review when starting a data science project at work, you may miss out on an interesting avenue to go down to solve a problem without the background knowledge that such a new methodology or model exists.

One of the transitions I found the most difficult after graduate school was keeping up with the newest research without the culture of academia. When you're in school, you're surrounded by professors and graduate students whose main jobs are in researching new ideas and reading others' research. When you enter the workforce, you have to additionally focus on deadlines, clients, and the day-to-day work of an office. You may also find that the people around you, particularly those who haven't been in school for a very long time or those who are less techincal, have no interest in research, so it's harder to absorb new research ideas around the water cooler like you can while in university. 

After a little time in the workforce, I have come up with what I think is a fairly good list of data science resources, including blogs, courses, and sites to keep you abreast of trends in data science before you get left behind by the fast-moving field.

**Conference Talks**
One of the best ways to keep up with new research is to attend conferences. But of course, conferences are expensive and time-consuming, and you may not have the ability to go to all the conferences you would like. There's a wealth of conference talks on youtube, but searching for your favorite researchers or data science topics go a long way in narrowing down the talks that would be interesting.

**Mailing Lists**

There are a few mailing lists that I find particularly helpful for sending you weekly or monthly updates on what is happening in data science, without having to scour the internet for interesting papers or blogs.

**[Data Elixir](https://dataelixir.com/)**

Data Elixir is a weekly data science news e-mail list. Although it's a little light on research papers, Data Elixir has a great selection of good tutorials, blog posts, and less-technical news articles sent to your inbox. I think this email list particularly shines with visualization tutorials, which are sometimes forgotten in other email lists.
