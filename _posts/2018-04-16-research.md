title: Keeping up with Data Science Research after Leaving Academia
---

One of the transitions I found the most difficult after graduate school was keeping up with the newest research without the culture of academia. When you're in school, you're surrounded by professors and graduate students whose main jobs are in researching new ideas and reading others' research. When you enter the workforce, you have to additionally focus on deadlines, clients, and the day-to-day work of an office. You may also find that the people around you, particularly those who haven't been in school for a very long time or those who are less techincal, have no interest in research, so it's harder to absorb new research ideas passively like you can while in university. 

It may seem daunting at first to keep up with the massive amount of new research being published in the field every day, just by having a good set of resources and setting aside a few hours a week, you can keep abreast of a lot of new research in the field. Here's a list of the resources I use to keep abreast of new research in data science to avoid getting left behind by the fast-moving field. Obviously, this isn't exhaustive, but hopefully it'll give you a good start to explore new research in data science.

**Conference Talks**

One of the best ways to keep up with new research is to attend conferences. But of course, conferences are expensive and time-consuming, and you may not have the ability to go to all the conferences you would like. There's a wealth of conference talks on youtube, but searching for your favorite researchers or data science topics go a long way in narrowing down the talks that would be interesting.

Some good conferences to start out with are KDD, IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, and aibythebay.io. The former two are more academic conferences where you can learn about more theoretical aspects of data science, whereas the latter is focused on applied data science in a startup context where you can see those theories applied to real-world problems. 

**Mailing Lists**

There are a few mailing lists that I find particularly helpful for sending you weekly or monthly updates on what is happening in data science, without having to scour the internet for interesting papers or blogs.

Data Elixir is a weekly data science news e-mail list. Although it's a little light on research papers, Data Elixir has a great selection of good tutorials, blog posts, and less-technical news articles sent to your inbox. I think this email list particularly shines with visualization tutorials, which are sometimes forgotten in other email lists.
