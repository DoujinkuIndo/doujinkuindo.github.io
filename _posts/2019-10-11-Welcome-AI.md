title: Welcome to ACM AI!
---
It's October, which means attending your first classes, making new friends, and of course, finding what to get involved with on campus! A warm welcome from UCLA ACM AI to all of our freshmen, transfers, and returning students; we just wanted to take a moment to introduce our organization.

ACM AI is the largest AI-related student organization at UCLA, and is one of the committees of [UCLA ACM](http://uclaacm.com). 
Our mission is to create and develop a community of students who are interested in **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** at UCLA and beyond. 

## Why learn about AI?
What's the first thing you think of when you hear the phrase "artificial intelligence"? It might conjure up images of humanoid robots or driverless cars. You might have heard things about AI taking over the world or replacing people's jobs. Even influential figures in tech have polarized opinions on the subject:

> *"The new spring in AI is the most significant development in computing in my lifetime. Every month, there are stunning new applications and transformative new techniques." -Sergey Brin, Co-founder of Google*

vs.

> *"I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that.” -Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla*

Despite their opposing views on the subject, both of their companies use AI in their everyday technologies. Google uses AI to rank search results, target advertising, and to understand human language in its voice assistants; Tesla uses it to analyze data from its cars to develop new autonomous capabilities.

You probably encounter AI in your daily life as well; it powers voice assistants like Siri and Cortana, tailors the personalized content you browse through on Facebook and Netflix, and is behind the face filters on Snapchat.

Regardless of whether you view AI as an ultimately beneficial or detrimental technology, it will impact virtually every industry in the future. We think learning about it can only be an advantage in whatever field you pursue, and that's why we offer opportunities for students of various experience levels to gain artificial intelligence and machine learning knowledge both at and beyond UCLA.

## What do we do?

**Workshops**  
As part of the workshops initiative, we host introductory machine learning workshops where we teach concepts through presentations, coding exercises, and interactive activities. We have both beginner and advanced track workshops to cater to students who have no experience and also those who have some prior ML knowledge.  
Workshops Officers: Aaron Philip (Director), Harsh Chobisa, Ben Limpanukorn, Varun Sivashankar, Vaishnavi Tipireddy

**Projects**  
The goal of our project teams is to provide an avenue for members to practice and improve their ML skills via an applied project. They are aimed at those who have some machine learning experience already, and are looking to expand their practical knowledge. We have two project teams for this quarter.
Projects Officers: Keshav Prasanna (Director), Bryan Chiang, John Dang

**Outreach**  
We are partnering with ACM TeachLA this quarter to host introductory machine learning workshops for students at a Los Angeles high school! We also hold one-off events to spread interest in AI to those outside our organization.  
Outreach Officers: Sharvani Jha (Director), Arjun Subramonian

## Upcoming Events

At our Fall General Meeting on Monday, October 7, we introduced ourselves and our specific plans for the Fall 2019 quarter.
