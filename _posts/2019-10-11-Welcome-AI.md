title: Welcome to ACM AI!
---
It's October, which means attending your first classes, making new friends, and of course, finding what to get involved with on campus! A warm welcome from UCLA ACM AI to all of our freshmen, transfers, and returning students; we just wanted to take a moment to introduce our organization.

ACM AI is the largest AI-related student organization at UCLA, and is one of the committees of [UCLA ACM](http://uclaacm.com). We think artificial intelligence is one of the most important and influential fields in technology today, and we're not alone. From Elon MuskOur mission is to create and develop a community of students who are interested in **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** at UCLA and beyond. We have three larger categories of initiatives through which we work towards this goal. 

**Workshops**
We host weekly introductory machine learning workshops where we teach concepts through presentations, coding exercises, and interactive activities. We have both beginner and advanced track workshops to cater to students who have no experience and also those who have some prior ML knowledge.
Workshops Officers: Aaron Philip (Director), Harsh Chobisa, Ben Limpanukorn, Varun Sivashankar, Vaishnavi Tipireddy

**Projects**
We have two project teams this quarter. Project teams are for those who have machine learning experience already and are looking to expand their skills through practical applications.
Projects Officers: Keshav Prasanna (Director), Bryan Chiang, John Dang

**Outreach**
We are partnering with ACM TeachLA this quarter to host introductory machine learning workshops for students at a Los Angeles high school! We also hold one-off events to spread interest in AI to those outside our organization.
Outreach Officers: Sharvani Jha (Director), Arjun Subramonian
We hosted our fall general meeting to kick off the Fall 2019 quarter on Monday, October 7th. You can view the meeting's slides [here](https://tinyurl.com/acmai-fall2019).
