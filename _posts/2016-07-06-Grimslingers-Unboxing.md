[Grimslingers](http://press.greenbriergames.com/sheet.php?p=project_grimslingers) just arrived in the mail yesterday, and I just had to crack it open. Everything from the box to the cards is beautiful, and I can't wait to get this one to the table! I love the fact that it can be played quickly in versus mode, or can be played as a longer, 4 session co-op story mode.

Greenbriar has a history of some amazing looking games, and even though this comes in a smaller package than their usual fare, it still looks just as stunning
