# Midwest Dispatch

It’s 1:30 am on a Friday morning, and my friend Omar needs groceries. He’s been doing car work, so he’s traded in his beamer for a pickup — a 1973 Chevrolet C/K Silverado borrowed from a friend. Red velvet seats, two engine blocks from Gibson City in the back.

I walk over to Lincoln St and he picks me up. The heat has dropped from a full hundred degrees that day to a mere ninety-one, so I’m wearing a John Deere baseball cap and white t-shirt with gym shorts. When he leans over to open the door, I see he’s wearing the same.

We drive to Meijer in deep south-east Urbana and park beneath one of the fifty identical cones of streetlamp-light. It’s 2:00am.

The store is absolutely deserted. He gets twenty boxes of ramen and sixteen cans of Arnold Palmer. I pick out a 69¢ Mexican apple soda in a glass bottle. We speed through an automated checkout machine.

Nobody has a bottle opener. Under the cone of light, we rummage through a toolbox in the back of his truck. We try to open the bottle with the claw end of a hammer, and can’t.

I take the soda and place the lip of the bottle cap on one of the engine blocks in the back of the truck. This engine block is made of drop-forged iron alloy. With the lip balanced over a corner, I swing the hammer and bring it down on the tip of the soda, hoping to dislodge the bottle cap.

The bottle explodes, sending glass shards and instantaneously carbonated apple soda flying in all directions.

It’s 2:30am. We drive to a gas station and hose off the car.

Afterwards, we went to Denny’s.
