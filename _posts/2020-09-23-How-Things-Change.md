In an ever-changing world, it is easy to think that “things just happen”.  
Change, even of seismic proportions, is constant but not random. Most of the time it takes a certain sequence of events.  
This blog post discusses 2 frameworks for understanding the mechanics behind change. <sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>   

# #metoo

Let's start with a visual juxtaposition.

Chances are, dear reader, that you immediately recognize the man on the left, but are not sure about the woman on the right.  
He is [Harvey Weinstein][8], a former [movie producer][9].  
She is [Rose McGowan][7], a Hollywood actress. 

What connects them is that Rose M is the person who kick-started the avalanche of revelations against Harvey W.  
She had been [tweeting][11], blogging and [interviewing][12] since 2015, more and more vocally, leading to a [climactic 
speech][13] in a women’s conference.

Over [100 women][10] have since come forward with accusations against Harvey W.  
These span a period of almost 20 years committing abuse against women. These have now lead to his [conviction][14] with more trials 
pending.

That was only the beginning.

Thousands of women (and men) have since come forward with revelations on sexual abuse, resulting in many public figures 
been disgraced around the world. This came to be collectively known as the [#metoo movement][15].  
Most importantly, this kick-started a number of initiatives around the world, focusing on gender inequality in the 
workplace and society.  
The #metoo snowball is still rolling.

Harvey W had been at it for 20 years.  
And clearly countless others before like him have been abusing their power.

Why did it take so long for Harvey W to face justice?  
If anything, it was far from a secret. There had been [public mentions][17] (e.g. [comedy sketches][16]) and even 
[litigations][18] from years ago.

Most importantly: why did the tectonic plates of gender equality only started moving recently?

# A little theory

To answer the above question, let’s examine some key concepts, with regards to influencing people's behavior.  
There are 2 ingredients and a catalyst that are need to “move mountains”.

## Knowledge

The first ingredient is knowledge.

We can classify knowledge in 3 different “types”. 

**Private knowledge**  
There is a fact and only I know it. Or at least so I think...  

This is knowledge about things which I have experienced in my personal life. 
It can range from the trivial (e.g. *I stepped on a chewing gum today*) to the very serious (e.g. *I cannot afford to buy 
food for my children*).  
I am oblivious to the fact that millions of other people might have similar private pieces of information at the same 
time (e.g. they also cannot afford to buy food).

**Public knowledge**  
The fact is out there; for anyone with their eyes & ears tuned in.  

Public knowledge is information (facts, articles, news,...) available in the public domain. This could be anything: from 
truthful facts to fake news.  
For example, [listed company][19] accounts (P & L, revenue,...) are by law in the public domain. So is a [November 2019 
article][20] about a little-known city having an influx of patients at its hospitals.

Public domain can also imply any context.  
E.g. an unrestricted Confluence page in your company's intranet is also public knowledge. In the company's public domain.

In brief, we *can* know about public knowledge. But it is not exactly at the forefront of our thought.

**Common knowledge**
Everyone knows that everyone knows. There is no way of denying or hiding.

This is when you know that everyone else also knows the fact. And the important bit is that will almost surely take action.  
You can no longer ignore the fact, even if you wanted to.

It is also interesting to tie this back to private knowledge, even the trivial sort. <sup>[2](#footnote_2)</sup>   
Common knowledge is the most interesting type, though it might be a little bit elusive. We will come back to that with 
some examples in a minute.

## Overton window

![Overton window](../assets/images/how-things-change/overton.png)
> Image credits: [here][21]

The 2nd ingredient is the “window of discourse”, a.k.a. [Overton window][22].

This framework describes  
* the range of ideas tolerated, accepted to be discussed in public and eventually turning into policy, and
* how society's appetite changes overtime, with ideas and concepts falling in / out of what is acceptable.  
It describes how “ripe” the environment is to accept a new idea (or reject an old one). 

For example, think how not so long ago it was perfectly acceptable to own slaves or burn people alive.

The Overton window concept was originally meant to formalize applicability and success of public policies. However it can 
very easily be used as a tool in any domain. I would dare say it applies to almost every social situation.   
From the most important (e.g. *locking everyone up for an indefinite period of time*) to the most mandane (e.g. *should 
we re-decorate the living room, honey?*) 

## ...and a catalyst 

![Explosion](../assets/images/how-things-change/pexels-skitterphoto-9328.jpg)

What brings these 2 ingredients together? A catalyst.  
The small spec of platinum which will cause a [continuous reaction][23].

The best real-world example is that of a missionary.
The person who has the courage to stand in front of an ambivalent (even hostile) crowd and turn their public knowledge into common knowledge. 

That person is usually driven by an internal knowledge (or belief)

Let’s stick to the missionary example.

The tribe is not faring well.
Animals are dying, prayers to the gods are not doing anything.
This is both private and public knowledge; everyone knows that, everyone can see the signs.
But it is only when the missionary stands in front of everyone and says “your gods are fake, can’t you see?” that the public knowledge turns into common knowledge.
You cannot unhear what you just heard (and you know that everyone else also heard). 

The missionary is not without danger. 
Think a casual burn at the village bonfire. 

The success or failure depends massively on both 
the missionary’s gravitas and persistence: helps a lot if you can also perform a miracle, be dressed differently to everyone else, etc
the tribe’s Overton window: if animals have been dying for years people are more receptive

# Some examples?

Right, let’s put all of that into perspective

## Little gravitas, slow change

Sometimes change can take years to happen.

Let’s not go very far.

IMHO the most authentic example of a missionary we have had in recent years is Nigel F.

Starting off with little to no gravitas he made it up with formidable persistence. 

He helped shape people’s private and public knowledge (I cannot afford rent, another foreign speaker moved next door, I am not moving up socially,…) into a common knowledge (EU is to blame, we lack our sovereignty) 
A shifting Overton window was a nice boon.

Tectonic plates have shifted.

## Huge gravitas, rapid change

![Mario Draghi](../assets/images/how-things-change/draghi.png)

Let’s look at another example, when change takes literally seconds.
All it takes is a missionary with massive gravitas.

Who knows this guy?

Mario Draghi, head of ECB.

And Mr. Draghi stands up and says “ECB will do whatever it takes to save the euro”.

In one phrase the public knowledge (ECB is potent, maybe this cannot go on) became common knowledge (this elephant will crush us, this is not Soros and the pound)

And the euro was spared at that point.

![Euro rates, 2012](../assets/images/how-things-change/euro_rates.png)
> Image credits: [here][3]

Summer of 2012, bond yields of southern countries are through the roof, approaching 6%.
Apparently, in economics 6% is the psychological cut-off point, where a country cannot even dream of paying back its debt keeping things as is.
It will have to devalue its currency to reduce the debt and fuel growth.

For southern countries this meant only one thing: leave the euro.
But that would also be the end of the euro.

# And now to something different!

And a bonus section on int. minorities 
A.k.a. minority rule

At the micro-level it works like this:
Initially a single member or a small percentage changes behavior.
Say a member of a family decides to go vegan, no ifs, not buts.
The hypothetical family instead of cooking 2 meals, decides it is not a big burden, so they all turn vegan.
When this family starts interacting with others, other people now have to cater to this family’s preferences.

You can replace “family and food” with, say, “teams and Github wiki vs Confluence” or “Ruby vs Golang”

This process is called normalisation.
As long as the majority remains flexible (i.e. the minority’s choices do not materially degrade things to cause a backlash), then the minority will prevail.

# Recap and parting thought

![Spheres of influence and control](../assets/images/how-things-change/spheres.png)
> Spheres of influence and control

Going into the mental model of spheres of influence and control


Public / Common knowledge 
Sits in the sphere of influence. Using facts and information to alter the behavior of others.
This takes the efforts of a missionary who takes the public knowledge (facts) and turns them into common knowledge (actionable information shared in the most visible way)


Intransigent minority
Squarely in the sphere of control. Using only our own actions (and stubbornness) to alter other people’s behavior.
