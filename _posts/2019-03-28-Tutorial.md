Turorial of the game that teaches you basic game mechanics.

# Map

The map is designed to be simple and show the player different options of movement.

He can directly see two buttons, one yellow right in front of him. He will most likely move on the yellow button and learn that this will spawn a new cube. Afterwards he might try to move the cube on the green button since the halfpipe directs his movement towards it. The player will notice that he cannot move the cube and will loose interest in it for now.

When he turns around, the player sees a moving object which looks like something important since it is moving in a otherways static world.

After he picked up the object, he'll notice that the red button turned green, which indicated that he can now do something with it.

After he played the NetGame, the door will not open. So he is left with trying out to push the cubve again to see if something changed. The player is now able to push the cube on the button and open the door to the world.

The player willfind himselfe in a open world where he can go whereever he wants. 
But directly infrom of him there are stairs which lead to the first level. The stairs will catch his interest and the player will do the firsdt level.

# Further Activities

Currently there is no notification that the player has picked up something other than the object disappearing. There is also no notification that he learned a new skill. This will change in the futur with a notification of some sort.
