Currently, you can check out my [about][1] page or enjoy these wild elephants having a splash, photographed by [Dan Newman][2] during our visit to Udawalawe National Park, Sri Lanka in June 2019.

This site is new and will become more exciting over time (I know, the anticipation is killing me too).
