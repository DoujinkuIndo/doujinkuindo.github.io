This site is new and will become more exciting over time (I know, the anticipation is killing me too).

In the meantime, you can (1) check out my [about][1] page and (2) enjoy these wild elephants having a splash, photographed by [Dan Newman][2] during our visit to Udawalawe National Park, Sri Lanka in June 2019.
