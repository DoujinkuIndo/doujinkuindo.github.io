I was planning to catch an overnight and wake up in Venice tomorrow but when I went to reserve a seat I discovered everything was booked up, even the expensive seats! Not happy about that, now I have to leave Bern at about 4pm and get into Venice around 10:30pm. Finding accommodation for there was also a hassle but I&#8217;ve got it sorted now.

It&#8217;s about midday now so I might head up Gurten mountain and checkout the view of Bern from up there before I have to head off&#8230; Pretty little town, pity I can&#8217;t afford to stay a few more hours into the night.

Bye everybody
