So you're new to the Linux world, or you're simply new to the Linux shell, well here's some basic tips and tricks that should help you get started.

## Use the '~' symbol to expand to your home directory

As far as I know, the tilde ~ symbol will expand to the home directory of the current user on most distributions/shells. You can use it to quickly edit files that are in your home directory (dotfiles for example). For instance let's say you're in a folder far from your home directory.

```
➜ pwd
/home/user/eclipse/oomph-master/git/org.eclipse.oomph/products/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.installer.product/icons
```


And you want to quickly edit a file from your home directory. You can use the ~ to start from your home directory.

```
➜ vim ~/.vimrc
```

will expand to

```
➜ vim /home/user/.vimrc
```

where user is your username.

## Go back to the last directory

You can use the command "cd -" to go back to the last directory 

```
➜ pwd
/home/user/eclipse/oomph-master/git/org.eclipse.oomph/products/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.installer.product/icons
➜ cd ~
➜ pwd
/home/user
➜ cd -
/home/user/eclipse/oomph-master/git/org.eclipse.oomph/products/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.installer.product/icons
```


## Repeating the last command entered

You can type !! in the terminal to repeat the last command entered

```
➜  ~ apt-get update
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
➜  ~ sudo !!
➜  ~ sudo apt-get update
