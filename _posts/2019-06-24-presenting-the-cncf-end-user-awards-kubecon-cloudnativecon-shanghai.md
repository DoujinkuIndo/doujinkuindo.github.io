At KubeCon CloudNativeCon Shanghai, I presented the End User Award 2019 to DiDi. I also chose to do this in Mandarin, which I've been learning for about eight months.

Although I'm obviously not a native speaker (my parents are from Hong Kong), people told me afterwards it was clear and understandable, and that they appreciated the effort. I was very happy!
