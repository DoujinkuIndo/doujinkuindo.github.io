title: Configure TrueNas ðŸ–¥ for a UPS ðŸ”‹
---

Power outages are very rare, especially in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.
But if they _do_ happen, I don't want to risk loosing my data after a corrupted VDEV.
So I thought, I would get a cheap [UPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply) with a backup battery.
It should just last long enough to give the server time to shut down properly.

## Hardware setup
* Bluewalker USV Powerwalker VI 650 SB LI ([link](https://bluewalker.de/?page=product&item=10121096&lang=de)) with a USB connector
* OS: TrueNas Scale `TrueNAS-SCALE-22.02-RC.2`
* ðŸ–¥ Server: 32GB DDR4-ECC RAM, 8-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v4 @ 2.10GHz

I connected the power cable of the server to the rear plug on the UPS.
Then I connected the USB cable to the rear of the UPS and hooked it into the server.

## Software setup
This really wasn't as easy as I had hoped.
I knew before buying that particular UPS, that it wasn't listed in the supported driver list in the TrueNas interface.
Hence, I expected that some tinkering would be necessary.
But not that it would get that hard ðŸ˜°.

The main goal is to get the OS (TrueNas Scale in this case) to get notified if the supply state changes and take action.
This is a configuration task.
I want my NAS to shutdown once the UPS has to supply the energy from it's battery ðŸ”‹.

This configuration is done through the [UPS Service](https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/services/ups/) in the admin Web-UI.

### Finding the right driver
The first challenge was to find the right driver.
I _thought_ I had to look for a driver that contains `PowerWalker` in its name, because my product also contained it.
That didn't work though.
My next hypothesis was that I might have configured the `Port or Hostname` incorrectly.
To know how and where my UPS was connected through USB, I enlisted the help of `lsusb`.
This CLI-tool is sadly not installed by default on TrueNas Scale.
```bash
sudo apt install usbutils
lsusb
```

The output of that showed me 
```
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0764:0601 Cyber Power System, Inc. PR1500LCDRT2U UPS
```
among other things.
So apparently, at least the USB interface of that UPS identifies itself as _Cyber Power System_, also with a identifier (`PR1500LCDRT2U`).

Another clue was the output of `nut-scanner`:
```bash
$ nut-scanner
Neon library not found. XML search disabled.
Scanning USB bus.
No start IP, skipping SNMP
No start IP, skipping NUT bus (old connect method)
Scanning IPMI bus.
[nutdev1]
    driver = "usbhid-ups"
    port = "auto"
    vendorid = "0764"
    productid = "0601"
    bus = "002"
```

That at least told me that the driver was `usbhid-ups` and _not_ `blazer_usb` (which I initially read a lot in forums).

With this information, I picked the following driver: `Cyber Power Systems ups 2 Value 1500ELCD-RU USB (usbhid-ups)`.
That didn't work either (still).
Looking at `/etc/nut/ups.conf`, I saw:
```
[ups]
    driver = usbhid-ups
    port = auto
    desc = ""
```
This was missing the additional information that `nut-scanner` had provided me with about `vendorid`, `productid`, and the `bus`.
So I added those three lines to the _Auxiliary Parameters (ups.conf)_ section in the WebUI.

Aaaaand .... it worked ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰âœ….

This is my final configuration now:
