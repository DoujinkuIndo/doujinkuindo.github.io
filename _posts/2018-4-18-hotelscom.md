Here are my slides from my talk "Persistent storage for Kubernetes - which solution at why?" at [DevOps with Kubernetes Meetup by Hotels.com](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/devops-with-kubernetes-meetup-by-hotelscom-expedia-tickets-44107262008) on 25 April 2018. In this talk I cover:

* The basic concepts behind storage in Kubernetes
* How to compare different storage options
* The ideal storage for different use cases
* [A live demo](https://demo.storageos.cloud)
