Here are my slides from my talk "Persistent storage for Kubernetes - which solution at why?" at DevOps with Kubernetes Meetup by Hotels.com on 25 April 2018. In this talk I cover:

* The basic concepts behind storage in Kubernetes
* How to compare different storage options
* The ideal storage for different use cases
* [A live demo](demo.storageos.cloud)
