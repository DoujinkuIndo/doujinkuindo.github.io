Just read this great article by James Clear [How to Say No, Resist Temptation, and Stick to Your Health Goals](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-say-no)Â where he discusses the difference between saying "I can't do x" vs saying "I don't do x". The difference in outcomes is greater than I thought.

While he is discussing the use of this phraseology with regard to health and exercise, it strikes me as very applicable to other areas of life also:

- I don't miss my morning walk
- I don't do social media until after my morning work session
- I don't interrupt others

I will spend some time thinking about how best I can benefit from this "don't vs can't" thinking.
