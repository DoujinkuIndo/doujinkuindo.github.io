### Practing Javascript by Building Quiz App
In this Thinkful project I was given The User experience requirements, and Technical requirements. So I got to put the skills I learned in crafting Semantic HTML and following accessibility best practices.

Also I was able to learn more about using jQuery to traverse the Dom and create more interactivity. I must admit I am anxious to learn more about React and Redux to manage state better. But that being said there are so many things you can do with jQuery.

With the help of my mentor I was able to learn more about the application Architecture and how helpful it is to model your data first. And use functional programming, I am very excited to learning more about ES6 so many great new features like generators, classes and the list goes on and on.

In the layout I used a combination of Flexbox and standard CSS. I am also very excited about learning more about Flexbox.

My App still needs a bit more styling. Tell me what you think I am always open to constructive criticism.

Thanks for having a look.
