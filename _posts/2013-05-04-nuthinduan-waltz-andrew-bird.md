# Nuthinduan Waltz — Andrew Bird

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n01Vwr1Wj7Y Beware music analysis; I knew so much about Andrew Bird. I knew he was 23 when the album came out; it was real, traditional folk, before any of Andrew Bird's later, more experimental work; I knew it was self-released; I knew the genre and the influences and the weird imagery of the cover art. And I showed it to people; it was (is) a gorgeous song, deliberate and musically satisfying. I showed it to a friend; she saw the song title and began to laugh; I'd missed the pun entirely, assumed _nuthinduan_ was a region, a place, a genre. It wasn't. _Nothin' Doin'._ I didn't have a clue.
