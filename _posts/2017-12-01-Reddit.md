# Predicting Subreddits 

In this project, I will be predicting the subreddit a post is under based on the title and text of the post analyzed using Natural Language Processing. The catch here is that this data set only includes technical subreddits, so the words used between subreddits are similar. 

## Preprocessing

This Reddit dataset was taken from just one month, and there are limited observations in some categories. So to increase the observation in each category some categories have been combined and expanded. Subreddits with more than 1000 observations were kept; Techsupport, Programming, and Python.

## Up Votes 

One of the few features that had enough variability to be kept in the data set is the up votes each post receives. The distribution for each subreddit is shown below. A cap has been up on at four up votes because there are a few outliers that severely skew the data. Posts with four vote or higher are normalized to having only 4. 

The Techsupport subreddit dictates the distribution of all the subreddits shown in black.

When divided up each subreddit has a distinct shape.

## Natural Language Processing

The preprocessing is taken care of by a single function shown below. The TFIDFVectorizer is used because it increases proportionally to count, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. This is because all the Reddit posts are in some technology subreddit, so it is probable that there is a commonality in the language used.

This function also uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to combine and limit the features the Vectorizer outputs into 500 features. 

There is no standarization because the columns more than 99% of the columns going into PCA are on the same scale already, and the outlier columns (Up Votes), are on a very similar scale.
