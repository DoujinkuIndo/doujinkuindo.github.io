# Predicting Subreddits 

In this project I will be predicting the subreddit a post is under based on the title and text of the post analized using Natural Language Processing. The catch here is that this data set only includes techincal subreddits, so the words used between subreddits are similar. 

## Preprocessing
This Reddit dataset was taken from just one month, and there are limited observations in some categories. So to increase the observation in each category some categories have been combined and expanded. subbreddits with more than 1000 observations were kept; Techsupport, Programming, and Python.

## Up Votes 

One of the few features that had enough variablility to be kept in the data set is the up votes each post recieves. The distribution for each subreddit is shown below. A cap has been up on at four up votes becasue there are a few outliers that severly skew the data. posts with four vote or higher are normalized to having only 4. 

The Techsupport subreddit dictates the distribution of all the subreddits shown in black.

When divided up each subreddit has a distinct shape.
