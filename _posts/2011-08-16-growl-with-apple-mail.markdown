A few days ago I was looking for a place or a way to have my email display growl notifications (Apple Mail) there i have set up my corporate email for some home reviewing, but heck every time the email arrives there is no way to know if to pay attention or not, since it doesnt display a notification or anything just a simple sound (which you have pre configured). <!--more-->

I wanted something more and being an avid user of the <a title="Growl Notifications" href="http://growl.info/" target="_blank">Growl </a>Notifications - http://growl.info/ i started searching for something that included it. A few clicks away and found <a title="Growl Mail" href="http://growl.info/documentation/growlmail.php" target="_blank">GrowlMail</a> - http://growl.info/documentation/growlmail.php unfortunately it was discontinued since it was just a way to teach the community what we can do with a good product. Well the community responded and they build it for os 10.6 and 10.7 and they hosted it in the Google Code Community. You can find it <a title="GrowlMail - in google code" href="http://code.google.com/p/growlmail/" target="_blank">here</a> - but if you want the specific version for 10.7 you can find it <a title="Download" href="http://code.google.com/p/growlmail/downloads/list" target="_blank">here</a>.

To install it properly, read the installation, otherwise it can be troublesome.

I like this application a lot, and since its already integrated in one of my always open programs, why not have it working as well.

Hope you enjoy it!
