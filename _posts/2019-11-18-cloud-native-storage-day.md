During this panel, I discuss operational challenges of cloud native storage at Cloud Native Storage Day, a Day Zero event at KubeCon CloudNativeCon San Diego.

The three panellists are
* Michael Courcy, Sophra Steria
* Anand Ozarkar, Equinix
* Vybava Ramadoss, Microsoft

Questions include:
* What is your use case for cloud native storage and how do you manage stateful apps?
* What are some of the day 2 challenges that you encountered?  
* Sample challenges 1: backups and data movement
* Sample challenges 2: observability, debugging and monitoring
* Sample challenges 3: lifecyle of application - updates & upgrades
* Do operators or helm charts help with the stateful application lifecycle?
* What other processes or tools did you find helpful in managing day 2 challenges?
* Looking forward, what challenges do you anticipate in future e.g. scaling applications, multi-cloud
