# Basket Case — Green Day

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUTGr5t3MoY As ever, context is everything — coming out of virtual obscurity, in an era that didn't need more punk music, Green Day mysteriously flourished, bringing musicality to a genre that rejected musicality, bringing vocal harmonies and technical proficiency and incredible raw energy. Ignore their future for a second — the messy rock opera American Idiot! And pretend 21st Century Breakdown never even existed. Alone, Dookie, coming out of left field in 1994 — it was sudden and shocking, really, truly unexpected — and lighthearted, serious topics and a tongue-in-cheek, teenagers and hell-may-care, perhaps vaguely political, vaguely disinterested in pop culture, written about the frontman's very real panic attacks and anxiety disorders, but transformed through this vibrant, vital resurgence of punk into a chart-topper.
