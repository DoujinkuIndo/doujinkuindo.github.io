Hello BlogVisitor,

I encountered a problem while accessing github. 
Just sharing how I got it fixed.

I could not access github for a while.
The chrome browser said, DNS could not resolve.
I rebooted my system. Still, the problem persisted.

[StackOverflow](https://superuser.com/questions/609587/cant-load-certain-websites-in-mountain-lion-which-load-fine-on-win7-laptop/610243#610243) came to the rescue.
DNS servers had to be set to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. They are google's dns servers.
