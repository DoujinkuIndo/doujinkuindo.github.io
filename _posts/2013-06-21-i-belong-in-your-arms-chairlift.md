# I Belong In Your Arms - Chairlift

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_aTOyFRwJ0 I see the final sentence of the Katrina and the Waves post and raise you this. If John Hughes was still making movies, this would be the opening song of his 2013 release. You may cry hipster pretention at the nonsense of the verses, but the chorus is simple, unadulterated joy. Every time this comes on shuffle I can't help but walk with a bounce.
