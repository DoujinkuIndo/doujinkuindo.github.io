# Forest

![Box Description](/images/forest/Forest.png)
This is a Windows Easy retired machine that is a good introduction to windows enumeration. It is distinct in that it doesn't contain a web server like most machines in HackTheBox. I start off with an nmap scan to see which ports are open and what services are running. My prefered method for CTFs is
**nmap -A -T4 -p- ipaddress**
