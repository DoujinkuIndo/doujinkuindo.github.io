# Forest

![Box Description](/images/forest/Forest.png)
This is an Easy Windows retired machine that is a good introduction to windows enumeration. It is distinct in that it doesn't contain a web server like most machines in HackTheBox. I start off with an nmap scan to see which ports are open and what services are running. My prefered method for CTFs is

**nmap -A -T4 -p- ipaddress**

As you can see there are a lot of ports open which is typical of windows machines. After seeing the services open I turn my focus to SMB. I run smbmap to list all shares but I am not able to view anything. It's always a good idea to use multiple tools to enumerate services whenever you can in case one doesn't work with that particular service. Neither one of them have anonymous access so I move on. If I find credentials later I can come back to try to list the shares.
