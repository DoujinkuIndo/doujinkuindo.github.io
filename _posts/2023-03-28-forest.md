# Forest

![Box Description](/images/forest/Forest.png)
This is an Easy Windows retired machine that is a good introduction to windows enumeration. It is distinct in that it doesn't contain a web server like most machines in HackTheBox. I start off with an nmap scan to see which ports are open and what services are running. My prefered method for CTFs is

**nmap -A -T4 -p- ipaddress**

Nmap Scan

As you can see there are a lot of ports open which is typical of windows machines. After seeing the services open I turn my focus to SMB.


SMB Enumeration
![smb](/images/forest/smb.png)
I run smbmap to list all shares but I am not able to view anything. It's always a good idea to use multiple tools to enumerate services whenever you can in case one doesn't work with that particular service. There is no anonymous access so I move on. If I find credentials later I can come back to try to list the shares. I next focus on LDAP which is the second lowest hanging fruit. As we can see the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is listening on a number of ports. That is an indication that this system is a domain controller.


LDAP Enumeration

I like to run this nmap script to initially enumerate LDAP before I dive in deeper.

After enumerating with ldapsearch I get a lot of information so I save it to a file to grep out useful information. A searching shorcut for useful things to look at could be

* cat filename | grep -I user
* cat filename | grep -I memberof
* cat filename | grep -I description
* cat filename | grep -I sAMAccountName
* cat filename | grep -I userPrincipalName

As you are reviewing this file look for interesting things to grep out. I found some usernames with email addresses so I will create a list.
*sebastien@htb.local
*santi@htb.local
*lucinda@htb.local
*andy@htb.local
*mark@htb.local
*Exchange_Online-ApplicationAccount@htb.local
*admin@htb.local
*administrator@htb.local

It's important to get creative with lists add first and last names if you have them. For now I will keep searching for usernames but especially service accounts. We have another service to enumerate if we have anonymous access.


RPClient
![RPC Enumeration](/images/forest/rpclient.png) "RPC Enumeration")
This port is relatively easy to enumerate and can generate a lot of useful information if anonymous access is configured which it is. We confirm the users we have but more imortantly there is one more that wasn't in our ldap enumeration. **svc-alfresco**!
