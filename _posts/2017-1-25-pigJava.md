We're at the end of week 1 - semester 2, and today we had our first programming tutorial since the winter break. While my results from semester 1 had been quite good, I still felt a little rusty, so it was good that our lecturer wasted no time on niceties and spent the entire 2 hour session covering new material, in particular, String Manipulation.

We were given an exercise sheet with 6 tasks to complete, each related to manipulating strings, and each successive task a little more challenging. I'd like to step through my solution to the first task, a program that was to take a word, and convert it to "pig latin".

The key to this problem is identifying if a word begins with a vowel or a consonant. For the former, you simply append "way" to the word, whilst for the latter you move the first letter to the end, and append "ay".

For example, James becomes amesJay, whilst Adam becomes Adamway.

```java
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;
public class pigJava
{
  public static void main(String [] args)
  {
    String userInput = "", pattern = "[a-zA-Z]{1,}";
    String firstChar = "", vowels  = "aeiou", result = "";
    boolean validInput = false;
```

I imported JOptionPane as that's how the task requested the input and output to be displayed. After that I declared a number of Strings, userInput will hold whatever string the user types at the prompt, pattern is a simple regular expression that accepts at single word with no spaces.

Then I have an empty string for putting the first letter of the word into later, another empty string for the eventual output, and a string containing all the vowels. Finally I have a boolean value, which I set to false.

The first interesting part of this task was the regular expression ```[a-zA-Z]{1,}```.

For this task, I wasn't concerned about punctuation or other special characters, so the only characters that are accepted are A through Z, both lowercase and uppercase. This is declared in ```[a-zA-Z].

Then, I wanted to only accept a single word. In this case, because the first part of the expression will exclude any non-letter characters, including spaces, for the second half of the expression I just had to specify that I wanted at least 1 letter, hence the comma after the 1 in ```{1,}```.
