Ok, I'm not accepting any Facebook invites. All
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) does for me is consume my time and I've got work to do.


[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/benhamilton) on the other hand is my online resume, it does keep me in touch with other working professionals. I often get asked "Why LinkedIn?" - well I've found this
[slideshow that details what and how you can use LinkedIn](http://www.slideshare.net/fordrm/left-out-of-linkedin-presentation/), go check it out.

If you want to connect to me via LinkedIn there are two questions I need to be able to answer first before I'll accept:*Are you (or your company) someone I know or deal with or about to deal with?


*Is there any value in us being connected?

If your invite answers those, all is good.
