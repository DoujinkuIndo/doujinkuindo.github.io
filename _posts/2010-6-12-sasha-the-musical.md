## Sasha: A Musical featuring Sasha Ayvazov and his Ensemble Friend Group

This is an old draft of a musical I wrote for an old friend's birthday. He was a very specific character (as are, I think, all of us mentioned in the musical) and, as such, seemed to require a bigger gift than the common shirt/food/music triumvirate that has served me well. It's a number of years old, but even then, it's clear how the foremost attributes of people become them as they grow older. I think teenagers often become caricatures of their earlier selves. Two, three years later, Sasha is still a nationalist, abrasive math nerd. Joe still talks about RIT. Joey uses the same sort of humor - pausing the conversation, remixing, and interjecting the change. I think it's interesting how clearly these traits were even then, with us all so young. 

## **SASHA: THE MUSICAL**

### _by James Buckland_

(Sasha and friends are gathered in his living room for his College-time going-away party.)

SASHA I really appreciate you all coming, guys. It’s been a weird couple of years, but I think I’d like to spend the last few hours enjoying all your company the best I can.

JOEY I’ll get the condoms.

FAYE Shut up, Joey.

SASHA I have a present for all of you. (pulls out microphone) I’ve recently discovered that there’s nothing I want to do more in life than sing. About my life. Which will be mostly me doing math at college. Maybe.

(Sasha’s friends are stunned speechless by the sudden appearance of red velvet curtains and a microphone stand)

SASHA I know I’m probably not the best singer, but there’s a few heartfelt things I think I want to say to you all before I leave.

> ## What Do You Do With a PhD in Math? (to the tune of ‘What Do You Do With a B.A. in English?’ from Avenue Q)
> 
> What do you do with a PhD in Math? What is my life going to be? Four years of High School, I now own a slide rule, It’s earned me this useless degree! My life has no thrills yet, I’m not off the pills yet, And college is such a big place! But somehow I can’t shake The feeling I might make, A difference when I go to space!

(limited, halting applause)

FAYE You were flat almost the entire time.

BAUMAN Wait, I thought it was sharp.

JOE I’m at college, you guys. Did you all know that? I’m at college right now.

TURTLE What in God’s name is a slide rule?

BAUMAN I think I saw one in a sex shop once.

ANEESA It’s like a calcula- oh, fuck it. Stupid Germans and their weird-ass inventions.

FAYE Actually, I thought it was Russian?

JOEY I’m Russian, you guys! Did you all know that? I’m Russian right now.

SASHA Fuck off, Joey. I’m a real Russian.

> ## Don’t Fucksi with Ruskis
> 
> Yo, hold up. Nine time zones, bitches! (don’t fuckski with the ruskis) We got Tolstoy, leave you in stitches (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Fourteen borders! (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Damn straight, we don’t take orders! (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Lemme back in– We got spaceflight first outta all mankind Feudalism? Tsars? We got a fuckin’ empire! It’s bitter cold, you can’t invade, your goddamn armies will freeze! We’ll all be toasty in fur, you’ll be succumbing to disease! We’ve got ancient cities, we’ve got works of art- We’ve got writers and poets, damn straight we’re smart! And if you fuck with us, you’ll be wrought with despair- You’ve got bullets and bombs, we’ve got fuckin’ bears! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Wait, kick it- Nuclear power, big-ass forests, oil pipelines We got a ton of natural resources we use all the time My boy Lomonosov here will kick your ass without trying Don’t mess with T-34, you’re bound to run home crying! We’ve got the Turkish, we’ve got Slavs, we’ve got a shitload of Jews We’ve got onion-dome churches, we’ve got jewel-encrusted pews. We’re fucking rolling in money, we’ve got champagne on tap. We’ve got universal health care, we’ve got universal rap! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Damn straight. Thirteen time zones, bitches! (don’t fuckski with the ruskis) We got guns, leave you in stitches (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Thirty-five borders! (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Damn straight, we giving orders! (don’t fucksi with the ruskis)

(more applause this time)

FAYE That wasn’t half bad.

ANEESA It was all bad!

(they exchange a high five)

BAUMAN Wait, I don’t get it.

SASHA Look, Joey, this is what it means to be Russian. If you’re a good writer, you commit suicide. If you’re a bad writer, the noble thing to do is stay alive as long as possible and suffer the consequences of your terrible work.

JOEY Well, I wish you a long life.

JOE Are there actually good Russian writers? I mean, I took a course at Splash this one year, and all the writers seemed like shit.

SASHA What? Russian literature is best in world!

JOE No, I’m pretty sure Japanese literature is the best in the world.

SASHA Joe, this time, you’re wrong.

> ## Joe, This Time You’re Wrong
> 
> (repeating ostenato: C#, Fm, Bb) Sasha: Joe, this time you’re wrong. There’s opinions in your head that don’t belong And though you’ll never show it We both know that you know it And you’ve carried on this fussing for too long. I’ve proved myself with the full force of logic. You’ve argued back with a failure that’s symbolic Of your lacking understanding Of a subject that’s demanding And I’d guess you’ve a disorder neurologic. (Joe: Neurological.) Sasha: [Eb] [G dim] [C] Don’t... Be... Mad... [C#maj7] [Fm] [Bb] You’re... Just... Wrong... I am baffled by complete incomprehension Our discussion, it requires your attention. But why on earth you would get mad If I defeat you, my good lad This is a subject I approach with apprehension. You always pick these fights at the wrong times, Joe. Like after I’ve finished Debate, you misapply-o Your intentions, they’re well-placed but your ultimate disgrace Is your constant and unceasing wrongness, of this I know. Don’t... Be... Mad... You’re... Just... Wrong... Joe, this time you’re wrong. There are opinions in your head, they’re drilled in strong. But your wrongness ever after it will lead to some disaster And I cannot let this threat become prolonged. So you must read all of my Russian Kindle e-Books And you must listen only to the best Journey hooks. In short, if you become like me you’ll have my solid guarantee That you’ll be smart and right and maybe have some good looks. Like me!

(riotous applause. Joe retreats into his RIT sweatshirt.)

SASHA Thank you. (takes bow)

FAYE That wasn’t so bad. I liked the part where you fought over me.

JOEY I didn’t follow your argument the entire time, Sasha.

BAUMAN I think he was arguing for Objectivism.

JOE
Nobody appreciates me.

TURTLE
That’s okay, Joe! People at college appreciate you!

(beat)

SASHA
(awkwardly moving right along) Heh, um. Well, now I’d like to present a love song to the most important guest here tonight.

(Faye stands up, blushing. Sasha pushes her back down.)

SASHA
Maths!

To Maths I’ve Loved
[Emin7] [Gdim] [G]
To Maths I’ve Loved
[G] [G/D]
When people can be negative
[F] [C]
Their emotions go askew
[G] [G/D]
I much prefer the positive
[F] [C]
I’m the absolute value
[Emin7] [Gdim]
And when the slope of my intentions seems to
[G]
go astray
[C]
And when there’s no-one else around
[C/B]
It’s time to go to town
[C/Bb]
on the good old equations of
[F]
Faraday
[Fm]
To maths
[C]
I’ve Loved
[Bb] [B]
(and Faye)
[F]
There’s nothing else for me
[Fm]
This song is for maths
[C] [Gsus] [G]
I’ve Loved
[Eb] [G]
Desire stretching out into infinity
[C]
Oh, maths, you’re the only one for me
[Eb] [G]
I adore you…
[C]
Endlessly (well, in the real number set)
[D] [F#m]
When my life is turning putrid.
[C maj7] [G]
I can always count on Euclid…
[D] [F#m]
When my friends are in a brawl.
[Cmaj7] [G]
I can count on L’Hopital…
[D] [F#m]
And when my soda’s lost its fizz.
[Cmaj7] [G]
I can turn to Leibniz…
[D] [F#m]
And when I’m all bothered and hot.
[Cmaj7] [G]
I rely on Mandelbrot…
[Fm]
Oh, math
[C]
I’m yours…
(applause. Faye takes a bow anyway.)

SASHA
You know, I still need to devise that Mandelbrot sex game…

BAUMAN
I do know. I can help with that.

JOEY
You know, Maths haven’t been the same since Pink Floyd left the Pixies. You know, in my opinion.

(Faye administers the look of disapproval)

JOE
Hey, Sasha! You know what hasn’t been the same since… well, since World War Two? Russia.

BAUMAN
I do know!

(Sasha stands up, furious)

SASHA
Take that back, Joe! Take it back right now!

JOE
Oh, you know I’m right.

JOEY
Hey, guys, I’m Russian!

JOE
See?

SASHA
Oh, I suppose not. Guess I’d better sing about it.

Fall Of The Russian Empire
[Dm] [Bb]
Russia!
[Gm] [A]
Such epic misfortune,
[Dm] [Bb]
Your populus mis-strewn
[Gm] [A]
To all of the corners of the globe
[Dm] [Bb]
Your language!
[Gm] [A]
The clearest that there is!
[Dm] [Bb]
Most logical, that it is.
[Gm] [A]
We even had the first space probe!
[Gm] [A]
Where have you gone?
[Dm7] [Bbmaj7]
Russia, it’s been so long.
[Gm] [A]
And in that time, I think I’ll find
[Dm7] [Bbmaj7]
I’ve missed you all along.
[Dm] [Bb]
Russia!
[Gm] [A]
Such brave-hearted conquest
[Dm] [Bb]
towering over the rest
[Gm] [A]
but we all knew that you would fall.
[Dm] [Bb]
Your empire!
[Gm] [A]
We all worked and aspired for you
[Dm] [Bb]
Looking round, you have tumbled, you
[Gm] [A] [Dm]
have fallen to the ground.
(quiet, lamenting applause)

SASHA
Thank you.

JOEY
Are you sure we’re talking about the same Russia? I meant the one with all the cars and shit. The one on the Discovery channel, with all the strange names and faces.

JOE
(quietly) Goddamn it.

FAYE
See, this is why education is important!

TURTLE
Why not let people have their ignorance? I mean, objectively, what is knowledge? I mean, within the ideology of Objectivism, right? Why not?

BAUMAN
I will fucking kill you.

SASHA
Education is important. Unless you’re me, in which case you already know everything. Hey, did I tell you guys I got into college? (excited responses) But I’m not going. No, good-bye, my friends. Keep in touch! I won’t be on Facebook. Or answer my phone. But it’ll still be your fault if we don’t talk for a few years. I’ve missed you already. I could go to college, meet new people, but…nope, fuck college. I’m going to space.

Fuck College, I’m Going to Space
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I got in to college.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I knew that I would do it.
[Am] [Am] [F] [F]
You bastards all will work for me some day.
[C] [G] [C] [F]
(pause)
[C] [G] [F] [F]
They said I’d never cut it.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
They said that I was unfit
[Am] [Am] [F] [F]
I turned my back on them and said ‘you’ll pay!’
[C] [G] [C] [F]
(pause)
[Em] [Em] [Eb] [Eb]
And now, my time has come.
[D7] [G]
I’m no longer running from
[C] [G] [F] [F]
all of the things that I was afraid of.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
Fuck college-
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I’m going into space.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I’m blasting off tomorrow,
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I’ll leave the world with my mistakes.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
Fuck college-
[C] [G] [F] [F]
There’s nebulae and shit!
[C] [G] [F] [F]
With galaxies, who wants four more
[C] [G] [F] [F]
whole years of this bullshit?
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I got in to college.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I guess it doesn’t matter.
[Am] [Am] [F] [F]
You bastards all will run from me one day.
[C] [G] [C] [F]
(pause)
[Em] [Em] [Eb] [Eb]
I’ll swallow all this knowledge whole
[D7] [G]
Enrich my body and my soul
[C] [G] [F] [F]
Come back and bust some hearts and minds wide open.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
Fuck college-
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I’m going into space.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
I’m blasting off tomorrow,
[C] [G] [F] [F]
leave the world with my mistakes.
[C] [G] [F] [F]
Fuck college-
[C] [G] [F] [F]
Who knows what I might find?
[C] [G] [F] [F]
Good luck, you poor sad bastards
[C] [G] [F] [F]
with the woes of all mankind!
[C]
Fuck college!
[Dm7] [Ebdim7] [Am7] [C]
(Sasha dons a jetpack and takes off through the ceiling of his living room to the weeping of his former friends.)

JOE
Hey, RIT has jetpacks!
