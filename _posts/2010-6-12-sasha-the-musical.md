# Sasha: A Musical featuring Sasha Ayvazov and his Ensemble Friend Group

This is an old draft of a musical I wrote for an old friend's birthday. He was a very specific character (as are, I think, all of us mentioned in the musical) and, as such, seemed to require a bigger gift than the common shirt/food/music triumvirate that has served me well. It's a number of years old, but even then, it's clear how the foremost attributes of people become them as they grow older. I think teenagers often become caricatures of their earlier selves. Two, three years later, Sasha is still a nationalist, abrasive math nerd. Joe still talks about RIT. Joey uses the same sort of humor - pausing the conversation, remixing, and interjecting the change. I think it's interesting how clearly these traits were even then, with us all so young.

## _by James Buckland_

## SCENE I

(Sasha and friends are gathered in his living room for his College-time going-away party.)

SASHA I really appreciate you all coming, guys. It’s been a weird couple of years, but I think I’d like to spend the last few hours enjoying all your company the best I can.

JOEY I’ll get the condoms.

FAYE Shut up, Joey.

SASHA I have a present for all of you. (pulls out microphone) I’ve recently discovered that there’s nothing I want to do more in life than sing. About my life. Which will be mostly me doing math at college. Maybe.

(Sasha’s friends are stunned speechless by the sudden appearance of red velvet curtains and a microphone stand)

SASHA I know I’m probably not the best singer, but there’s a few heartfelt things I think I want to say to you all before I leave.

> ## What Do You Do With a PhD in Math? (to the tune of ‘What Do You Do With a B.A. in English?’ from Avenue Q)
> 
> What do you do with a PhD in Math? What is my life going to be? Four years of High School, I now own a slide rule, It’s earned me this useless degree! My life has no thrills yet, I’m not off the pills yet, And college is such a big place! But somehow I can’t shake The feeling I might make, A difference when I go to space!

(limited, halting applause)

FAYE You were flat almost the entire time.

BAUMAN Wait, I thought it was sharp.

JOE I’m at college, you guys. Did you all know that? I’m at college right now.

TURTLE What in God’s name is a slide rule?

BAUMAN I think I saw one in a sex shop once.

ANEESA It’s like a calcula- oh, fuck it. Stupid Germans and their weird-ass inventions.

FAYE Actually, I thought it was Russian?

JOEY I’m Russian, you guys! Did you all know that? I’m Russian right now.

SASHA Fuck off, Joey. I’m a real Russian.

> ## Don’t Fucksi with Ruskis
> 
> Yo, hold up. Nine time zones, bitches! (don’t fuckski with the ruskis) We got Tolstoy, leave you in stitches (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Fourteen borders! (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Damn straight, we don’t take orders! (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Lemme back in– We got spaceflight first outta all mankind Feudalism? Tsars? We got a fuckin’ empire! It’s bitter cold, you can’t invade, your goddamn armies will freeze! We’ll all be toasty in fur, you’ll be succumbing to disease! We’ve got ancient cities, we’ve got works of art- We’ve got writers and poets, damn straight we’re smart! And if you fuck with us, you’ll be wrought with despair- You’ve got bullets and bombs, we’ve got fuckin’ bears! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Wait, kick it- Nuclear power, big-ass forests, oil pipelines We got a ton of natural resources we use all the time My boy Lomonosov here will kick your ass without trying Don’t mess with T-34, you’re bound to run home crying! We’ve got the Turkish, we’ve got Slavs, we’ve got a shitload of Jews We’ve got onion-dome churches, we’ve got jewel-encrusted pews. We’re fucking rolling in money, we’ve got champagne on tap. We’ve got universal health care, we’ve got universal rap! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Don’t fucksi - with the ruskis! Damn straight. Thirteen time zones, bitches! (don’t fuckski with the ruskis) We got guns, leave you in stitches (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Thirty-five borders! (don’t fucksi with the ruskis) Damn straight, we giving orders! (don’t fucksi with the ruskis)

(more applause this time)

FAYE That wasn’t half bad.

ANEESA It was all bad!

(they exchange a high five)

BAUMAN Wait, I don’t get it.

SASHA Look, Joey, this is what it means to be Russian. If you’re a good writer, you commit suicide. If you’re a bad writer, the noble thing to do is stay alive as long as possible and suffer the consequences of your terrible work.

JOEY Well, I wish you a long life.

JOE Are there actually good Russian writers? I mean, I took a course at Splash this one year, and all the writers seemed like shit.

SASHA What? Russian literature is best in world!

JOE No, I’m pretty sure Japanese literature is the best in the world.

SASHA Joe, this time, you’re wrong.

> ## Joe, This Time You’re Wrong
> 
> (repeating ostenato: C#, Fm, Bb) Sasha: Joe, this time you’re wrong. There’s opinions in your head that don’t belong And though you’ll never show it We both know that you know it And you’ve carried on this fussing for too long. I’ve proved myself with the full force of logic. You’ve argued back with a failure that’s symbolic Of your lacking understanding Of a subject that’s demanding And I’d guess you’ve a disorder neurologic. (Joe: Neurological.) Sasha: [Eb] [G dim] [C] Don’t... Be... Mad... [C#maj7] [Fm] [Bb] You’re... Just... Wrong... I am baffled by complete incomprehension Our discussion, it requires your attention. But why on earth you would get mad If I defeat you, my good lad This is a subject I approach with apprehension. You always pick these fights at the wrong times, Joe. Like after I’ve finished Debate, you misapply-o Your intentions, they’re well-placed but your ultimate disgrace Is your constant and unceasing wrongness, of this I know. Don’t... Be... Mad... You’re... Just... Wrong... Joe, this time you’re wrong. There are opinions in your head, they’re drilled in strong. But your wrongness ever after it will lead to some disaster And I cannot let this threat become prolonged. So you must read all of my Russian Kindle e-Books And you must listen only to the best Journey hooks. In short, if you become like me you’ll have my solid guarantee That you’ll be smart and right and maybe have some good looks. Like me!

(riotous applause. Joe retreats into his RIT sweatshirt.)

SASHA Thank you. (takes bow)

FAYE That wasn’t so bad. I liked the part where you fought over me.

JOEY I didn’t follow your argument the entire time, Sasha.

BAUMAN I think he was arguing for Objectivism.
