# Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want — The Smiths

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtKBwuOtntw This is an even weirder cases, a song set firmly in memory as having some sort of nebulous attachment to high school or whatever, but I can't for the life of me remember when. It's a song from an era I wasn't alive during, made famous to people other than I through a movie I haven't seen; I didn't know who the band was for ages, I didn't (don't) typically enjoy the melancholy whining that this genre presents; it's wonderful musically and endlessly listenable, addictive and short and sweet, as all the best, and it's earwormed its way into my life without context, without attached memories, without purpose, and that fascinates me.
