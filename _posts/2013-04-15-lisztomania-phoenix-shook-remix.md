# Lisztomania — Phoenix (Shook remix)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbVaJ5kl7s [Shook](https://soundcloud.com/shookshookshook) (one of my favorite remix artists) takes Phoenix's [Lisztomania](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BJDNw7o6so) and makes it more French, more disco-poppy, more dance hall, more syncopated and synth-y, more sparse and reverb, stripping it down to its minimalist essentials, the choralized vocals; it builds back up a bassline, a clav synth, and claps, and pretty much nothing else. And you get this portrait of a song which has been torn open, ribs exposed, and you can see how it works; the song swells properly as the bridge leads into the chorus; the bassline mirrors the repetitions, and the song trudges along _nn-ts, nn-ts_ like a good disco song, connecting another remix bridge between time periods, dragging the past out into the light, examining the stuff Phoenix is made of.
