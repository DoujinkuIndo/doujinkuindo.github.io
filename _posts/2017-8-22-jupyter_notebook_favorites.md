**Easily convert from Jupyter Notebook to HTML using nbconvert**

Source: https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert

*Usage:* `jupyter nbconvert --to html mynotebook.ipynb`
jupyter nbconvert --to html '"Getting text from Project Gutenberg.ipynb"

Note that nbconverter changes the format on the page it's on (like this blog), so I dont' use it here.
