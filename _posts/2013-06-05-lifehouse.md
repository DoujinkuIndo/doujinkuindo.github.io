# You and Me — Lifehouse

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac3HkriqdGQ Screw you guys, I love this song. This was a golden age — 8th grade, home early from school, using the bathroom in the deli on the corner, listening to the radio; newfound tools, finding the music online and listening to it over and over until I don't need or want to buy it, it's already within me; the chords, too young to know or understand the sequencing or intention, still able to be simply carried away by repetition and complexity, a simple guitar, simple strings, sounds I am familiar with, but captivating and smooth and easy to listen to, kind and hopeful music.
