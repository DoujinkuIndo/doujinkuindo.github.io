A story to illustrate a point:

>A young engineer was leaving the office at 5.30pm when he found the Boss standing in front of a shredder with a piece of paper in his hand.
>"Listen," said the Boss "this is a very sensitive and important document and my secretary is not here. Can you make this thing work?"
>"Certainly," said the young engineer. He turned on the machine, inserted the paper, and pressed the start button.
>"Excellent. excellent," said the Boss as his paper disappeared inside the machine, "I just need one copy."

Lesson: Never, never, ever assume that the person asking knows what they are doing.

The point here is that often when a client asks me to do X, it pays to really and truely understand what it is they are really asking for.

Thanks to Michael at [http://www.compendium.com.au/](http://www.compendium.com.au/) for passing the story onto me. Love it.
