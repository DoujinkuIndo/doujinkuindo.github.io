I am Min Shi, a Ph.D. student majoring in political science and interested in programming with Python. I also have learned about R, Stata in classes, and Java by myself. I would like to make friends with those who are also beginners in programming. We could accompany each other to learn step by step. 

My email address is  minshimiya@gmail.com, my Linkedin account is Min Shi, my facebook account is Mia Shi, and my twitter account is MinShiMia1. Please do not hesitate to contact with me if you are also interesting in programming.

You all have a nice day!
