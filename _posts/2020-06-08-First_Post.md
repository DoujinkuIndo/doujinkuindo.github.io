I am Min Shi, a Ph.D. student majoring in political science and interested in programming with Python. I also have learned about R, Stata in classes, and Java by myself. I would like to make friends with those who are also beginners in programming. We could accompany each other to learn step by step. 

Please do not hesitate to contact with me if you are also interesting in programming. You could reach out to me through email: ![_config.yml]({{ minshimiya@gmail.com }}/images/config.png) , Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/min-shi-mia , facebook: https://www.facebook.com/mia.shi.7311/, and twitter: https://twitter.com/MinShiMia1. 

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).
