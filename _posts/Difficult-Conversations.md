title: Are you having difficult conversations?
---

The best teams have difficult conversations often: from the outside it looks like they have a lot of conflict!

How often does your team have difficult discussions? It's very much a trailing metric, but if a team isn't having at least one difficult discussion per week, there are important problems not getting attention. (I got that metric from Willem Larsen.)

# What is a difficult conversation?

It will vary by team.

Consider a conversation where someone gets upset. Now imagine someone avoids bringing up a topic because they're worried someone will get upset. That topic is a difficult discussion _topic_. 

If someone is worried about bringing up such a topic, finds the wherewithal to bring it up anyway, and at the end of the discussion they are glad they brought it up, that's a successful difficult discussion.

Maybe they find someone indeed got upset, and then the group worked through the issue to the benefit of all. Or maybe no one got upset, and their fear was not borne out. Both are success.
