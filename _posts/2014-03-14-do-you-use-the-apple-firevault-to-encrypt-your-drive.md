Do you use the Apple Mac FireVault?

I'm not. At least, not yet. Given the warning it gives prior to turning it on I've not yet turned it on. Should I? or should I not?

This is the warning that appears:>WARNING: You will need your login password or a recovery key to access your data. A recovery key is automatically generated as part of this setup. If you forget both your password and recovery key, the data will be lost.


Your thoughts/input/experience appreciated.
