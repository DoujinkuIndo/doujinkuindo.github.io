##How's that Final project going?
-------------------------------------

Final's are slowly creeping up, and holy crap I'm starting to get freak out big time.  I honestly think that it's my mind making me feel this way because I really don't have a big course load.  I have 4 classes in total, CS331, CS350(retake), MATH152, and this Humanities class.  I only have 3 final exams and 2 final projects to do, but boy does it feel daunting to get all of that done.
