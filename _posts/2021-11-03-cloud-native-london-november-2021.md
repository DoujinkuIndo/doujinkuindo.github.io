We had three great speakers from Authorizon, Humio, and Ververica joining us at our November Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Netapp](https://www.netapp.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Or Weis from Authorizon discussing Permissions in your cloud-native product (starting at [29:59](https://youtu.be/KFnbDktrl64?t=1799)). His takeaways mentioned that:

* Modern applications require modern access-control
* There are 5 best practices to get permissions right today and tomorrow
* Open source Solutions like OPA, OPAL, and Zanzibar can help get permissions baked in

Then we had Bjorn Graabek from Humio saying to Log Everything! (starting at [1:00:49](https://youtu.be/KFnbDktrl64?t=3649)). He reminded us:

* Log everything!
* Although observability is the new cool kid, combine it with logging
* Humio = Speed, Scale, Low(er) Cost

Finally Seth Wiesman from Ververica wrapped up our evening with a talk on Stateful Functions: Flexible like a Microservice, Consistent like a Monolith (starting at [1:42:56](https://youtu.be/KFnbDktrl64?t=6176)). He explained that: 

* Stateful applications can be simple on Kubernetes.
* Stream processors provide the right engine for modern infrastructure.

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
