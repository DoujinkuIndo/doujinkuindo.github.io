I've been pointed to
[Michael Hyatt's site which lists the five levels of delegation](http://michaelhyatt.com/042-the-fine-art-of-delegation-part-1-podcast.html).

Level 1: Do exactly what I have asked you to do.
Level 2: Research the topic and report back
Level 3: Research the topic, outline the options and make a recommendation.
Level 4: Make a decision and then tell me what you did.
Level 5: Make whatever decision you think is best.

Interesting read. Now to apply it....
