# Until Something Breaks: Pinatas, Uneven Surfaces, and Linear Growth in Keratin

There's a bruise on my fingernail, which is an interesting place for a bruise. Normally, a bruise fades slowly, and before you know it, it's gone. Not this bruise. This is from an impact, and it's in the fingernail, staining it slightly with wood and blood. Fingernail tissue doesn't heal, of course, so the bruise has just been working its way down my finger as the nail grows out. Thus the bruise heals at a steady pace, as I clip my nails. When it's gone, I aim to have forgotten why it ever was.
