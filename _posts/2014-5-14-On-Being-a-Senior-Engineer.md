>The degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful youâ€™ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.

&mdash;John Allspaw, [On Being a Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)

So much good info about what it means to be a Senior Engineer, which John defines as achieving maturity as a developer rather than amassing technical knowledge.
