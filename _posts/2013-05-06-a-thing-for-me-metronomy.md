# A Thing For Me — Metronomy

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYB2Mqs24ss Let it never be said I don't post enough British eurotrash electrosynthpop. With the quirky bassline and the falsetto and the drumline chorus and the low baritone verses and the delightfully inventive video, it's just all too much. I can't figure out the influences; I have no idea who these guys listened to as kids, or the history of the part of England they're from, or whether the song or band has any cares beyond the stark relationship drama of the song. And maybe that's for the best — not all music is deep and thorough. This is a party song, danceable and maybe even listenable — enough new sounds to be interesting but not enough to be shocking. It's a dance around the edges of what's traditional and what's unheard of, and it does it well.
