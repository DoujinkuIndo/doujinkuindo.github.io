# The Big Sleep: Drowsyness Conclusively Prove to Lead to Shorter Sentences

Writing this on an iPod. This is a bit of a challenge. Still, I'm trying. Learned me some TextMate. Coda 2. Project Euler, CSS and Wordpress plugins. Setting up an FTP site Friday. I'm learning. Why wait for anew computer when this stuff is so easy on the processor? _The Dark Tower_ is taking a hold on me deep. Starting really to scare. The Nook helps. Sudden page turns. No sense of bookishness. Can't cast it away violently if need be. Max and I wrote [music](http://www.soundcloud.com/jamesbuckland/continental-shift-feat-rax) today. he got lyrics. I sampled. Good stuff, honest and creative and with no sense of dignity. I like how this thing makes me type. Short and sweet.
