title: February 8, 2020 Recording Bird Sounds
---

Birds sing and call frequently and going out birding is often more about listening than seeing - especially when the leaves are out.
I enjoy listening to the birds and trying to understand what bird is making the sounds and why. Sometimes when one hears a bird sound, that
is often an indication that something interesting is happening.

For example, I heard a group of crows very angrily calling from a cedar tree. When I looked in the tree, I saw that they were mobbing a Great-Horned Owl.

While walking the dog this week I hear three Red-Tailed Hawks making a [racket](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/208026241)

I am not sure exactly what the hawks were doing but given that large birds are already starting to establish breeding territories, I wonder
whether this was either a territorial dispute, or perhaps something related to courtship. I'll keep an eye for a nest in this area in the next few
months.

I also like recording the bird sounds and this post is to give a brief introduction of how I do this.

## Recording devices

I use both my smart phone, for example to record those hawks, and a built-to-purpose recording device. Each has advantages.

### Recording with a smart phone

Recording with a smartphone works well. Here are some advantages

* Usually one has their smartphone with them!
* The user interface is probably going to be easier
* Its easy to add notes about the recording with the cellphone.

I just use the built in microphone, but one can add external microphones.
One does need a sound recording app.

### A build-to-purpose recording device

There are many out there ranging from less than $100 (such as mine) to $,000s.

* The recording quality can be better
* You can save your smartphone battery or use it for something else
