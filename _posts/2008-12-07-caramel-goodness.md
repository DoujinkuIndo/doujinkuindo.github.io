I recall watching my mother make caramel by boiling a can of condensed milk, but do you think I can find ANYWHERE on the 'net that tells me how to do so? nope. Seems everyone is afraid of exploding cans. Managed to find some stories of cans having exploded and the resultant mess.

Thusly, here are two links to
[making caramel](http://www.recipelink.com/mf/0/40291) with
[condensed milk](http://allrecipes.com.au/recipe/9055/caramel-slice.aspx) that doesn't involve boiling the can.
