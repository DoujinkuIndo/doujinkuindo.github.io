# Suit & Tie — Justin Timberlake

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsUsVbTj2AY When you have a hammer... This music is _candy_. So I was thrilled and disjointed at the [2:32 mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0umrvtA_pNc) on his SNL performance, when the song breaks momentarily into... another song. The horn riff is only four notes long, and somehow it implied a whole other song. I think it's a 1970s funk song, but I checked all the ones I'm super familiar with. I checked the funk compilations I have, I checked with other people with musical memories, I checked everywhere. It sounds like the start to the platonic ideal of a 1970s song, but I don't know if it really exists... And the song rushes on. Later, listening to the real version, not the SNL version, I recognize the riff as something only his voice does; that's where I was recognizing the horn riff from. The song was copying itself, and my ear heard it as copying something more original. I was totally wrong — it was JT the whole time. I think that's a high form of compliment.
