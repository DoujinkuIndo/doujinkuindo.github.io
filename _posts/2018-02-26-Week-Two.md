title: Week Two in Review
---

Week two felt a bit slower than week one, probably in part due to the time I spent working through the online training, and also becuase I was sick :mask: I still got some good things done though, and learnt a lot!

## Goals

#### Get better at JUnit

Pretty much all of the coding I've done this week has revolved around writing tests, so I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with JUnit now. I've also learnt some things a little more advanced than `assertEqual` as well, like using the in-built rules to create temporary folders to use in testing i/o. There's still definitely a lot more for me to learn, but I feel like I know enough to actually write the tests I need without it taking longer than writing the program itself!

#### Learn vim

The crash-course Jonathan gave me was fantastic. I've used vim a bit over the week (e.g. to make and edit a _gitIgnore_ file for my coding challenge) and I managed the tasks without needing to look anything up which is a **huge** step up from where I was before. I still need to think about what I'm doing though, so I definitely need more practice before I can say that I'm able to use vim competently. That will come with time though, so long as I make sure to use it when I can. I have also made sure to not change from the defaults _too_ much (my _vimrc_ contains mainly some formatting nicities) so that I learn the full, proper commands first rather than relying on shortcuts. I may look into shortcuts later once I'm comfortable with the defaults, but for now I need to be able to use vim on whatever computer I pick up (or server I ssh into).

## Tasks

#### Payslips coding exercise (again)

I refactored my solution and had a second code review with my mentors. They suggested that I move my new i/o methods into a seperate class, which would improve the program structure and cohesion, and make testing a lot easier. I have started working on implementing this and writing more tests, and am looking forward to having another code review in our next meeting.

As Elliott said, it's been very useful to see my inital bad solution, and then work towards a good solution. It has shown me what not to do and **why** it's wrong, and then what the right way to do it is and why it's better. It's a lot more valuable than just being shown what the right way is straight out, since it makes the concepts a lot more concrete and meaningful.

#### Vim

As a spoke about above, I feel like I can **use** vim now, but I still need a lot of practice to be comfortable and quick with it. The one-on-one crash course with Jonathan was a fantastic way to learn it though, since he took me through the commands he uses regularly. He also gave me some useful formatting settings to add to my _vimrc_, and ended up teaching me some other commandline things in the process too. Overall it one of the most useful hours I've spent here so far. I also found that writing the blog post summary of the session helped me to revise and remember the commands; I took notes during the session, so writing the blog post forced me to revise them and make them neater.

#### Git basics workshop

This workshop was going over the **very** basics of git. While it was useful for getting everyone on the same page (my uni certainly didn't teach git) and was well-delivered, I didn't get much out of it since I'm already comfortable with the vast majority of those commands. I did take the time to look up some of the more advanced commands I want to learn though (such as manipulating branches from the commandline: creating, destorying, merging, rebasing), which was good. I think I shuld make some time to practice these (in a project set up for practice) so that I can remember them better. This might also be a good chance to practice vim since I would need to modify files in order to generate conflicts etc.

#### Online training

I spent some time this week going through the online training (privacy, OH&S, equal opportunity, etc). It was pretty tedious, but **is** things that everyone needs to know. At least it was in comic form, not just huge walls of text like I've had in the past.

#### _New Programmer's Survial Manual_ book chapters 2 and 3



#### Code Retreat



#### Ongoing task: practice touch typing
