All of my blogs eventually die of inactivity (from my side).
That's why I'll be using this mostly as a lookup page for
all the other sites I participate at (see links in the footer).

On a side note, this whole Jekyll + GitHub Pages thing seems very nice.
Although I do prefer [AsciiDoctor](https://asciidoctor.org) to Markdown,
so I'll probably look around for something similar that can parse AsciiDoc.
