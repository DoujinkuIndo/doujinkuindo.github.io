I can't recall which web site I found this via, and have not had time to play further with it, but it looks very interesting: that is tweaking the settings to [mimimise network traffic caused by "Server Message Block (SMB)" with Windows Explorer](http://blogs.technet.com/askperf/archive/2007/09/21/windows-explorer-and-smb-traffic.aspx).

If anyone has used these tweaks, I'd like to hear what your experience has been.
