If like me you work in the online world, you could be forgiven for thinking that an avatar is a picture or photograph used to represent yourself in online communities.

Yet, every definition I've found lists another, older definition in first place, and I found this interesting...

The
[wikipedia disambiguation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%28disambiguation%29) page, the
[Google define:avatar](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&defl=en&q=define:avatar&ei=I_AtS8PWD4yTkAWh29HyCA&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title&ved=0CAcQkAE) &
[dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/avatar) pages and more all say this of the word Avatar:>the manifestation of a Hindu deity (especially Vishnu) in human or superhuman or animal form.

Who knew huh?
