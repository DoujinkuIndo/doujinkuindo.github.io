Weighted Dice might be a fun program to model distributions. I am sure it exists online, but I'll take it on as a project in p5.js so that I can do a better job teaching it on Outschool.

First I'll consider the objects in this interactive.
- Dice (sides, weights)
- Frequency Chart / Histogram
- Classic Distributions
- Roll, and simulate many rolls
