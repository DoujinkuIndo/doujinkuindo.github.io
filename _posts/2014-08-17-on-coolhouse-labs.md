## A Startup Accelerator Somewhere Near Nowhere

Through getting an offer to work as a developer at Leasemaid, I found myself driving up 6 hours from Chicago to Harbor Springs, MI. This town of a little more than 1100 people is where the startup accelerator known as Coolhouse Labs resides. I have spent more than two months here and am absorbing many ideas and exposing myself to different aspects of the startup world:

## Development Not As An Isolated Process

At Dev Bootcamp, web development is taught as a means to acquire a job. Thus, our exposure is narrowed to what is needed to learn how to effectively build programs. Here, I am constantly exposed to the plethora of things that an entrepreneur must concern him/herself with in order for their startup to succeed. I'm learning the incredible importance of web design and how closely it is tied to the success of both development and, more importantly, the success of the company. I am beginning to understand how a team must distribute its work to accomplish the most. I have spent many evenings discussing the viability of different startups, how reasonable their revenue streams are, and whether there would be real interest from customers.

I have listened to many lectures from successful entrepreneurs and what they found to be the most important factors to their success. Above all, I find myself thinking of all sorts of potential ideas that I can eventually start pursuing. This flurry of thought has fueled my entrepreneurial spirit which i intend to bring back with me.
