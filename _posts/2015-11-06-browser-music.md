title: Vivaldi, Opera's Music Brother
---

Chrome is a great browser, and like many people I haven't often strayed from the warm, all-knowing embrace of Google. When I heard about Vivaldi I was excited by its promise of extensive customization and many additional features. Made by many of the people who worked on Opera, Vivaldi promises a similar goal of power and privacy.

I've been using it for a little while now and this is what I like so far:

# Quick Commands

For everyone who has used Sublime Text or Atom, `ctrl/cmd+p` opens a powerful multi-tool for navigation and command execution in Vivaldi. The combination brings up what Vivaldi calls *Quick Commands*, which matches on all of your open tabs for easy switching, as well as searching Vivaldi commands. It also replaces the url bar by searching for queries using your default search engine, and also following urls.

I haven't had to use the address bar in a while and it is pretty useful so far having all of this functionality in one place.

## Web Panels

When you open Vivaldi's side panel, which defaults to the left side of the browser, you have the option of configuring notes, email (coming soon), and my favourite, web panels.

Web panels are basically separate web pages that you can tell it to render in a smaller column view. It works similar to a background tab which is brought to the foreground when you toggle them open in the side panel. It works really well for any responsive sites, and I've found it handy for social network sites like facebook or twitter, which I have as separate web panels that I can open on command with different keyboard shortcuts. This brings me to another point, all of Vivaldi's ccustomization strengths.

## Lots of Customization

The settings let you setup lots of shortucts for tabbing and navigation. All of the UI components can be toggled on and off with shortcuts, such as the sidebar, address bar, and tabs. They can also all be positioned on whichever edges of the screen you prefer.

## Speed Dial

Vivaldi has a default page similar to Opera with your favorite sites. While all browsers have some form of this page, I like the way Vivaldi has done it with easy to navigate and customizable groups of sites, and a convenient method of adding new pages with recommendations.

## Page Splitting

Ever had to open to instances of Chrome and had to split one instance on the left of the screen and one instance on the right? You probably have, because seeing two pages at once is often really useful. Vivaldi feels the same way, and has built split pages right into the browser. You can group tabs by dragging one on top of the other, and then split them horizontally or vertically within a single instance of the browser. I haven't played around with how many tabs you can have grouped, but for my wide-screen monitor seeing three split vertical tabs was about the sweet spot.

## Spatial Navigation

By default, holding shift and moving the arrow keys around allow you to zip from link to link without having to leave the keyboard. The spatial navigation built in to Vivaldi will search for links on the current page and let you move in any direction around the page until you get to the one you want. I'd really like the ability to jump to the link I want by matching on what I type on the page, but using the arrow keys has been a handy middle-ground.

Overall, the user interface is just really clean and the customization really let's you make the browser your own.

## But is it Fast?

Interface and features aside, a slow browser isn't going to attract many users, no matter how many tools it has. Vivaldi isn't as quick as Chrome, but is definitely usable. The develoeprs have also promised to dedicate more time to improving performance now that most of the core features are finished.

## Conclusion

Am I going to keep using it? For now at least, yeah! I've been using it for about a week now and there hasn't been any major problems that have me running back to Chrome. The browser has only just released its beta and while there are sure to be some hiccups, it's already pretty polished.

If you want to give it a go, it's available [here](https://vivaldi.com) on Windows, Mac and Linux. I've been using it on Ubuntu and so far it has been running smoothly.
