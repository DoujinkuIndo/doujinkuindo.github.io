# Conclusion 

The STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model offers a comprehensive approach to developing secure software. By combining the strengths of the STRIDE and DREAD models, developers are able to assess and address both the likelihood and impact of threats in a balanced fashion, enabling them to develop more secure applications.

The STRIDE/DREAD hybrid model provides a high-level framework for designing secure applications and can be broken down into smaller components in order to drill down into the details. Developers can use the model to identify threats, evaluate their risks, and create strategies for mitigating them. Additionally, developers can use the model to create comprehensive tests for debugging applications for security flaws. 

The STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model is an effective tool for software designers and developers looking to create secure applications and systems. By using this model effectively, they can create secure applications that protect their users and data from malicious actors.
