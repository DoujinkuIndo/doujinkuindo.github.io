The Tyrus Team has just released [Tyrus](https://github.com/tyrus-project/tyrus) 1.10 (JSR 356 Reference Implementation). With only a few fixes, this release could be seen as a minor one. It is however an important milestone as it is the first Tyrus release that passes the [Autobahn Testsuite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite), a test harness used to verify WebSocket client and server implementations for specification conformance and implementation robustness.

In this release, the Tyrus Team has also introduced 2 new samples that explore ways of sharing data between JavaScript and Java.
