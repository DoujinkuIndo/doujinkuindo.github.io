You may remember this set from the Park, Oh, Jo text from this week.  

1. Building a Character-net based on social relationships among characters.
 
2. Classifying role classes as major, minor or extra according to the centrality of a character in a Character-net.
 
3. Detecting sequences via the community clustering in a Character-net.

But what does it mean?  Well, It is how you would analyze video.  I am not sure what anyone else's technique is, but I feel that mine is the most fun, at least for the first marathon long run of watching media that is.  But is there any other way?  No. Not really.  You can watch anything all day long, but if you do nothing with what you saw, it is only entertainment.  

Let's be honest, there is so much more to videos, just as much, if not more than to books.  They add the whole image part of it.  With this, we can do the above not by just reading it, but by seeing it ourselves and seeing how someone else thought it should look like.  I am a firm believer that every person will interpret something differently, and I love seeing how someone else does.  

However, total downside to video analysis is just how long it all takes to do.  "ain't nobody got time for that" lol
