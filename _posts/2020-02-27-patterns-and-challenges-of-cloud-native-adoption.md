I had a great time at Cloud Native Prague, live polling the audience and comparing how Prague is adopting cloud native with the CNCF Survey 2019.

* As cloud native becomes mainstream, deployments are getting larger across a range of metrics - number of containers, machines and clusters.

* Top benefits are faster deployment (releasing daily or weekly instead of monthly or quarterly) and improved scalability.

* Top challenges with cloud native are cultural changes, security and complexity.
