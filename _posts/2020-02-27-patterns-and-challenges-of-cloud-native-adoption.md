I had a great time at Cloud Native Prague, live polling the audience and comparing how Prague is adopting cloud native with the CNCF Survey 2019. As it was the first anniversary, the organizers even invited me to blow out a candle on a cake!

Takeaways from my talk / discussion:

* As cloud native becomes mainstream, deployments are getting larger across a range of metrics - number of containers, machines and clusters.

* Top benefits are faster deployment (releasing daily or weekly instead of monthly or quarterly) and improved scalability.

* Top challenges with cloud native are cultural changes, security and complexity.
