Two pages I've found useful when playing with GRUB (a Boot loader that allows you to choose between multiple operating systems on boot up) are these:

- [The GRUB Manual](http://www.linuxselfhelp.com/gnu/grub/html_chapter/grub_12.html#SEC39)

- [The GRUB page](http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm#Temporarily_Edit_the_GRUB_Menu) - particularly this one on temporarily editing a GRUB menu item

It is nice to be able to re-order the menu items, change the length of time the menu stays on screen and change the wording of each entry.
