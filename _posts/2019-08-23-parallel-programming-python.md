I did a talk on Parallel Processing in Python at the Singapore Python User Group meetup on 27 Aug 2019 at Zendesk. It was my first time speaking at a public meetup with mostly strangers in the audience, so I was expecting a relatively small crowd of around 50 people with data science/analytics background to turn up.

As it turns out:

1. There were more than 150 (?) people in the audience (I was expecting a much cosier crowd, so I got a bit nervous),
2. Only 20 out of the 150+ people in the audience were from data science/analytics background, and;
3. There were a few interesting questions on I/O and threads raised during Q&A, and a few people stayed around to ask further questions.
