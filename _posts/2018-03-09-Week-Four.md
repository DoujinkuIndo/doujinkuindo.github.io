title: Week Four in Review
---

This week has felt quite short, since three full days were taken up by workshops. Which has created a strange paradox in that I feel like I've learnt a lot, but not got much at all done. I think in future I'd prefer to spread things out a bit, but all the workshops were quite useful.

## Goals

#### Use more hotkeys

I haven't been doing much typing this week (see above note re: workshops), but I have found that using an external keyboard has helped me to use more hotkeys. Since I have to keybaord positioned in front of my laptop, and I use the touchpad rather than the mouse, it makes using the cursor just inconvenient enough that I natually use the keyboard as much as possbile instead. I also find this much less frustrating than e.g. banning myself from using the mouse at all. I think I will keep this setup for a few more weeks and then review how I'm going with using hotkeys.

#### Practice git and vim commands

Once again I simply didn't get to this goal due to lack of time. I think I will push it to next week again, but this time make it a priority.
