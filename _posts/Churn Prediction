I analyzed subscriber data for a small edtech startup and am sharing my work. Please get in touch with comments if you are interested in learning more with me.

# Goal
In our initial discovery meeting we identified the major goal for this project, **Increase monthly retention.** 
I set out to predict churning behavior and identify factors relating to churn.

## Questions
[What does our retention rate look like?] (#retention)
[What indicates possible churn?] (#features)
[Can we predict who will/won’t churn?] (#prediction)

### Marketing Example
If people who engage in [specific user behavior] are more likely to be retained, find subscriber who hasn’t engaged in [specific user behavior] and is likely to churn - send them an email to have them try that out, since that correlates with them staying longer.

# Retention <a name="retention"></a>
First, I cleaned Mixpanel data of aggregate events per unique user. Events were selected by the product team as events that play a role in user engagement and highlight the core value of the product.
Cleaning involved NAs, outliers, and incorrect labels. Some issues include erroneous subscription periods, special accounts, and active subscribers labeled as churned. Notice how the correlation plot varied between raw and cleaned data:

The team believes that users are dropping off after first few months. To test this claim I visualized the subscription durations for users labeled as churned or not.

Users who churn, usually do so early on.
![density sub duration](/images/churnDensitybySubDuration.jpeg)
Usually in months 1, 2, and 3.
![density sub duration 5mo](/images/churnDensitybySubDuration5mo.jpeg)
Particularly after 1-month.



Retention rate = retained subscribers per month / total previous month subscribers

I'd like to attribute much of the code and thought that went into this churn investigation to reddit user emarkou (Eleni Markou) whose [4-part blog series](https://www.blendo.co/blog/predicting-churn-email-unsubscribe/) was enlightening and her code is on [github](https://github.com/blendo-app/NBD-Pareto-churn-model)
