The CNCF End User Community present the November edition of the [CNCF End User Tech Radar](http://radar.cncf.io/), the quarterly report that shows what end users really use and recommend.

I lead a panel discussion with the Radar team covering what they expected going in and what they found most interesting or surprising.

Panellists:
* Jackie Fong, Ticketmaster
* Mya Pitzeruse, Indeed
* Sma√Øne Kahlouch, Dailymotion
