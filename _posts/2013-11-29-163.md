# 163

I deleted your text messages. I had one hundred and sixty-three messages saved from nearly three years, from 2010 to 2013. I went through them each on the subway and individually unlocked and deleted them. Each deletion was a rote mechanical sequence of key presses, but the phone was slow and it took time to load and execute. So I read each text message, all one hundred and sixty-three in a row. I’d never done that, and I’ll never do it again.

When it was done, I loaded up your name on my phone to see the record of our messages. The memory bank of one hundred and sixty-three messages which I used to consult when I was lonely, sad, or needed guidance or reaffirmation had been deleted, but there were still messages there. They must have been stored all together in memory, because under your name were one hundred and sixty-three other saved text messages, all from other people. The ones I’d saved without romantic connotations — addresses, notes, forgotten inside jokes, picture messages, recipies. All waiting there under your name, where I used to go for consultation.

That’s gotta count for something.
