title: Stimulus 2: Electronic Shopping Boogaloo

> > I used the first stimulus check to buy my Mavic Air 2. With another $600 on the way, I thought I'd compile a huge list of links for possible ways to enjoy this christmas bonus. Note that all links below may support me.

### Stimulus Shopping list for media & audio supplies

### Audio

The thing I need more than anything right now is a lavalier microphone for better audio when I take videos. A few months ago I ordered a lav mic - the Movo brand, and it was so terrible I returned it after one use. With two microphones, you would expect Person 1 to be on Channel 1, and Person 2 to be on Channel 2. With the Movo, Person 1 and 2 were on Channel 1, so there was no way to isolate the sound. Imagine doing an interview, but when one person is talking you can hear the other person breathing or drinking water. This Comica has good reviews and I was really impressed with the sound quality and the range. I'll be buying this and have about $300 leftover.

This will allow me to set my phone up on a tripod, mic myself up, connect my tablet to my drone, and fly while doing commentary/voiceover.

### FPV

I am currently extremely interested in flying Freestyle FPV. My Mavic Air 2 is an awesome drone for what it was designed for - cinematic footage and photography. The world of freestyle FPV and drone racing is a completely different ball game. You are getting as close to your subjects as possible and doing flips and acrobatics. You've probably seen JohnnyFPV on youtube -- that style of flying looks like so much fun and it just isn't possible with the Mavic. My drone automatically stabilizes very well, and it is simply impossible to do flips. Plus the FPV drones are cheaper, and you are guaranteed to crash your drone flying in this style.

#### FPV Controller:

There are a few components to an FPV setup. The first that comes to mind for me is the controller, also known as the Radio. An FPV controller is different than the mavic-style controller, because the left stick is not centered. On FPV the left up-and-down stick movement controls Throttle, not Altitude, so default it stays all the way down and the throttle defaults to off. The Altitude defaults to hold-altitude (center), but you can go up or down, but it is spring-loaded to recenter and maintain altitude but you can go in either direction up or down with the left control stick. At any rate, after much research the FrSky Taranis X9D is the controller I think I should purchase. This controller is one of many controllers that are fully integrated with the Drone Racing Simulator, so I can practice flying my drone, without flying my drone. And I can fly at night and when it is cloudy, allowing me to practice 24/7. This controller could connect to any drone and flight goggles. Fully featured, many racers are using this and this model has been around a long time - there are many mods to do to it and there's a huge community to support this controller.

Just to show you some options, I linked the DJI controller below as well. This controller would come with the DJI FPV everything-pack, which is $1,000, or it can be purchased individually. I simply don't like the look of it, it is more expensive, and it doesn't have years of community support.

#### FPV Goggles:

The next thing needed for an FPV setup are the goggles. Choosing a unit has been pretty tough for me, but I have some contenders. Most likely what I end up getting will depend on my budget. With no budget, I wouldn't hesitate to get the DJI Digital FPV goggles. Digital FPV (as opposed to Analog FPV) has a much higher range, higher video quality in your goggles, and just seems like the new thing that eventually most people will have, IMO. There is a module that you can install into your goggles to make them backwards compatible with analog drones which is absolutely something I would do, and I would want to get different antennaes. It is also reccomended to get a different head strap. This whole setup would run over $700.

This is another brand option for high-end goggles. Fat Shark seems to be a trusted brand for some time now, and the Fat Shark HDO goggles seem to be a very popular choice. Clearly they are doing something right. However, they are not that much cheaper than DJI and when you add all the accessories it is still above $700, and that doesn't include a battery.

With the Eachine EV800D I can have a functioning pair of FPV goggles, which will be great for starting, especially at a price point of $130. I will be limited on my range and really won't be able to fly that well according to some of these FPV racers. I imagine flying well to be defined as
