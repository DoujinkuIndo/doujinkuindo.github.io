title: Boosting your impact - best global health journals (2017).
---
The impact factor (IF) of an academic journal is a metric used to reflect the yearly average number of citations per article published. It is often used as a proxy for the importance of a journal within its field, with journals having a higher impact factor deemed to be more important than those with lower ones.

Generally, a journals impact factor influences an authors decisions to submit, and publishing within more renowned journals tends to influence a researchers credibility. Impact factors change yearly, as journals either increase their impact - publishing highly citable papers, or decrease their impact - with less influential papers being published that year. 

Here, I have assembled a list of 163 journals which publish research related to global health and epidemiology. I compare reported impact factors for 2017 with those for 2016 to highlight key journals to aim for this year. I create a ranking system which accounts for both 2016 and 2017 impact factors, and highlight journals which appear to be rising amongst the ranks. 

**Top 10 global health journals (2017):**

1. New England Journal of Medicine **(79.258)**
2. The Lancet **(53.254)**
3. JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association **(47.661)**
4. Nature **(41.577)**
5. Nature Reviews Genetics **(41.464)**
6. Science **(41.058)**
7. Nature Medicine **(32.621)**
8. Nature Reviews Microbiology **(31.851)**
9. Nature Genetics **(27.125)**
10. Nature Methods **(26.919)** 

We don't see any change among which journals feature in the top 10 in either 2017 or 2016, however, there's a slight shift in order of the above, with Nature claiming 4th spot, where Nature Reviews Genetics was previously, and also a switch of Nature Reviews Microbiology and Nature Genetics, with Nature Reviews Microbiology claiming 8th place in 2017 vs 9th place in 2016.

**Most improved global health journals (2017, up and coming):**

1. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology **(5.829)** (rank change from 95 to 55)
2. Epidemics **(3.364)** (rank change from 132 to 97)
3. Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease **(4.45)** (rank change from 104 to 73)
4. Bayesian Analysis **(2.342)** (rank change from 159 to 134)
5. Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene **(2.82)** (rank change from 133 to 110)
6. Genetic Epidemiology **(2.544)** (rank change from 143 to 123)
7. Environmental Health **(4.376)** (rank change from 93 to 76)
8. Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing **(3.14)** (rank change from 120 to 103)
9. American Journal of Public Health **(4.38)** (rank change from 91 to 75)
10. International Journal of Infectious Diseases **(3.202)** (rank change from 117 to 101)

We show that Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology is the most improved journal in 2016, rising from rank 95 to rank 55, with an IF change from 3.719 in 2016 to 5.829 in 2017.
