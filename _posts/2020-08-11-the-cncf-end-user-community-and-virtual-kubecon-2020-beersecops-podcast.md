A slightly late posting of my episode of the BeerSecOps podcast, where Stephen Giguere and I talk about the CNCF End User Community and the Tech Radar.

> Cheryl Hung (@oicheryl) has recently been promoted to the CNCF's VP of Ecosystem after growing their end user community into the largest of of any open source foundation or standards body. In this episode she speaks to Steve Giguere (@_SteveGiguere_) about the creation of community, the results of her latest initiative in the space called the CNCF Technology Radar, and of course the upcoming Virtual KubeCon 2020.
