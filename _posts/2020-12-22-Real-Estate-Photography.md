> My camera-in-the-sky can capture incredible images of properties. This page is a photo album from one location. **Photos may take some time to load**

### From above:

If you need aerial photos, I can produce images like these. I can review the photos as I take them, and make sure I have exactly what I need by the end of the shoot. I have 3 batteries which last 30 minutes each, and I would review footage between each battery. To shoot photos on your location requires an hour and a half to two hours on site.

### From From any height:

I can get a clear shot of your property from any height, up to **400 feet** above ground level. I can also take photos from near the ground, or even on the ground if desired. It's a pretty fantastic camera at 48MP.

### From From any angle:

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/sunnyside_2.jpg?raw=true" style="max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%"/>

I can get a clear shot of your property from any angle, and actually, all angles.

### in Panoramic mode:

I can capture both your property, and the view from your property in a single photo by using the Panoramic Mode on my drone. This holds the position of the drone while the drone takes a series of photos from different angles and then stiches them together. It can also do 360-degree VR Photos, like in [google street view](https://www.google.com/streetview/).

> I am a carpenter, and the photos on this page are from a ten minute flight session while I was on my lunch break. Let me use all 3 batteries (90 minutes) on my drone at your location, and I can get excellent photos of your property! Thank you.
