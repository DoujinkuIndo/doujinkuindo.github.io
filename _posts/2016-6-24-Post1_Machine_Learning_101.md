title: What is Machine Learning ?
---
Machine learning(ML) - a buzz word that has been making people wonder what it is really about. 
Especially the products and announcements from big companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon regarding 
Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence etc have piqued interest in all of us. 
Not just Machine Learning, but also other fields like Data mining, Big Data, 
Predictive analytics has become very popular in the last decade. 
Although they all might appear as
separate fields on their own, they revolve around a central idea which is nothing but _'Dealing with Data'_. 
The main reason behind their advancements are 
the computing technologies (GPU) and Big Data technologies (Apache Spark, Hadoop lineage) in handling and
processing large amounts of data.



This blog post deals with the following:

- Explains the term 'Machine Learning' in lay man terms
- Shows simple examples, their solutions using ML and underlying concepts
- Classic definition of ML
- Application of ML

When put in simple words, ML is '_Making the machines to learn using data_'. 
Such simple definition may be daunting and seem cloudy at first. 
Eventually, with just few examples, things will be clear to everyone.

Example 1: Let's take a simple scenario. I like playing Football in the outdoors.

is a tough decision to make. With the experience in the last few years, I have made few observations 
which are summarized in the table shown below.


With such data being available, let's try to create a decision tree which helps me to
For instance, I would not go to play if it is cloudy or rainy.
