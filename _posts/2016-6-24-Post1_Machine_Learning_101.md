title: What is Machine Learning ?
---

Machine learning - a buzz word that has been making people wonder what it is really about.
And the fact that many big companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon have huge investments in this area,
has piqued interest in people about this. Not just machine learning, but also other terms like data mining, big data, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence has become very popular  in the last decade. Nevertheless, all these fields revolve around a central idea which is 'dealing with data'. When put in simple words, it is 'making the machines to learn using data'. Such simple definition may be daunting and seem cloudy at first. Eventually, with just simple examples, this makes sense to everyone.

Example 1 - Weather in KÃ¶ln and the type of dress you want to wear. Some simple scenarios and a simple decision tree to make such a simple decision.

Formal definition : ''

Example 2 - A simple OR function and a simple plane separating data points.
