# Ezekiel 7 and the Permanent Efficacy of Grace — The Mountain Goats

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-zZJu6LKI I often find my ability to communicate what I hear in this sort of music outpaced — there are so many things here that are transplendent, holy and quiet and surreal and perfect, not peaceful and not even polished, but... evocative, perhaps. Piano is better at it than acoustic guitar is better at it than most everything else — it pauses you where you are and makes you listen, it can't be danced to, albiet slow danced. What it's about matters, but not right now. Maybe on the fourth or fifth listening, it'll matter.  It's not happy or sad; it's contemplative, low-tempo, and very present, written and performed with care. This is music that lasts, written without urgency, but about pressing issues, with a driving need. Perhaps to communicate, perhaps to purge.
