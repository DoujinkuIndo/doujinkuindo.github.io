I just saw
[Dan York](http://www.disruptiveconversations.com/) (via
[twitter](http://twitter.com/danyork)) point to a Fast Company article about "
[The Ultimate Calling Card](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/83/callingcard.html)" - which I found interesting - nothing really new but worth pointing to anyhow.

I've often thought of writting a book, but finding the time, or more precisely, taking time away from other activities, is the most difficult part of the equation. Perhaps I should take the advice I heard some time ago: "15 minutes per day, every day". Hmmm....
