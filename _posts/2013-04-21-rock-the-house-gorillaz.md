# Rock the House — Gorillaz

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRlmM88zzbY I recently posted about [Nujabes' ](http://www.jbuckland.com/blog/thank-you-feat-apani-b-nujabes/)_[Thank You](http://www.jbuckland.com/blog/thank-you-feat-apani-b-nujabes/), _which also samples [John Dankworth:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydMw4zor9iE) here, it's much more obvious. I'm more taken aback by the different contexts and how they change the sample. The former makes it sound very jazzy, smooth and laid-back; the processing on the latter makes it sound more funky and up-beat. I have lots to say about Gorillaz — the popularization of sample-based music, brilliant lyrics and a subtle multimedia experience which never quite came to fruition; a race-blind hip-hop; the combination of what seems like kids' animation with adult content; and, in particular, the role of the band _Blur. _I think I just said most of it, though, so... yeah. Enjoy this weird, weird video.
