# Commuter Rail

I’ve taken the train one stop too far into the suburbs. The train cuts a furious southwest path through suburb and town, frozen pond and frosted tree. My commuter rail brethren are too old, too jaded, but I look out the window to see a fresh and clean landscape. The sky and lands are one shade of white, racing past into a blur, expressionism made real. With every minute, the train carries me further and further and further from the platform which I should have gotten off at, the platform at which I am being waited for.

It’s Christmas Day, but there are no decorations up. It’s something like ten below. I’m wearing the bundlings-up of a middle-schooler raiding his father’s closet for the warmest gear imaginable. It’s too cold for decorations. That can wait for mid-afternoon, when the trickling heat from the sun brings it up to at least freezing. Only then will the merry folk of the East Coast will venture cautiously from their homes onto the unplowed roads to purchase tinsel and bells, stockings and cider.

That evening, instead of going home, we take the train up to Connecticut — only it isn’t that evening, it’s Christmas Eve a year later, or earlier, I’m not sure. It’s a big house, full of baking equipment and instruments and light, with two dogs like bears waddling from room to room, showing us who’s boss. One dog sits on each foot, and they stare up at you, panting with dreary affection, rendering you immobile, if only for the moment. We all sleep in a pile in the living room that night, ten or twelve of us lost in dream, altogether.

Another Christmas Eve, or maybe New Years. Two years out. A small apartment in upstate Connecticut. The two large dogs have been replaced by a small, deaf, and dumb Dachshund, waddling from room to room, bumping into things. We order out for pizza, scarf it down while Die Hard rages on in the background. The five of us watch Die Hard and play video games into the early morning. I try to text you when the ball dropped, but I never did.

The dogs change, the house changes, the people change.
