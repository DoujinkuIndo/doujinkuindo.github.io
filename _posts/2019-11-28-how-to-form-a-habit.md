## The Challenge
Why form a habit at all? Maybe you want to master a new skill or sharpen your current skills. Perhaps, you believe that the practice will make you a better you. Habits are about your behavior, either by adding to your routine or removing from it.

Of course, we always aim to stick to the practice indefinitely. And therein lies the problem; we set our expectations way too high. Let me tell you. It's okay not to do it correctly every time. And it's okay not to do it each day.

Here are two everyday experiences. For some, it's a simple process. You decide you're going to do something, keep at it, and feel good about sticking to your new habit. For others, like myself, it's a real challenge to keep at it. It's easy to say you plan to do something; words are cheap. It's much harder to do it.

Why is it so hard? Because it's all about emotions and expectations. We hold high regard for our new habit. We know it's good for us, but we struggle to get out and do it. Maybe it's a fear of not doing well on it at first. Perhaps, it's that it's generally hard, and we prefer to browse Reddit, Facebook, or any other social network instead. We avoid our goal and do other feel-good tasks, because well, it's hard. Our brain knows it prefers things that aren't hard. Our minds are very shortsighted. At the end of the day, once we're through all the other 'fun' activities we did to avoid the habit, we still have our practice on our list. And what happens? We beat ourselves up for not having done it.

### Value Trying
Let's change it up. Let's lower our expectations. Let's remove them altogether. While we're at it, let's also shed our assumptions. Now, let's only do one thing, value trying. Try first, and worry about the rest later.

## The 4 Steps to Forming a Habit
1. Cue - Set a location, time, and note how you feel at the moment.
2. Routine - Actively focus and have a plan on how to focus
