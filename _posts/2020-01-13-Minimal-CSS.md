title: Minimal CSS

I agree with [Frank](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/redesign-this-design/) when he says that a good minimal start for css is the following:

<pre><code>
p {
    font-family:    Georgia, serif;
    line-height: 1.5;
    max-width: 33em;
}
</code></pre>

I've <s>borrowed</s> shamelessly stolen some of his CSS for here.
