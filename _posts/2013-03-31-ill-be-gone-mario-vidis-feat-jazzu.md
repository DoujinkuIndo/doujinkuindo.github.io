# I'll Be Gone — Mario & Vidis feat. Jazzu

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pka3c67_MF4 This song is so absent and empty emotionally, and yet so full in timbre; it shuffles and shudders under its own weight; the claps and reverbs trickle off into pattering in the background, and the synths swell and subside; the vocalist breathes heavily before ever singing. When she does, it's resigned and apathetic, a dance beat to get out a notion of riddance. And it's bittersweet, but it's mostly bitter; the music stays light, but there's an underlying darkness. The video draws out the instruments in seismometers tracing blood onto graph paper; as the music goes on, it begins to float off the page; nothing is permanent.
