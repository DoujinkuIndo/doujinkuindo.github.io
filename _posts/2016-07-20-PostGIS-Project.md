I created a guide, [PostGIS Mapping and Plotting](projects/PostGIS-Mapping-and-Plotting/), that covers the installation of GIS tools, importing Wake County's GIS data, and creating a sample data plot using R. I'll be releasing more projects as I explore the area around where I live; I'm curious about demographics, points of interests, businesses and their finances (there's a lot of vacant retail space), etc. Stay tuned!
