# Not In Love — Crystal Castles feat. Robert Smith

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32udqal_lyQ Something about this song hits me like a ton of bricks. In content, it's a break-up song, about the end of a relationship and the inability to reconcile the gap between people; in tone, it's an anthem, a heart-pounding electronica dance mix; in context, I used it heavily in my own life as a love song, ironic and bittersweet and decontextualized; the song, already all but bereft of emotional content, gained only more. And Robert Smith, emerging from semi-retirement to perform guest vocals on a weird Canadian electronica track, he lends context too; suddenly this track is tied irrevocably to the entire catalogs of The Cure, and all the emotional weight that carries. And the song pounds on and on, and he's not in love, he's fallen out, and there's no rhyme or reason to why; it's part of his life, he'll carry on, but he doesn't have to be happy about it.
