We had two speakers from Seldon and solo.io joining us at our December Cloud Native London meetup at esynergy. We also had virtual attendees joining us via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. Unfortunately we had a technical problem with the audio during the beginning of the stream, and it only kicked in partway through the first speaker’s talk.

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), and [Styra](https://www.styra.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Ed Shee from Seldon with a talk on Cloud Native Machine Learning Deployments (starting at [12:27](https://youtu.be/isDASvizA3U?t=747)). His takeaways discussed: 

* How to deploy models as microservices on Kubernetes
* How to build powerful inference pipelines
* Why ML monitoring is important and how to do it

Then we had Alessandro Vozza from solo.io wrapping up our evening with "Look ma, no sidecar!" (starting at [47:14](https://youtu.be/isDASvizA3U?t=2834)). He talked about:

* The advantage of the sidecarless model
* Securing your L4 and L7 layers with service Mesh
* Why developers should love service mesh

And of course, our usual group photo!
