## First Look at the Data

We jumped right into exploring data. With Project Benson we had to use the publicly available NYC MTA turnstile data. This was an exciting first glance at what data science looks like and what data sets might and do look like.

I love NYC and have ridden the trains many times over the past ten years. The [MTA subway map](http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subway_map.pdf) gives a good introduction as to how complex the data of a simple set of counters will be. The data is the counter read at each turnstile at each station at mostly 4 hour intervals. There are eleven features per data point. We can divide them into three main categories: location, time, count.

For our team we were interested in the Entries count. We were, fictitiously, being hired by the Manhattan School of Music to assess what are good lines and stations for dances and musicians to perform at. The dancers were interested in performing inside the trains and wanted to know which lines were the busiest and if more stations meant more traffic for a line. The musicians were looking to perform within stations and wanted to know the busiest station along with if a station had more lines going through it would it be busier.
