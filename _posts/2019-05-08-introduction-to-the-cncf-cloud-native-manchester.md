* The mission of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation is to foster and sustain open source projects around cloud native.

* In practice, this means doing things developers don't want to do, including holding the legal trademarks, marketing, certification etc.

* The best way to get started with open source is to share your experience and journey through writing and speaking.

I was honoured to be the inaugural speaker at the Cloud Native Manchester meetup.
