# Sleep — Slowdive

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ey4yAgLZlw There is no greater sorrow than shoegaze. This is a refined product, shaped and manipulated into the perfect tonal expression of being a shy british teenager, unlucky in love, living in a quiet suburb, possibly seaside; the industry of the 1980s is gone, things are pastel, but peeling. The music scene is where the pent-up — it's not frustration, no, and not apathy either — desolation of teen angst is funneled. These aren't kids without prospects, but they're twenty- and thirty-somethings, moving to London not to entertain, but to express. And _Sleep_ is unintelligible. Only snatches of words prove it to be about loss, death, memory, moving on.
