title: Once upon a time, 7 Years ago.
---


7 years ago today I started a 3 month contract within the NHS working on a Sharepoint 2007 deployment.  As I write this blog I am working on replacing it with something new.  

A lot has happened in the 7 years since I started here, I am married to a beautiful lady, we have two highly energetic little boys.

During my time in the NHS, working for Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Foundation Trust, I have had more then a few ups and downs.  I have worked with some amazingly motivational people, these whom I am honoured to call Friends, mentors and family, and some that are not so.

Together we have led projects, hammocked, drank a lot of beer, eaten a lot of food,  laughed and cried.

##Who am I now?
I have grown up, become a man, a husband and a father.  I now wear amazing bowties most of the week I>@<I  

Some people still think of me as *mildly* arrogant, but I am able to bottle it up when needed (sometimes).    

Having learnt an awful lot about Quality Improvement Systems, Lean, Agile, UX, VMPS I am, I believe, in a uniquely positioned location and time in my life.  IT and Tech still excites me and always will but what excites me more, generates that hunger and thirst deap within, is the People and Processes behind the organisation.  How they interact with the Software, Hardware and 'Solutions' that us IT Techs thrust upon them.  I think it is safe to say that the majority of nursing staff within the NHS hate technology, they hate how it has been pushed between them and the patient as a barrier that detracts from the job that they origionally signed up to do.

The same can be said for many occupations, Police, Social Care.  Even in day-to-day life our interaction with others has become less personal with technology moving services away from the highstreet  and into the cold clinical call centre.  Yes Technology has helped in a lot of ways to improve our lives and the lives of people around us.
