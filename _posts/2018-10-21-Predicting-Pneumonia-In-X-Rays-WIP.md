title: Predicting Pneumonia in X-ray Images
---


 
Translating data science into something that is actually useful and beneficial to society at large is something I am passionate about. Yes, you can target marketing advertisements with more precision and get people to buy things they don't need but that isn't something I want to do. I'm not sure exactly where I'm going to try to go with my career in data science but when I saw the [RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge) on Kaggle, it seriously caught my attention. I have been looking for an interesting way to apply my knowledge and skills with something more meaningful than predicting the prices of homes in Ames, Iowa. I am eager to see what I can do with this.

For this Kaggle competition, each team is supposed to take an X-ray image and do two things: 1) classify it as either containing Pneumonia or not containing Pneumonia, and 2) accurately produce bounding boxes around the areas containing Pneumonia, if there are any. This is a much more challenging problem than I've done thus far. I'm going to start a little smaller by just building a classifying model that will tell me if there is Pneumonia in the X-ray or not. To that end, I believe that using a Convolutional Neural Network would work well. Look forward to some more posts about this project!
