# A Short Ride in a Fast Machine

Salvaging. Putting together a schedule. As less things happen, less bad things happen, and less things to write about. Like in The Stand. Frannie skips days in her Journal. That's a good thing. There's no shame in consistency - as long as there's no chance of waking up in a year and realizing it was the wrong kind of consistency. Still, I did work today. Put together a SoundCloud. Put together plans for a live jam. For Improv Everywhere. For a sleepover. Gears are turning. Things are good.
