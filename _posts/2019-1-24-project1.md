Working on Project 1.

Idea is to have crypto currencies revolve around the moon with each play/click.

Trouble with uploading images because they were too big.

Solved by generating assets of said .psd files.

All crypto coins are uploading on p5.js web editor

Also made a space background and uploaded to p5.js web editor
