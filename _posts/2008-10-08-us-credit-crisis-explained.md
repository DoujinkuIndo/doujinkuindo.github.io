This is the [best explaination Iâ€™ve seen so far of the US credit crisis](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2008/10/collateralized-debt-obligations-cdos-are-investment-instruments-that-are-partially-to-blame-for-the-mortgage-crisis-what.html). It runs for approx 6min on youtube, you will want speakers. Clear and simple.

Bonus link: [Economics explained](http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=VVp8UGjECt4) (this one takes the mikey, the other link above is serious).
