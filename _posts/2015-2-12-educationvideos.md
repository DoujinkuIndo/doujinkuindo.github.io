title: Education via Youtube
description: "There many great educational channels and videos on YouTube."
---

YouTube is well know as the website that hosts the cat videos, and while the cat videos are 
abundant and adorable, there's been a new trend on YouTube toward channels and videos that
offer viewers education as well as entertainment. 

My introduction to educational videos started with the general "How To" theme. 
Whether it be building a website, fixing the settings on my computer, 
or how to do my own laundry. (Sorry Mom, but I totally learned that from the internet.)
After spending years on YouTube mostly watching comedy bits and the aforementioned cat videos, 
I was finally introduced to the [Vlogbrothers](http://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers) 
through their human sexuality [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXAoG8vAyzI). 
In my mind, the Vlogbrothers (John and Hank Green) revolutionized YouTube. Their channel 
started in 2007 with Brotherhood 2.0 as a experiment for the brothers and entertainment for their viewers. 
As time went on, their videos started including more educational materials about history and current events.
When it clear that viewship took a strong liking to these types of videos, the brothers 
decided to create channels with educational themes in mind.

At the time of writing this, the Vlogbrothers have produced:

* SciShow - a channel about all things science
* SciShow Space - a channel about all things astronomy
* Crash Course - a series of playlists for topics at the level of high school course, 
so far there are playlists for:
	* [US Government and Politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrk4oY7UxpQ&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H)

* Health Care Triage - a channel that focuses on providing health information where research is the main source
* How to Adult - a channel that teaches basic thing they don't teach in school about being an adult

I tend to watch mostly educational channels relating to STEM subjects. 
Other channels that I've enjoyed are: 
* Minute Physics
* Minute Earth
* AsapSCIENCE
* [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium)

Other great educational channels:
* Mental Floss
* Drunk History

There are hundreds of wonderful educational channels out there and I encourage you to go look for them,
or to start your own. 
(I produced one video on my channel so far! I hope to one day return and post more.)
