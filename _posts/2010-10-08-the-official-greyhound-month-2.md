After month 2:

Number of trips = 13  
Total time spent travelling = approx 69 hours  
Cost of travel without the pass = $666

$1424 worth of travel on a $530 pass across the 2 months&#8230; Pretty happy with that.  
And a total of 189 hours, or 7.875 days, spent on 26 bus trips over 2 months.

This post proves I have way too much time on my hands. Unemployment is great!
