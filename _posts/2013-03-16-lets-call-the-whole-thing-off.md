# Let's Call The Whole Thing Off — Ella Fitzgerald + Louis Armstrong

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2oEmPP5dTM Yesterday morning, before my Calc midterm, one of the guys who sits near me piped up: he'd been going through a breakup; he'd been studying for midterms; things were bad, and this song roused his spirits. He said: there's a part near the end (3:16) where Louis Armstrong just shouts 'tomahter' in the silliest way. So we're in this math classroom at 9am, with my stomach churning and my head pounding and a math midterm before me: and suddenly the entire class including the teacher is doing Louis Armstrong impressions, shouting _tomahter _at the top of our lungs.
