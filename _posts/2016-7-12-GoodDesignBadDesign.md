There are two design questions I love to answer.

**1. What is an app that you think exhibits good visual design, but has a poor user experience and why?**

**PlayStation 4 UI** *(not an app, I know)*

I play video games casually, but, also use my PS4 for many other functions: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Spotify, chatting with friends, and more. The PS4 provides tons of functionality but doesn't make it easy to access and use. For the sake of brevity, I'll give one crucial example.

**Navigation.** The primary form of navigation on the PS4 is a long, horizontally scrolling list. There is a system-level menu you can access by moving the directional pad up one level and related sub menus for most items can be found by moving down a level.

Pictured above, you can see this user has lots of games and apps and has to scroll horizontally to find what he's looking for. Navigating this interface becomes increasingly difficult the more you use it because the list only grows longer. There is no way to jump to the end/beginning of a list, no way to quickly search for an app, and no way to reorder the list (unless you uninstall and reinstall a bunch of apps in a certain order).

Pictured above is the system-level menu. It's conveniently located but there are no signifiers that tell the user they can move up one level to access this menu – quite confusing for new users.

Good navigation is **EXTREMELY** important to me – ask me about Spotify and I can talk all day.

**2. What is an app that you think exhibits a good user experience, but has poor visual design and why?**

I can't think of a more appropriate answer than **Craigslist**.

Just for science, I checked out Craigslist's previous site versions on the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org). Fundamentally it has always looked the same: categories for everything you could ever want to buy containing unordered lists that are comprised of blue hyperlinks. It's not pretty, but it doesn't need to be.

In this day and age of design we argue about the pros and cons of hamburger menus and how they obscure content and spend countless hours fine-tuning animations. Craigslist has more or less kept the same visual design since its inception in 1995. It's a model of good user experience: the site geo-locates you and automatically loads the most relevant Craigslist page, it's easy to find what you're looking for either via search bar or the navigation – the home page is the navigation, it's easy to find help and information about the company, and so much more.

Visual design will always be important. It invokes emotion. A beautiful site establishes credibility and trust, the appearance that it's easier to use, a positive first impression, and relaxes the user.

Craigslist is no-fluff. They want users to be able to buy and sell on the site quickly with no unneeded complexity. Steven Krug wrote a fantastic book on usability, *Don't Make Me Think*. An author at UX Booth extracted [10 Key Lessons from the book](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/10-usability-lessons-from-steve-krugs-dont-make-me-think/). Though they all apply to Craigslist, I found Lesson 1 particularly relevant:

<blockquote>Usability means making sure something works well, and that a person of average ability or experience can use it for its intended purpose without getting hopelessly frustrated.</blockquote>

By this very definition, Craigslist is a model of good user experience. The visual design.. eh.
