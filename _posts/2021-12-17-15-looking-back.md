Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #15**! This is gonna be a longer blog post, as I’m coming back from a month-long pause, and this will be the last blog post of 2021! Yes, it’s the end of 2021, and 8 months into a gap year has felt like no time at all. This blog post will feature a summary of what I’ve done in my 8 months into the gap year, as well as some cool charts and data insights because I love data.

Some bad news though - I will reduce my blog posts to a monthly schedule. I’ll continue to post in the middle of the month up until the end of the gap year, which is around April 2022. *Why?*

* I’m kicking off January 2022 with a TON of personal stuff to do from the get-go. That doesn’t include starting a job search. (Please no soliciting.)
* There are other personal stuff that I want to focus on, and I’m not comfortable sharing that information publicly on the Interwebs. Don’t worry though, everything is OK on my side.
* Maintaining the blog is low priority in comparison to what I have cooking for the rest of the gap year.
* It’s my blog and I do what I want.

### What I’ve been up to

I’ve spent two weeks in Atlanta visiting friends and family for the Thanksgiving holidays. It’s been a nice change of pace from my NYC routine. That being said, I was glad to be back in NYC in my own apartment, being able to grab a meal across the block, and hang out with Monty warming my lap. I also returned with some packages post-ordering during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

I’ll be hanging around NYC for the rest of the year. A pandemic still being a pandemic, I’ll be cooking a mini Christmas feast (beef stew, roasted vegetables, charcuterie, and more), decorating the apartment with festive lights, and video chatting with the family. Well, Monty didn't play nice with the festive lights, so I'll get a bit more creative with Christmas decorations this year.

### What I’ve learned

A tradition I love doing at the end of the year is to go back through my journal and reflect on all the things I’ve done over the year, so that I know what I want to do for the next year.

Most importantly - I’m so happy I did the gap year! It was a relief to be able to decompress from work amidst a pandemic. While I'm sure you see this trending through social media, I did indeed re-evaluate my values in both personal and professional lives, and what I wanted out of both. It also helped me take time to appreciate what I have in the moment.

As much as the gap year was relaxing, I am starting to feel the boredom creep in as the software engineering brain was slowly seeping out of my ears. However, given that I renewed my CKAD certification and went through a few coding exercises, I wasn’t too worried about getting back into the groove of tech. Perhaps, it will be a new "groove" post-gap year.

#### My List

Being the end of the year, I’m supposed to talk about what amazing things I’ve done this year, such as a new business with two side hustles while I lost 15 pounds with a new sleep and diet regimen to boost my productivity.

...or I could be a normal human being with a penchant for some data and organization. There are things that I’ve planned throughout this year, some of which I’ve completed, and some I dropped along the way. I’ve also picked up some things that I didn’t expect to do this year.

##### Things I’ve done and actually finished

* *Volunteered in a hospital.* I’ve also done other volunteering gigs over the past year or so, but this was the longest commitment.
* *Renewed my CKAD certification.* This took about 3 weeks to refresh and prepare.
* *Spent 8 months into a gap year without going bankrupt or insane.* Otherwise I wouldn’t be writing this.
* *Cooked a bunch of meals.* This included familiar and new meals. I've gotten a better intuitive sense of cooking as a result!
* *Traveled domestically.* I did this cautiously and being aware of my budget, but it was fun!
* *Took a bunch of online courses to keep myself mentally-stimulated.* More below.
* *Practice doing makeup beyond the bare minimum.* Hint: quality of tools helped a lot.
* *Visited various places in New York City.* There’s a lot of gold nuggets in the concrete jungle.
* *Relaxed and decompressed!*

##### Things I wanted to do but didn’t follow through

* *Run a 10k.* I actually got close earlier in the summer, but an abnormal series of heatwaves and downpours in NYC really threw a wrench in that plan. Instead, I compensated by walking whenever I could, and adjusting my diet accordingly.
* *Travel internationally.* That’s okay though. It was more wishful thinking than anything.
* *Improve my illustrating skills.* I did do a variety of creative outlets, but a greater variety than a greater depth.
* *Read a lot more books.* That was entirely replaced by my hardcore studying, but I did get in a few novels.
* *Go scuba diving.* Given that I would need to travel and rent equipment, I decided it’d be more sensible to drop this activity.

##### Things I didn’t expect to do but did it anyways

* *Adopt a cat!* I was thinking about it for a few years, but it wasn’t until recently that I had the opportunity to go through the hoops.
* *Do a lot of apartment renovations to accommodate a cat.* Mostly this involved putting away things that will get knocked down by a curious cat.
* *Go to a bar this year.* This was during a period of the pandemic where the COVID-19 cases were very low in NYC, and everyone was vaccinated.
* *Practice my Chinese in a setting other than restaurants.* Mostly through volunteer work.
* *Lots of takeout and delivery.* Yes, I had time to cook, but sometimes I just want to relax for the night. I rarely order delivery pre-pandemic.
* *Rode a bike in NYC.* It was only one time, but I guess that counted!
* *Play a game of Civilization for the first time in over 15 years.* It was 100% out of the blue. Fun fact - this inspired Monty’s name!

These lists don’t include money-making startups or life-changing publications, but I’d say it’s a darn good for a pandemic-riddled year.

#### Study Stats for Fun

One of the major things that I wanted to do during my gap year was to learn.

Since the start of the pandemic, I was inspired to learn more about the biological sciences. Me being me, I ended up going into a rabbit hole that involves diving into the physical sciences (even into electromagnetism) as well as health and behavioral sciences (which I had a taste of during my time in college, but was bottom of my priority list at the time).

So a question you might have is - *why didn’t I post anything about what I’ve learned in the biological sciences?* Because it drives too close to COVID-19 and the problems with misinformation around it. While my science foundation is improving everyday, I also learned that I know so little about the field. I didn’t feel that I could condense my knowledge into a blog post without leaving out a dissertation of a footnote, nor misspeak about a topic that scientists and health professionals are uncovering themselves.

But the sciences weren’t the only things I’ve learned. Earlier, I’ve taken a scuba diving course, but had to drop the idea early on. I also renewed both my CKAD certification and CPR certifications, which both expired this year. Plus, I've learned many different recipes to cook, new small shops around my area, and my cat's personality.

I originally recorded the amount of study time in a notebook so I could better pace my study time. It wasn’t until a few months ago that I entered the data into Google Sheets. I wanted to see if any cool patterns emerged.

<div align="center">

</div>

This chart came out really cool. This represents the daily study time, with a color breakdown by course. You could see the color change as courses started or were completed. You can also see some gaps where I didn’t study for the day because of vacations. However, it was hard to glean any other patterns. I wrestled with some Google Sheets aggregations.

<div align="center">

</div>

I aggregated the study time by week with no breakdown by course. It was neat to see how much time I dedicated to studying over the weeks. Now I wanted to see the course breakdown alongside the weekly study time. I reformatted the data and wrestled with some more Google Sheets aggregations.

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/blog15/blog15-study_weekly_better.png" width="500" />
</div>

Tada! A cleaner bar chart. I aggregated the courses by broader categories, so there were less colors in the chart to visualize.

One data point I didn’t add was my daily use of Anki, which has been super useful for spaced repetition learning. This allows me to retain the information I've learned better than rifling through my study notes. The app was meant for quick reviews under 30 minutes, so the study time wasn't included.

#### Counting Things

One of the most important parts of the gap year was keeping track of my finances. This is to ensure that I wouldn’t need to bail out of the gap year due to financial incompetency. I’m happy to say that I was pretty darn close to my budget! I was around $125 from my estimated budget of tens of thousands of dollars, which included both expected and unexpected expenses.

How did I plan my budget for the gap year? I categorized my spendings on 3 broad categories:
1) *Essentials.* These are the things I must spend or become a hobo. They’re also fairly fixed in price. They include rent, utilities, and insurance.
2) *Budgeted.* These are the things I’ve planned to spend in the gap year, or need to spend to replace stuff. I also included things that would be considered “essential”, like groceries, but spending can vary. They include groceries, apartment supplies, and cat supplies.
3) *Fun.* These are the things I can cut out if I’m tight on money. This is also a pulse reading on how much I'm spending to enjoy the gap year. They include vacations, restaurant food, and tickets.

I already kept track of my finances through Google Sheets, so I already had a sense of how much I was currently spending. I then grouped the line item categories into one of 3 buckets, then estimated the allowance from there. The categories helped me better estimate my spending by allocating an “allowance” on the broad categories, rather than on specific categories. i.e. Groceries are necessary, but the cost can vary via inflation or specific meal plans.

How did I do per category?

</div>

From this pie chart, the Essential category consisted of a little over 50% of total spending. (Hint: most of that spending was from rent.) Next was Budgeted, then Fun. What exactly did I spend to get these percentages?

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/blog15/blog15-counting_pie.png" width="500" />
</div>

1) Not surprisingly, **rent** was a huge contributor to my spending. I live in an NYC neighborhood that I really like, so the opportunity cost to move to a cheaper area hasn't been worth it yet.
2) The next biggest spend was in **education**, which was also not surprising. I found that spending a bit of money helps me retain the information, but yikes the price tag was high.
3) I was a little surprised by how much money I spent on **vacation**, which was the third-largest category. This didn't include some travel points that I redeemed to offset some of the travel costs.

All other categories were chump change in comparison to the three largest contributors. There were some line items I’ve made redundant, or perhaps should’ve broken down further.

Lastly, for fun, I wanted to see my monthly spending patterns over time.

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/blog15/blog15-counting_monthly.png" width="500" />
</div>

As expected, Essential spending was fairly constant, while Budgeted spending was the most variable. I did always give myself some spending on Fun, though I might’ve cheated and shifted those line items into the Budgeted category.

I'm spending a bit of time to think of how to make the apartment more festive without Monty knocking it over like a cat. This will probably involve paper streamers and smaller decor.</i></div>
