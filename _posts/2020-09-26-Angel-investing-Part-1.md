In this multi-part series 
Capture learnings so far 
from the world of angel investing
 
# Prologue

## Why these posts

When introduced to angel investing (a.k.a. seed stage investing) 
I honestly did not know what to expect
I had heard mentions like everyone else but that was it
In that particular instance someone smarter than me was advocating it, so I had to listen

## Who they are for

Tbh Primarily for me
I have found that my thoughts crystallize much better when I explain or I write them down
Not to mention explaining something in a digestible way forces you to understand it better yourself.  

By consequence they intended audience is someone like me
Clueless, or with some limited knowledge, but yet interested
in investing, businesses and the mechanics of value creation 

So to keep things simple let's say this is a long letter to myself, 5 - 7 years in the past. 

## What they are 

These posts are my understanding 
of the concepts and the internals 
through reading, discussions 
my own research and observations 
and interactions with company founders

However
I am not a professional investor 
Nor a VC partner
I am not a successful startup founder 
I cannot even claim to be an early startup employee

So all of these are effectively opinions and observations of an outsider.
If there are angel investor credentials, I do not have them. 

## What they are not / Disclaimer

By consequence of the above, nothing in these posts constitutes investment advice.
Let me repeat:
Not. Investment. Advice.

Private equity is unregulated
 opaque 
and completely illiquid
Let's also not forget 2 other facts:    
* the startups that succeed are almost a rounding error, and
* the world is brimming with scammers.

In other words there are much better parking spots for your money 

In addition, nothing in these posts constitutes endorsement or disapproval of anything or anyone.
I may offer some examples to make a point, but they are exactly that: examples. 
No fanboy, no dissing.

Finally, the opinions are only mine.
They do not represent those of any present or past employer.

## Credits / TL;DR

All credit goes to Nick Ogden and his very insightful presentation to SyndicateRoom
https://youtu.be/wcg0gKO_Vyk?t=2294

Really helped me convert my scattered thoughts into something which resembles a framework   
If you only have a few minutes to spare, you can just skip these posts watch the presentation 

# Intro

![A simple idea](../assets/images/angel-part1/med-badr-chemmaoui-ZSPBhokqDMc-unsplash.jpg)

A business is a very complicated system. A lot of different and opposing "forces" need to be kept at an optimal 
equilibrium.  
A successful business even more so.  
Contrary to the popular myth that it ["only takes a good idea"][1] to succeed, the reality is somewhat different.  
A new business has a number of things stacked up against it.   

Of course, we intuitively know that [some ventures thrive][2], some in a huge way. So much so that in the last 15 years 
there is a global startup culture (link)
The digitization of everything (link) has lowered the barrier to entry (link) for new businesses. But technology alone 
is not enough. <sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>  

Any new startup-in-the-making 
has a number of "lenses" to be viewed with  

In the whole lifecycle of the business (from fledgling idea to small to large venture) 
all of these aspects become equally important 
But at different stages and for different "stakeholders" <sup>[2](#footnote_2)</sup> 
some of them may have an outsized weight

These aspects are captured in 4 + 1 letters: PAID T
Or Get PAID Tons, if you want to remember it.  

# Letter P

![Letter P](../assets/images/angel-part1/lauren-fleischmann-seSgGa1SFDs-unsplash.jpg)

The letter P stands for the **What** of the business
In product management (link) lingo this is the user **Problem** that it solves
In other words, how would one describe the business in a couple of sentences?

This can be further broken down in 2 parts.

## Problem

This probably takes little clarification
The business *must* be solving a **real user problem** 

Let's start from the word 'problem'
The world around us is full of inefficiencies, sometimes to the point of injustice. 
from the most fundamental (e.g. access to education) to the most complex aspects of life (e.g. access to financial services)

A business idea with any hope of success will need to be identifying and attempting to address one or more of these needs 
(https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-need-statements)
This process is not as easy as it sounds 
It requires observation of the problem and thinking in order to arrive at an insight for the underlying need 
Frameworks like [JTBD][18] are useful as an indication of whether the business is addressing a symptom or a real problem <sup>[3](#footnote_3)</sup>

The second word is 'real'
Founders have personal affinity to the problem space
Have been personally impacted 
knows the pain that it is causing, lack of existing solutions and knows other people with that need
This is an initial bellwether of if the market would be interested in the business' offering

On the other hand it makes for a dubious start 
when the business is trying to solve problems that are not there 
i.e. being small everyday nuisances or having already been solved (and the founder does not know about) <sup>[4](#footnote_4)</sup>

Like with everything in life 
the answer to the above is not black and white
Technology is a great leveller (link) 
The founder may be ahead of her time and identified a future user need (link to RZ01)
or has identified a novel solution for a domain filled with sub-par alternatives (link to GC)  

## Type of business

Not all ventures are created equal 
Depending on *exactly what* they are doing
they come with their own specific challenges, economics and required skill-sets <sup>[5](#footnote_5)</sup>

Needless to say that  
* these categories do not cover everything under the sun, and 
* not every business out there will fall neatly in a single category.

**Produce**  

This is probably the simplest type of business 
a business generating some produce (or basic manufacturing product)
Think of a vegetable farm, a vineyard or manufacturing plastic straws
May look like very simplistic but it may be covering a genuine need or introducing a new variety in an underdeveloped 
market <sup>[6](#footnote_6)</sup>

A produce type of business requires 2 basic things:  
* Capital  
A farm or a factory are [capital intensive][7]; one needs to do a lot of preparation and investment up-front.
* Know-how  
As a corollary of the above, one needs to have a knowledge of the domain.  
You cannot just create an [MVP][8] of a vineyard if you don't know what you are doing. It would take [4 years][9] to 
realize you made a mistake.

**Peddle**  

Another simple type
Buy things low, sell them high 

Death of brick-and-mortar shops
and myriad online directories of producers/traders 
Barrier to entry has lowered significantly, especially in the developed world <sup>[7](#footnote_7)</sup>
Low initial capital 
Large competition as easy to replicate
glut of producers and products to buy from 
results in low margins  

Differentiating factors 
Otherwise it is hard to scale 
* **Attract attention** 
Marketing spend
Bidding on Amazon or Google search keywords
This is effectively an ["arms race"][12] and invariably leads to upfront spend and lower longer-term margins   
* **Big market**  
A huge market (preferably with [inelastic demand][15]) also helps
These recent months have provided an almost text-book example: [PPE][16]  
* **Niche market**
Sometimes there is a market which it is so niche the few sellers get the buyers' undivided attention 
as it is not well-covered
This could be anything: from [sneakers][13] to [Decentraland real-estate][14] 
* **Deep knowledge**  
The 2 above points could be combined in 
Trading business needs to have a deep knowledge 
https://www.inc.com/magazine/201603/burt-helm/pharmapacks-amazon-warehouse.html
Knowledge of trends
knowledge of markets 
to front-run 

**Process**  

Facilitate 
automate 
make more efficient an existing process or service
I will call these "service companies" <sup>[8](#footnote_8)</sup>  

This can be truly anything 

[Automating payment setup and collection][17], medical image data analysis, online stock purchases, air ticket 
reservation,...

These ventures have identified an aspect of everyday life or a business process
which is complex, convoluted, time-consuming  

Using technology as a leverage 
they facilitate, automate  
simplifying and streamlining 

Initial costs of setting up are lower 
compared to brick-and-mortar 

but still need to invest heavily in 2 things
* the cost of creating the service software, 
* (most importantly) marketing and sales, and
* (more often than not) [subsidising sales prices][19]

The reason that sales are so important 
is that, like with everything else, the barrier to entry for technology 
has lowered for everyone 
So after the initial insight of identifying the problem
anyone can attempt to replicate the solution through software 

Being a front-runner service company does not necessarily guarantee success by itself
having the first-mover advantage is good
At some-point a competitor service company will emerge 
with either more efficient use of technology 
or better customer pricing 
The only outcome of these is that undifferentiated service companies sooner or later have a 
[price race to the bottom][20] <sup>[8](#footnote_8)</sup> 
 
**Product**  

A product company is  


**Platform**  


**Patent / Royalties**

A for Accounting a.k.a the "How Much"

## Assumptions & Hopes 

(a.k.a. Business plan)

TAM

Model (subscription vs per transaction)

### CAC & LTV

### Revenue & Projections


## Follow-up rounds 

## Runway




## Footnotes

1. <a name="footnote_1"></a>Otherwise all software developers would be successful business people.
2. <a name="footnote_2"></a>In the startup world the "stakeholders" are: [Founders and Enterpreneurs][3], 
[Accelerators and Incubators][4], [Investors and VCs][5] 
3. <a name="footnote_3"></a>One quick, naive, example.  
Here are 2 invented problem statements / observations, for the same user in a developing country.  
"The user cannot access education content on her smartphone to get a degree"  
"The user cannot access education opportunities to improve her livelihood"  
The second one contains a key insight as to the "why" the user cares about tele-education in the first place. There are 
many ways of improving one's livelihood, starting with education.   
4. <a name="footnote_4"></a>It is hard to know, e.g., the real needs, pains and solutions for new parents, without 
somehow partaking in the "sport" yourself.  
5. <a name="footnote_5"></a>And, funny enough, most of the business type names also start with P.  
Hencewhy included in this section. 
6. <a name="footnote_6"></a>Two examples, off the top my head:  
* Until recently the luxury hospitality sector in East Africa was looking for local certified organic produce; there was 
not a single local farm producing it.
* Anecdotally, the Nigerian market has an insatiable craving for balloons for festive occasions. Yet, again, until recently
there were few to none local producers, despite the fact that [rubber grows natively][6]. Huge amounts are imported, 
subject to large duties.
7. <a name="footnote_7"></a>In the not-so-distant past, in order to trade, one needed to have  
* a physical store to display and store the goods (i.e. upfront capital spend and unelastic, recurring expenses) and 
* personal relationships with suppliers (where do you go to buy X?).  
With everything found online and the ability to [outsource inventory management][11] these requirements have vanished.
8. <a name="footnote_8"></a>Not to be confused with the alternative meaning of the term: [body-shopping and consulting][23]. 
9. <a name="footnote_9"></a>A great example of this race is payments in the UK.  
[OpenBanking][21] has been a huge leveller, lowering the barrier-to-entry in the payments service space. This has lead to an 
explosion of service companies and a rapid price competition, to the point of [almost being uneconomical][22].
