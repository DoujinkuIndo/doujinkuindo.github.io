In this multi-part series 
Capture learnings so far 
from the world of angel investing
 
# Prologue

## Why these posts

When introduced to angel investing (a.k.a. seed stage investing) 
I honestly did not know what to expect
I had heard mentions like everyone else but that was it
In that particular instance someone smarter than me was advocating it, so I had to listen

## Who they are for

Tbh Primarily for me
I have found that my thoughts crystallize much better when I explain or I write them down
Not to mention explaining something in a digestible way forces you to understand it better yourself.  

By consequence they intended audience is someone like me
Clueless, or with some limited knowledge, but yet interested
in investing, businesses and the mechanics of value creation 

So to keep things simple let's say this is a long letter to myself, 5 - 7 years in the past. 

## What they are 

These posts are my understanding 
of the concepts and the internals 
through reading, discussions 
my own research and observations 
and interactions with company founders

However
I am not a professional investor 
Nor a VC partner
I am not a successful startup founder 
I cannot even claim to be an early startup employee

So all of these are effectively opinions and observations of an outsider.
If there are angel investor credentials, I do not have them. 

## What they are not / Disclaimer

By consequence of the above, nothing in these posts constitutes investment advice.
Let me repeat:
Not. Investment. Advice.

Private equity is unregulated
 opaque 
and completely illiquid
Let's also not forget 2 other facts:    
* the startups that succeed are almost a rounding error, and
* the world is brimming with scammers.

In other words there are much better parking spots for your money 

In addition, nothing in these posts constitutes endorsement or disapproval of anything or anyone.
I may offer some examples to make a point, but they are exactly that: examples. 
No fanboy, no dissing.

Finally, the opinions are only mine.
They do not represent those of any present or past employer.

## Credits / TL;DR

All credit goes to Nick Ogden and his very insightful presentation to SyndicateRoom
https://youtu.be/wcg0gKO_Vyk?t=2294

Really helped me convert my scattered thoughts into something which resembles a framework   
If you only have a few minutes to spare, you can just skip these posts watch the presentation
