In this multi-part series 
Capture learnings so far 
from the world of angel investing
 
# Prologue

## Why these posts

When introduced to angel investing (a.k.a. seed stage investing) 
I honestly did not know what to expect
I had heard mentions like everyone else but that was it
In that particular instance someone smarter than me was advocating it, so I had to listen

## Who they are for

Tbh Primarily for me
I have found that my thoughts crystallize much better when I explain or I write them down
Not to mention explaining something in a digestible way forces you to understand it better yourself.  

By consequence they intended audience is someone like me
Clueless, or with some limited knowledge, but yet interested
in investing, businesses and the mechanics of value creation 

So to keep things simple let's say this is a long letter to myself, 5 - 7 years in the past. 

## What they are 

These posts are my understanding 
of the concepts and the internals 
through reading, discussions 
my own research and observations 
and interactions with company founders

However
I am not a professional investor 
Nor a VC partner
I am not a successful startup founder 
I cannot even claim to be an early startup employee

So all of these are effectively opinions and observations of an outsider.
If there are angel investor credentials, I do not have them. 

## What they are not / Disclaimer

By consequence of the above, nothing in these posts constitutes investment advice.
Let me repeat:
Not. Investment. Advice.

Private equity is unregulated, opaque and completely [illiquid][36].  
Let's also not forget 2 other facts:    
* the startups that succeed are almost a [rounding error][37], and
* the world is brimming with scammers.

In other words, there are much better parking spots for your money.

Also, nothing in these posts constitutes endorsement or disapproval of anything or anyone.  
I may offer some examples to make a point, but they are exactly that: examples. No fanboy, no dissing.

Finally, the opinions are only mine. They do not represent those of any present or past employer.

## Credits / TL;DR

All credit goes to [Nick Ogden][35] and his very insightful [presentation to SyndicateRoom][34].  
Really helped me convert my scattered thoughts into something which resembles a framework. 
 
If you only have a few minutes to spare, you can just skip these posts and watch his presentation instead. 

# Intro

![A simple idea](../assets/images/angel-part1/med-badr-chemmaoui-ZSPBhokqDMc-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by Med Badr  Chemmaoui on Unsplash

A business is a very complicated system. A lot of different and opposing "forces" need to be kept at an optimal 
equilibrium.  
A successful business even more so.  
Contrary to the popular myth that it ["only takes a good idea"][1] to succeed, the reality is somewhat different.  
A new business has a lot of things stacked up against it.   

Of course, we intuitively know that [some ventures thrive][2], some in a huge way. So much so that in the last 15 years 
there is a global startup culture (link)
The digitization of everything (link) has lowered the barrier to entry (link) for new businesses. But technology alone 
is not enough. <sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>  

Any new startup-in-the-making 
has a number of "lenses" to be viewed with
in order to gage the probability of success  

In the whole lifecycle of the business (from fledgling idea to small to large venture) 
all of these aspects become equally important 
But at different stages and for different "stakeholders" <sup>[2](#footnote_2)</sup> 
some of them may have an outsized weight

These aspects are captured in 4 + 1 letters: PAID T
Or Get PAID Tons, if you want to remember it.  

# Letter P

![Letter P](../assets/images/angel-part1/lauren-fleischmann-seSgGa1SFDs-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by Lauren Fleischmann on Unsplash

The letter P stands for the **What** of the business
In product management (link) lingo this is the user **Problem** that it solves
In other words, how would one describe the business in a couple of sentences?

In very early ventures 
the idea is one of the most important bits 
to be accepted to an [accelerator][45]

This can be further broken down in 2 parts.

## Problem

This probably takes little clarification
The business *must* be solving a **real user problem** 

Let's start from the word 'problem'
The world around us is full of inefficiencies, sometimes to the point of injustice. 
from the most fundamental (e.g. access to education) to the most complex aspects of life (e.g. access to financial services)

A business idea with any hope of success will need to be identifying and attempting to address one or more of these needs 
(https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-need-statements)
This process is not as easy as it sounds 
It requires observation of the problem and thinking in order to arrive at an insight for the underlying need 
Frameworks like [JTBD][18] are useful as an indication of whether the business is addressing a symptom or a real problem <sup>[3](#footnote_3)</sup>

The second word is 'real'
Founders have personal affinity to the problem space
Have been personally impacted 
knows the pain that it is causing, lack of existing solutions and knows other people with that need
This is an initial bellwether of if the market would be interested in the business' offering

On the other hand it makes for a dubious start 
when the business is trying to solve problems that are not there 
i.e. being small everyday nuisances or having already been solved (and the founder does not know about) <sup>[4](#footnote_4)</sup>

Like with everything in life 
the answer to the above is not black and white
Technology is a great leveller (link) 
The founder may be ahead of her time and identified a future user need (link to RZ01)
or has identified a novel solution for a domain filled with sub-par alternatives (link to GC)  

## Type of business

Not all ventures are created equal 
Depending on *exactly what* they are doing
they come with their own specific challenges, economics, potential returns and required skill-sets <sup>[5](#footnote_5)</sup>

Needless to say that  
* these categories are my own classification, 
* they do not cover everything under the sun, and 
* not every business out there will fall neatly in a single category.

**Produce**  

This is probably the simplest type of business 
a business generating some produce (or basic manufacturing product)
Think of a vegetable farm, a vineyard or manufacturing plastic straws
May look like very simplistic but it may be covering a genuine need or introducing a new variety in an underdeveloped 
market <sup>[6](#footnote_6)</sup>

A produce type of business requires 2 basic things:  
* Capital  
A farm or a factory are [capital intensive][7]; one needs to do a lot of preparation and investment up-front.
* Know-how  
As a corollary of the above, one needs to have a knowledge of the domain.  
You cannot just create an [MVP][8] of a vineyard if you don't know what you are doing. It would take [4 years][9] to 
realize you made a mistake.

**Peddle**  

Another simple type
Buy things low, sell them high 

Death of brick-and-mortar shops
and myriad online directories of producers/traders 
Barrier to entry has lowered significantly, especially in the developed world <sup>[7](#footnote_7)</sup>
Low initial capital 
Large competition as easy to replicate
glut of producers and products to buy from 
results in low margins  

Differentiating factors 
Otherwise it is hard to scale 
* **Attract attention** 
Marketing spend
Bidding on Amazon or Google search keywords
This is effectively an ["arms race"][12] and invariably leads to upfront spend and lower longer-term margins   
* **Big market**  
A huge market (preferably with [inelastic demand][15]) also helps
These recent months have provided an almost text-book example: [PPE][16]  
* **Niche market**
Sometimes there is a market which it is so niche the few sellers get the buyers' undivided attention 
as it is not well-covered
This could be anything: from [sneakers][13] to [Decentraland real-estate][14] 
* **Deep knowledge**  
The 2 above points could be combined in 
Trading business needs to have a deep knowledge 
https://www.inc.com/magazine/201603/burt-helm/pharmapacks-amazon-warehouse.html
Knowledge of trends
knowledge of markets 
to front-run 
* **Exclusivity**  
This applies mainly to resale of products or software 
regional representative 
where exclusivity keeps out the competition and creates a single supply source 

**Process**  

Facilitate 
automate 
make more efficient an existing process or service
I will call these "service companies" <sup>[8](#footnote_8)</sup>  

This can be truly anything 

[Automating payment setup and collection][17], medical image data analysis, online stock purchases, air ticket 
reservation,...

These ventures have identified an aspect of everyday life or a business process
which is complex, convoluted, time-consuming  

Using technology as a leverage 
they facilitate, automate  
simplifying and streamlining 

Initial costs of setting up are lower 
compared to brick-and-mortar 

but still need to invest heavily in 2 things
* the cost of creating the service software, 
* (most importantly) marketing and sales, and
* (more often than not) [subsidising sales prices][19]

The reason that sales are so important 
is that, like with everything else, the barrier to entry for technology 
has lowered for everyone 
So after the initial insight of identifying the problem
anyone can attempt to replicate the solution through software 

Being a front-runner service company does not necessarily guarantee success by itself
having the first-mover advantage is good
At some-point a competitor service company will emerge 
with either more efficient use of technology 
or better customer pricing 
The only outcome of these is that undifferentiated service companies sooner or later have a 
[price race to the bottom][20] <sup>[9](#footnote_9)</sup> 
 
**Product**  

A product business is producing and offering something much 
more complicated than the physical products defined in the *Produce* section

Let's start with the [textbook definition][24]  
> a product is an object or system made available for consumer use; it is anything that can be offered to a market to 
> satisfy the desire or need of a customer... A service is also regarded to as a type of product.

In this case a product is the clever combination, layering and packaging of simpler tools and services
so that the whole is more valuable than the sum of the parts 
This could be a physical item (e.g. iPhone, Google Glass) or an online offering (e.g. [Medium][25])

It is worth unpacking the above terms for a second 
* Combination  
Engineering effort, glueing together and filling in the cracks
* Layering  
the different components of the product cannot just be thrown together
there has to be a logic and a sequence in the way they are presented to / interact with the user 
* Packaging  
Sleak design, seamless user experience

It should be clear that the above are much easier said than done
however this is where the value of a product company lies

The added value of the above combination offers a range of advantages
* Branding : differentiation from the competition
* customer stickiness: possibly other than price, there is little incentive to change for another product <sup>[10](#footnote_10)</sup>
* monetization: a good product is something that the customer is willing to pay for. It is also a solid base for the 
company to continue layering monetizable services and offerings on top

**Platform**  

In the business model peking order 
platform businesses is at the top step 

Let's see another [textbook definition][26]  
> A platform is a business model that creates value by facilitating exchanges between two or more interdependent groups, 
> usually consumers and producers.

Some of the biggest companies in the worlds are platforms 
* Amazon Marketplace and Alibaba: matching merchants and buyers
* Airbnb: matching home-owners with vacationers
* Uber: matching car owners with riders
and the list goes on

At the heart of a platform's success 
is the ability to create and maintain a [network effect][27]
i.e. the more participants on the platform, the better the quality of the product/service offering

It is easy to think that a platform is just a beautiful website
It is way, way more than that 

It needs to get **a lot** of things right
* Acquisition  
A platform is only successful if it can acquire both supply (e.g. merchants) and demand (e.g. buyers) in large and 
balanced numbers. Imbalances in the acquisition process result at best in [economic distortions][28] and at worst in 
participants just not bothering. 
* Process & Product 
A platform combines characteristics of both a Process/Service and a Product. 
Times 2-3 (for all different participants). 
And on steroids (in order to maintain and enhance the network effect)
So all the considerations of the previous sections apply here, multiple times 
in order to build trust
* Branding and marketing  
Attacting large numbers of people is not easy 
Marketing is a constant fight for attention
Ideal situation if the brand becomes synonymous with the marketplace <sup>[11](#footnote_11)</sup>
* Customer support  
People interacting with anything are a liability
Even more so with other people
No amount of technology can be a substitute for top-notch support from the get-go 
* Economics  
A platform is essentially its own micro-economy 
Just like any economy it needs constant monitoring and curation to avoid imbalances of pricing and supply/demand

Technology platform 


Getting all of the above right is pretty damn hard 
So the term ["unicorn"][29] is quite befitting for their rarity 

**Patent / Royalties**

A business built around one or more inventions 
The inventions can be truly anything: from biochemistry and material engineering to an innovative disaster shelter

The business then licenses out the manufacturing and/or commercialisation of the "thing"
to other entities 
and receives part of the proceeds 
either as a percentage of sales or as fixed royalties 

Best example is [Arm][30]

The key thing to note here is that 
these businesses depend almost entirely on legal structures for their survival 
Once an innovative "thing" is in the public domain 
the only thing that stops competitors from illicitly replicating it is the enforcement of [IP law][31]
This can be a problem, especially with countries offering [weak protections][32] 

Also worth noting that [franchise business development][33] 
is a huge part of this category    
franchises are almost always consumer-facing, usually offering an at-first-sight simple service (e.g. McDonalds and 
American-style fast-food, DPD and [last-mile logistics][38],...)
Behind the scenes they are usually complex businesses, due to complex processes, complex supply chains or both 
marketing and branding is key
to ensure customer loyalty and differentiate between different offerings  

# Letter A 

![Letter A](../assets/images/angel-part1/rich-smith-L8lqR8i_Uug-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by Rich Smith on Unsplash

Having covered the "What" of the business
moving on to letter 
A for Accounting a.k.a the "How Much"

This is where we can get an idea about the profitability (or even plain viability) of the business

## Assumptions & Hopes 

A also stands for assumptions & hopes a.k.a. the Business plan

Let's see the [textbook definition][39] 
> A business plan is a formal written document containing business goals, the methods on how these goals can be attained, 
> and the time frame within which these goals need to be achieved.

The first thought that comes to mind is that of a long, [formal document][41] 
A lot of time [spent typing rather than doing][40] 
This tends to put a lot of people off

They key thing to note here is that the business plan document is not the goal
The thinking and research that goes into the document is the goal
The document itself is just the prompt to trigger this process.

If the founder(s) have built the exact same business before and have deep domain knowledge
then a business plan is a wasted effort; they have all the answers in their heads.
For everyone else it is a necessary exercise

Some key aspects of the business plan creation

### TAM & TM
The [total addressable market][42] describes the size of the opportunity 
Startups are all about growth  
knowing that the total market value has many zeros behind it, gets everyone very excited 
Who doesn't want to ride the next rocket to the moon?

What is probably more important though is to realistically define the initial [target market][43] 
Which cohort of customers would buy from this business in its first few years? 
Who are they? What are their characteristics and preferences? 
How many are they? Where can they be found, how can the business reach them?  

Depending on the nature of the business, the answers to these questions may be crystal clear
Or not <sup>[12](#footnote_12)</sup>

The important bit here is to have a clear distinction between  
* the size of the TAM (when the business has reached world domination), and
* the possibly more humble initial TM (when the business will be struggling to make end meet)    

Clearly identifying and defining the TM will keep the business' efforts focused 
Once that segment of the market is captured, 
the business can apply the ["tip of the spear strategy"][44] and expand to other TAM segments

### Competition

Another important bit of this exercise is identifying the competition
The previous step identified the size of the pie
this one how many are eating from it

It might be tempting to just skip 
but [identifying competitors][46] can lead to some useful qualitative conclusions 
both for the founder and investors 
* Validation of the opportunity  
Having other businesses in the same space is a confirmation that there are customers willing to pay for the product
or service. 
* Competitive opportunity  
The identified competitors' short-comings and mistakes are opportunities to take advantage of (and mistakes to avoid).
* Customer awareness  
A corollary of the above is that customers are already aware of the product type
It is a very different effort to market [something invented than something innovative][47] (hint: inventions take much 
more customer education).
* Pricing reference  
Determining what is fair value from a customer's point-of-view may turn out to be a long, hit-and-miss process. 
Having one or more reference price points greatly accelerates the [price discovery][48] for the new product/service. 

With regards to the actual quantitative outcome of this exercise, there are 3 possible outcomes  
* No competitors  
Being early 
either something that noone wants or the beginning of a new big thing  
In this case it takes conviction (on the part of the founders) and persuasion (for both customers and investors) 
to believe that it is something useful
* Some competitors  
This is a validation that there is a market 
In this case winning is a matter of execution 
* Too many competitors  
Qualifying the word "many" is a bit subjective 
in general if it's a crowded and small market it might not be a good sign 
especially if this new business does not have a true differentiating factor 
it is a different discussion if the market is huge, in which case there is space for everyone

Identifying competition is not meant to dissuade 
Having competitors in a field is actually a good thing
helps keep the business' efforts grounded and focused 

### Pricing  

a.k.a. How to charge for things and (hopefully) make money

The first aspect is "how much"
This can be answered more easily if there are already players in the market
Looking at their prices, can provide some data points to use as a basis and guide
Then based on that decide the price strategy 
undercut competition
or go on par and above (superior service / luxury product)

There are 2 basic revenue models: [per purchase and subscription][49] 

The first one is straight-forward
make a sale and get paid 
the full price (if a producer/provider) or a percentage (if a middleman)

The subscription model is getting 
more and more attention 
with all kinds of unlikely businesses applying this (think subscription razors)

The main reason for this shift 
is the predictable [revenue stream][50] and (to an extent) the [counter-cyclicality][51] of subscriptions <sup>[13](#footnote_13)</sup>

Constructing [pricing models][52] for subscription businesses has become [almost a science][53].  
Almost invariably every business offers an initial [freemium][54] tier (to get feet "through the door") and then follows 
a ["Johnnie Walker"][55] pricing structure <sup>[14](#footnote_14)</sup>

### CAC & LTV



### Hiring and costs


### Revenue & Projections

In my humble opinion the most important deliverable of this process is the cash-flow spreadsheet
whereas one can be creative with words  

Period of hyper-volatility

## Footnotes

1. <a name="footnote_1"></a>Otherwise all software developers would be successful business people.
2. <a name="footnote_2"></a>In the startup world the "stakeholders" are: [Founders and Enterpreneurs][3], 
[Accelerators and Incubators][4], [Investors and VCs][5] 
3. <a name="footnote_3"></a>One quick, naive, example.  
Here are 2 invented problem statements / observations, for the same user in a developing country.  
"The user cannot access education content on her smartphone to get a degree"  
"The user cannot access education opportunities to improve her livelihood"  
The second one contains a key insight as to the "why" the user cares about tele-education in the first place. There are 
many ways of improving one's livelihood, starting with education.   
4. <a name="footnote_4"></a>It is hard to know, e.g., the real needs, pains and solutions for new parents, without 
somehow partaking in the "sport" yourself.  
5. <a name="footnote_5"></a>And, funny enough, most of the business type names also start with P.  
Hencewhy included in this section. 
6. <a name="footnote_6"></a>Two examples, off the top my head:  
* Until recently the luxury hospitality sector in East Africa was looking for local certified organic produce; there was 
not a single local farm producing it.
* Anecdotally, the Nigerian market has an insatiable craving for balloons for festive occasions. Yet, again, until recently
there were few to none local producers, despite the fact that [rubber grows natively][6]. Huge amounts are imported, 
subject to large duties.
7. <a name="footnote_7"></a>In the not-so-distant past, in order to trade, one needed to have  
* a physical store to display and store the goods (i.e. upfront capital spend and unelastic, recurring expenses) and 
* personal relationships with suppliers (where do you go to buy X?).  
With everything found online and the ability to [outsource inventory management][11] these requirements have vanished.
8. <a name="footnote_8"></a>Not to be confused with the alternative meaning of the term: [body-shopping and consulting][23]. 
9. <a name="footnote_9"></a>A great example of this race is payments in the UK.  
[OpenBanking][21] has been a huge leveller, lowering the barrier-to-entry in the payments service space. This has lead to an 
explosion of service companies and a rapid price competition, to the point of [almost being uneconomical][22]. 
10. <a name="footnote_10"></a>As the driver of any German car can happily attest.
11. <a name="footnote_11"></a>Think how so many businesses now describe themselves as "The Airbnb of...". Or the fact 
that any form of ride-sharing is an "uber". What does this tell about the dominance of these platform brands?
12. <a name="footnote_12"></a>Another simplistic example.  
The TAM of coffee drinkers around the world is just enormous. But the servicable and target markets are completely 
different when considering a neighborhood coffee shop and a coffee-at-home subscription service.
13. <a name="footnote_13"></a>In plain words, as a consumer you are more likely to "forget" that you have a subscription 
for something, than if you pay for it each time. This helps smooth out the ups and downs of your personal financial 
situation. It also makes you a more reliable "asset" in the subscription business' books.
14. <a name="footnote_14"></a>Where the bottom tier has just-about-enough features for a lower price (red label) and the 
top tier(s) a full feature set (with diminishing customer value) for a much higher price (blue label). This guides the 
subscriber to the middle option(s), which look like the best value-for-money (black label).
