For the extended family and friends, here is one of the photos from last months hike up the South East Ridge at Mount Barney.

This link shows a photo that one of the kids took while we [while we were breaking camp Sunday morning](http://hamilton.id.au/images/mountbarney/MountBarney%20352%20Breaking%20camp%20Sunday%20morning.JPG). Essentially it was a small ledge approx 1.5m one end and 2m the other end. We fit 5 kids (ages 10-15) and three adults on this ledge.

All in all a fantastic weekend ;-)
