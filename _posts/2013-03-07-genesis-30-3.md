# Genesis 30:3 — The Mountain Goats

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hajocz5c59w When a song is written with a background; when it samples a context, it gains and loses meaning. Casual listeners will find it less open, but it can also be more rewarding with a bit of effort. Done tastefully, it shouldn't matter. So: John Darnielle wrote an [album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_the_World_to_Come_\(album\)) of biblically-influenced songs. Genesis 30:3 is based off the stories of Jacob, Rachel, and Bilhah; it is at once immediately accessible through its basis as well as emotionally uncertain — almost cryptic. The song, as the verse, is gorgeous and sublime and graceful, if you will. I'm not sure how much analysis I can perform without burying Caesar, rather than praising him. I want you to read the [verse](http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-30-3/) for yourself and perform your own interpretation. There's not much left to be said about the Old Testament, I think.
