title: Anaconda Updates
---

Because I always end up searching for this every couple of months:

```conda update -n root conda```

```conda update python```

```conda update --all```

Really no reason I should forget these, but I rarely play with different environments in conda so I lose it pretty quickly. At least I can come back here when I can't figure out why some library isn't updating...
