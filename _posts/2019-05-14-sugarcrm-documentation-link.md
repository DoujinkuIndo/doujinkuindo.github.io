A link I'm finding I use a lot is this one: [SugarCRM version 9.0 Enterprise Documentation](https://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/?docVersion=9.0&docEdition=Ent).<!--more-->

From there you can access User/Admin/Developer guides and Release Notes. In other words, the right starting point for finding a lot of answers about how do things in SugarCRM.
