I really can&#8217;t be bothered typing everything out hey. So summary:

-work all day Friday  
-go to airport. Flight leaves without hitch  
-get to Dubai. Airport is nothing out of the ordinary.  
-plane leaves gate on time&#8230; only to turn back to the gate with some problem. Sit in the plane for 2 hours waiting for it to be fixed. Plane is airworthy, so we fly on to London YAYYYY  
-slight runny nose turns into a non-stop leak. 7 hours of this, awesome fun!  
-get to London, make way to hostel as fast as possible (the exxy London Heathrow Express train) only to find they can&#8217;t check me in just yet because they&#8217;re changing over shifts&#8230;  
-currently waiting to check in so I can get changed and head to the festival&#8230; already missed one band I want to see. At least there&#8217;s tomorrow.

Seeing ol&#8217; mate Tim and maybe Linda tonight. SWEEEEEET
