#### Welcome to Beautiful Kigali

To be very honest, it was a brilliant stroke of fortune that gave me the chance to attend this year's ICLR. 
For years, even prior to the pandemic, I had heardd all kinds of visa horror stories from would-be participants of some of the world's top conferences.

Enter COVID-19: the playing field for events was leveled, and we were all reduced to faces and names on Zoom screens, even for the world's most exclusive events.

I don't know if that's what made it click, or if it was the fresh community push towards equity or equality that ultimately caused the change,
but whatever it as, I am grateful, because for the first time, ever, the ICLR happened on African soil here in Kigali, where I just happened to have moved to complete grad school, and settled into work. ðŸ˜…

Talk about auspicious!

I know I'm not the only one who appreciated the opportunity. As you'll see in the image below, African registration was up to 261 from 16 at the last in-person ICLR event.
That's a whopping **1,631% increase**!
