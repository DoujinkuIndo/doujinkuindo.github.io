title: What Digital Calendar Do I Use?
---
It is a lot more practical for a person as immersed in the digital realm as I am to rely on a digital calendar instead of an analog one, which is precisely why I use one! 

My calendar of choice is Apple's [iCloud Calendar](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph2672?locale=en_GB), iPhone's native calendar application. This nativity is precisely why I use it â€“ as most anyone nowadays, I always have my phone on my person. If I ever did find myself in a situation where I didn't have my smartphone, I could [access the calendar online](https://www.icloud.com/#calendar) (log-in required) through any standard web browser.

As always, countless alternatives are available, the most popular being [Outlook Calendar](https://outlook.live.com/) and [Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/2465776?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
