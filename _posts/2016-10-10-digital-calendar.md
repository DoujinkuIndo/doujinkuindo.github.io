title: What Digital Calendar Do I Use?
---
It is a lot more practical for a person as immersed in the digital realm as I am to rely on a digital calendar instead of an analog one, which is precisely why I use one! 

My calendar of choice is Apple's [iCloud Calendar](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph2672?locale=en_GB), iPhone's native calendar application. This nativity is precisely why I use it â€“ as most anyone nowadays, I always have my phone on my person. If I ever did find myself in a situation where I didn't have my smartphone, I could [access the calendar online](https://www.icloud.com/#calendar) (log-in required) through any standard web browser.

When setting up a new event in iCloud Calendar, users can specify its name, location, duration and whether it is a regular event and is to appear repeatedly. Events can be placed into seperate calendars as well, effectively categorizing them by nature (personal or work events). Reminders for individual events can also be set up.

The app integrates into other applications as well, underlining times, days and dates, allowing the user to add them to the calendar. It even pulls events and birthdays from Facebook!

As always, countless alternatives are available, the most popular being [Outlook Calendar](https://outlook.live.com/) and [Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/2465776?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en). The features they offer are similar to the calendar I use and the differences between them are minuscule. In the end, it all comes down to personal preference.
