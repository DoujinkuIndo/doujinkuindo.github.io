title: What Digital Calendar Do I Use?
---
It is a lot more practical for a person as immersed in the digital realm as I am to use a digital calendar instead of an analog one, which is precisely why I use one! 

My calendar of choice is the [iCloud Calendar](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph2672?locale=en_GB), iPhone's native calendar application. This nativity is precisely why I use it - as most anyone nowadays, I always have my phone on my person. If I ever did find myself in a situation where I didn't have my smartphone, I could access the calendar online through any standard web browser.

As always, there are alternatives.
