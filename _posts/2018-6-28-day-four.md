Finally, today I was able to start photometry pretty much right off the bat -- I only had a little Github maintenence.

Yesterday, I was unable to get the code in the third part of Exercise 2 to work. I learned today that this was because the result from the second part of Exercise Two was incorrect. While I didn't get an error message, I was supposed to get a table with data about all the 5sigma stars in the original image. After looking up some syntax, I got the following result:

Then, after a a few changes, I got the third part of the code in Exercise Two to work and got this picture:
