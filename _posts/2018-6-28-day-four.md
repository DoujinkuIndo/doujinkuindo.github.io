Finally, today I was able to start photometry pretty much right off the bat -- I only had a little Github maintenence. I was able to finish all the photometry exercises today, though I still need to go back and adjust the code to make it run more nicely. After that, I should start being able to do some preliminary photometry on some real data.

## Exercise Two (cont.)
Yesterday, I was unable to get the code in the third part of Exercise 2 to work. I learned today that this was because the result from the second part of Exercise Two was incorrect. While I didn't get an error message, I was supposed to get a table with data about all the 5sigma stars in the original image. After looking up some syntax, I got the following result:

Then, after a a few changes, I got the third part of the code in Exercise Two to work and got this picture:

## Exercises Three and Four
These exercises talked about aperture photometry and corrections and seemed very related to each other. At the end of these exercises, I got a color map diagram. When I first ran the code essentially as it was, I got a very nice-looking diagram, seen below:

Afterwards, however, I changed the arguments of some of the functions to reflect a change I had made in the early code during exercise 2, and got a much less appealing-looking diagram, seen below:

I thought the code that generated the second image to be more correct, though the evidence seems to say otherwise. I'll have to figure out what's causing this change (since it almost makes more sense for the two codes to generate the exact same graph) and think about why, as it seems now, Python is reading a variable differently in the first part of the code than the second. 

# Conclusion
I'm close to understanding how to do photometry. I think getting this code working the rest of the way and figuring out how to modify it to work on whatever data I give it will give me a good understanding of this scientific procedure. I plan on doing more research, after this code works as I'd like, on how photutils works, how some of the commands in photutils work and wha arguments they take, and reading more about photometry generally.
