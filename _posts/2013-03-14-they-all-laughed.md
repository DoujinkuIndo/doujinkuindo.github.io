# They All Laughed — Ella Fitzgerald + Louis Armstrong

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6gX7yVob6w At the beginning of this year, my family and I drove out to Illinois from New York: a 21 hour drive split over two days. I got to soundtrack the whole thing: I made a mix CD of songs about New York ([Leaving New York](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCvnGxfBfiw) — R.E.M); I made a mix CD about the midwest ([Bloodbuzz Ohio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfySK7CLEEg) — The National); I burned [Illinoise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TboOfiTjhU) — Sufjan Stevens. I made a mix CD about driving ([Drive My Car](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7dkn1ZnIPk) — The Beatles). But the fun one was a mix CD about travelling. I went through my library and found all the songs about places; songs with the names of places in their titles. I had [Australia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHTSxw6zN1E) — The Shins; I had [Rome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sQdED3tpeo) — Phoenix; I had [Hello, I'm in Delaware](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRERWvDLHTc) — City and Colour. Most of my music I've gotten from other people; often mislabeled. (I'm looking at you, [Teenage Wasteland ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2KRpRMSu4g)— Baba O'Riley). Also on the travelling mix was [August in New York](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50zL8TnMBN8) — Ella Fitzgerald + Louis Armstrong, except it wasn't. It was the song _They All Laughed_ in disguise. I listened to it a few times before I realized something was wrong. I have so much Ella, I probably never would have found this old Gershwin song from 1937's _[Shall We Dance_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS9rCo-sA9Q). But it quickly became one of my favorite songs from the era. Funny how these things work.
