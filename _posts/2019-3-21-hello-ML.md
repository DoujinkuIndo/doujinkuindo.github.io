title: Getting started with Machine Learning

#### What is Machine Learning? 
It is a great topic to debate while drinking a beer. But apart from that, it is exacly what it sounds. Making a machine able to answer some questions/solve some problems.


#### What problems can be solved?

Things like classification, identification, projection, anomaly detection, noise reduction.

#### Classification 

One of the common application of ML is classification. Taken from Wikipedia:

```In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.```

So I'll try to produce a kind of hello world in terms of ML classification algorithm.

#### Tools

Data Science currently evolves around a few programming languages (Python, R, Scala, Matlab) and ready made API from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and alike.

For this tutorial I will try to implement a classification algorithm using Python and the commonly used library [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). The installation requires other packages as well, so I found [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) as a ready to use platform.

#### Problem

Given a set of messages and a set of categories, train the machine to output categories to new messages:

 | Message            | Category  |  
 | ------------------ | --------- |  
 | I want a new car   |  shopping |  



This will be a *supervised* classification, since I will first feed a data set with classifications already done from which it will learn to do new ones.

As an editor I will use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) whichis embedded in Anaconda and runs in your browser.
