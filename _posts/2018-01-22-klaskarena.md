## Overview

Klask is a table-top game akin to air hockey that we play in the office at Esri. The goal is simple: hit the ball in the opponentâ€™s goal using a piece on the table controlled by magnets under the table. We play a lot of Klask in the office and had no way to keep track of our wins and losses. We needed the ability to report games and keep track of player statistics over time.

## Solution

The solution was to create mobile application that could help us keep track. Since most of our coworkers are iOS users, Justin and I created an iOS app to help the office keep standings. Justin helped me with the design and I did the development work. There were a handful of Android users in the office, so a couple of my colleagues (Aaron and Dawit) built a similar Progressive Web App so they could partake.
