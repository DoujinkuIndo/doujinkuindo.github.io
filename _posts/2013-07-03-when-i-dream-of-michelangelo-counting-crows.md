# When I Dream of Michelangelo — Counting Crows

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0YYqCS3D9o It's very much a crapshoot, what I listen to at any given time. As a break from the relative monotony of living in the midwest, I tend to cherish my plane rides home — I make it a day trip, take the Amtrak up to Chicago, see a few sights, and take one of those brilliant story-high subways all the way to O'hare — kill a few hours, and get on a plane and watch the sun set from the runway. And the moment of takeoff — the moment of no return, I suppose — should be an ecstatic moment, of completeness and perfection. And I never know what to listen to during it. Sometimes I'll try to assemble playlists beforehand, but it's impossible to predict the takeoff itself to within a few minutes, and I don't want a song to be ending or beginning, I want it to be picking up, growing stronger. So I'll put it on shuffle, sometimes. I'll let pseudo-random algorithms have their way with my emotions. And it works — last time, at descent (same deal), this song came on. The rush of coming home, at least for a while, paired with a song like this. I can't even begin to describe. Listen to the song and imagine flying over a city of lights.
