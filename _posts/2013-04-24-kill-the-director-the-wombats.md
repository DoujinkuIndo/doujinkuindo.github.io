# Kill The Director — The Wombats

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrBYrZsp8tY This song is just SO BRITISH. It's deliberate, even, with _soaps_ and _Eastenders_ and the line about _carrots_ from the last World War, and  _Bridget Jones_. This band is marketing itself to British folks as being British, native, local, important and big; to Americans as being British, foreign and unusual and clever. And it is — it's traditional pop-punk, swaying and shrinking and exploding into dynamics; a steady drum, shouted call-and-response, it's all very by-the-numbers — not a bad thing. Its numbers make it listenable, fun, exciting. These guys who want to look like kids are in a smart, marketable band that wants to look like a little punk startup, and it works for them. It's just SO BRITISH.
