## The Setup

The Super Bowl is this weekend, and that means that large consumer-driven companies are going to be putting out some of (ideally) the best advertisements we'll see from them all year. All the staple brands will be there: Doritos, Budweiser, Pepsi, and yes, GoDaddy.

GoDaddy has always pushed the boundaries of what is considered socially acceptible in their advertisements. I remember when they were first airing commercials starring Danica Patrick, I thought they were a porn site! To be fair, I was a kid - and those commercials didn't even mention domain names! Given that, its kinda hilarious how much money I pay them for professional services nowadays! In recent years the company has toned back the blatant sexual innuendos of their previous marketing campaigns in favor of a more direct sense of humour relevant to the products they offer; and I love it.

Each year GoDaddy tries to push the envelope in some way. This is a great way to get attention brought to your product offerings, and I'll generally support it (unless, of course its the kind of shock value crap they used to pull - seriously, those old commercials were **not** okay). This year, they let their creation loose on the internet about a week early. That turned out to be a mistake.

## The Drama

After watching that ad, you probably had one of two (radically different) responses. I'll assume that you are either:

* Laughing hysterically
* Violently offended

Of course you could be both. That's okay too.

If you aren't offended by this particular ad-spot, that's totally fine too.

I showed this ad to my friend Eric, who is notorious for his extreme (yet brutally honest) reactions. I got the reaction I expected - horrified laughter. This commercial is really funny, but its [dark humor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy). Dark Comedy is my personal favorite genre thereof. It takes a sense of humor to rationally approach topics that are generally too difficult to open up seriously. Once a difficult topic has been breached by way of comedy, serious discourse can then make its way into the fold, and **that** is what inspires true change.

So is silencing this kind of humor the right way to handle this? I'd argue that it absolutely is not. 

See, this kind of thing actually happens. Puppy mills are totally a thing. Many people make a living off of breeding dogs and selling them online. My old roommate bought his pet husky from a local breeder (it was the only way to get on in the middle of Iowa). But when you take into consideration the amount of cats and dogs that are *put down* each year due to [overpopulation in local shelters](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html), this practice starts to look pretty shady - especially to animal rights groups.

So when a company like GoDaddy makes light of this practice through dark humor, its easy to get offended and ignore the real issue at hand: the topic being satirized.

Instead of directing violent outrage at the booming puppy mill industry, animal rights groups like PETA were able to put the pressure on GoDaddy to commit to **not** airing the ad during the super bowl. By appealing to an emotional response from their followers, PETA (and similar groups) are able to claim a victory *over* GoDaddy and subsequently further their corporate image.
