## The Drama

The Super Bowl is this weekend, and that means that large consumer-driven companies are going to be putting out some of (ideally) the best advertisements we'll see from them all year. All the staple brands will be there: Doritos, Budweiser, Pepsi, and yes, GoDaddy.

GoDaddy has always pushed the boundaries of what is considered socially acceptible in their advertisements. I remember when they were first airing commercials starring Danica Patrick, I thought they were a porn site! To be fair, I was a kid - and those commercials didn't even mention domain names! Given that, its kinda hilarious how much money I pay them for professional services nowadays! In recent years the company has toned back the blatant sexual innuendos of their previous marketing campaigns in favor of a more direct sense of humour relevant to the products they offer; and I love it.

Each year GoDaddy tries to push the envelope in some way. This is a great way to get attention brought to your product offerings, and I'll generally support it (unless, of course its the kind of shock value crap they used to pull - seriously, those old commercials were **not** okay). This year, they let their creation loose on the internet about a week early. That turned out to be a mistake.

## The Problem

After watching that ad, you probably had one of two (radically different) responses. I'll assume that you are either:

* Laughing hysterically
* Violently offended

Of course you could be both. That's okay too.
