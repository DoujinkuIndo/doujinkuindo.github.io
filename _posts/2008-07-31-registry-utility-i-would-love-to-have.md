I don't have this, but I certainly would use it.
A simple utility to do search and replace in the Microsoft Windows registry.

Ideally it would do the following:*Specify a list of values to delete - it would then remove ALL those values


*Specify a value and what to replace it with


*Specify a key and what key to replace it with


*Specify a key and what value to make it

My immediate use is removing entries that a virus (WORM actually) has entered in. Using regedit is a pain pain pain!
