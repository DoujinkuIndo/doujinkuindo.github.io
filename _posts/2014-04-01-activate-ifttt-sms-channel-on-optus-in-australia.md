How to activate the SMS channel on
[IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/) on the Optus network in Australia.

Assuming your mobile number was 0410 123 456.

Drop the leading zero = 410 123 456.
Add the Australian country code 61 to the front = 61 410 123 456.
Add 00 to the front of the number 00 61 410 123 456.
Remove all the spaces = 0061410123456.

Use this number (0061410123456) to active the SMS channel on
[IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/).

If this works for you on other networks in Australia, please let me know.

UpdateÂ 2014-05-12 : I've had a few people on Optus Post Paid that haven't been able to get this to work. It's worth noting that IFTTT also now has both iOS and Android notification channels available, they may do the trick for you.

Update 2015-04-22 :
[Alex Townsend says he has it working on Vodafone](https://twitter.com/lxtownsend/status/590724325092757505).

Update 2015-11-02 :
[Marissa Roberts has confirmed it's still working today](https://twitter.com/MarissaRoberts/status/660974888195244033).
