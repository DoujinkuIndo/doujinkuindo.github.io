Awesome! Generally I'm super happy to travel and speak at conferences and meetups, especially for keynotes and if you can provide support for travel costs.

Recently I've had to turn down a lot of speaking invitations, so figured I should explain properly.

At the end of August I'm getting married! Nick is a Google software engineer and [writes about machine learning frameworks and iOS development](https://harveynick.com). Unsurprisingly, wedding planning takes priority over speaking engagements until mid-September!

Wish me luck, and I'll see you around again very soon!
