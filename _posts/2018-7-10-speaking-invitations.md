title: "[July 2018] Would you like me to speak at your next event?"

Awesome! Generally I'm super happy to travel and speak at conferences and meetups, especially for keynotes and if you can provide support for travel costs.

Recently I've had to turn down a lot of speaking invitations, so figured I should explain properly.

At the end of August I will marry my brilliant partner, Nick. He's a Google software engineer and [writes about machine learning frameworks and iOS development](https://harveynick.com). This means that wedding planning takes priority over speaking engagements until mid-September. 

I'm be back on the circuit soon! As always, [tweet me](https://twitter.com/oicheryl) for speaking invitations.
