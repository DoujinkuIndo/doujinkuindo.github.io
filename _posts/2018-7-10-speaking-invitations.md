Awesome! Generally I'm super happy to travel and speak at conferences and meetups, especially for keynotes and if you can provide support for travel costs.

Recently I've had to turn down a lot of speaking invitations, so figured I should explain that at the end of August...

...I'm getting married! My brilliant fiance is called Nick and we got together when we were both software engineers at Google. He writes about [machine learning frameworks and iOS development](https://harveynick.com).

Unsurprisingly, that means wedding planning takes priority over speaking until mid-September. Wish me luck, and I'll see you around again very soon!
