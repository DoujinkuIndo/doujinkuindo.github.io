Awesome! Generally I'm super happy to travel and speak at conferences and meetups, especially for keynotes and if you can provide support for travel costs.

Recently I've turned down a lot of speaking invitations, so figured I should explain that at the end of August...

...I'm getting married! Nick is a software engineer at Google, and he also blogs about [machine learning and iOS](https://harveynick.com). We got together in 2014 when I was working at Google New York, before I moved back to London.

Unsurprisingly, that means wedding planning takes priority until mid-September. Wish me luck, and I'll see you around again very soon!
