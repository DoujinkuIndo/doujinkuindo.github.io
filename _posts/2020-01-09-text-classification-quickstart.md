title: Text Classification Quickstart
---
Last April my work sponsored an AI Hackathon in Belfast. We provided a dataset of bot generated and user written reviews and asked them to try and detect the fake reviews. Myself and a coworker ran a workshop to teach folks the basics of text classification and get to a working evaluated solution. 

So you have a collection of documents. And you want to create a machine learning model that will classify them. And you want it quickly. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/155b2UQKLVlrqRUaSzkKK_Cac_xhW4W0P" target="_blank">Well then have a look at the notebook we have created in Google Colab</a>. It's in Python and it will show you how to use scikit-learn (machine learning library), matplotlib (plotting library) and numpy(array manipulation library) to quickly hit the ground running when solving a text classification problem. 

Props to AI NI for organising such a fun and insightful Hackathon.
