title: UHF RFID Antennas - I - The basics
---

This is the first official entry to the blog!



So the other day I was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/PWzyPZAPbt0) and I thought "Hey I can actually do that!" (Design UHF RFID antenna tags). So I decided the first entries to this blog would be dedicated to UHF RFID antennas (I don't even feel qualified to qualify that idea...). 

I always found RFID technology very interesting. It's a shame that it is really obscured, especially the UHF. One can find some applications here and there, and many times don't even realize it's RFID. Still, I always get the feeling that it is a highly underrated technology, I mean, it has the potential to offer so much, but somehow, it's not so ubiquitous as it should have been. Think about it, it's a wireless communication system, where the mobile parts actually work without the need for batteries, but they can send data back to a transmitter without any local power source available to them. That's as close as we can get to 'wingardium leviosa' in our world (Well, there's many interesting techs out there that are rather magical, but this one is cool).
