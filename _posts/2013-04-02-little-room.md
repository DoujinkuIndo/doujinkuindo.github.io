# Little Room — The White Stripes

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OqveSybH0A It's okay for songs to be short, sweet and to the points; if something is minimal enough, distilled down to only its riff, only its chorus, only the parts that the artist thinks are exceptional, it's sometimes only seconds, a minute at most; lots of songs are repetitive in an attempt to become earworms, but those that don't have to are often cut down, short, exceptional, memorable. Most folk songs live on in tiny riffs; most pop songs are known in the public consciousness only by their choruses or hooks: this is the purpose of hooks. But The White Stripes know better: mostly real, old, roots rock, blues rock, garage rock; lo-fi, often drawing on New Orleans big-band and jazz overtones; theatrical and dark and angry, but always romping: Little Room is a synopsis, a triple distillation, and it sticks._ _
