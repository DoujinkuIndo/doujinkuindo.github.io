# FIRST LESSON:  ALERT AND CONSOLE

In html first do a **script label**.Then try the **alert command** _(just write alert in the script label)_ then open a bracket and in the bracket open a quotation mark.

You can write anything you want in it and boom :boom: you get what you wrote orrr... you can open new file and end it with .js then write the **alert** and the others and open a **script** label in html and write **src** in the start label right to the script with a space and next to **src** do an equal sign and a quotation mark.

In the quotation mark write your .js file and boom _(again)_ you got what you wrote!Some more JS features: In your JS file if you write **console.log** and write something inside if you right click on your website and click on the last icon then click to console in ther _(agaiiin)_ boom :boom: you got what you wrote and you can do console.error or console.warn they are cool too.

`See you on the next lesson` :wave:
