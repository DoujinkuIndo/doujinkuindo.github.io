# They Stood Up For Love — Live

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK463fcJebI I've never heard the end of this song. I got it from the library back in middle school, I ripped the CD, there was dust on it, the song skips and cuts out at 3:53, abrupt and like a record, cutting right to the next song in iTunes. I never bothered to fix it. Looking back now at what I listened to in middle school, it's super embarrassing. It's a new-age neo-rock band with heavily spiritual lyrics, overproduced and underwritten, vague and sentimental and catchy as all hell — I loved that organ riff, the clean drums, the dramatic vocals — all the things I like about Scissor Sisters, actually — but didn't notice the overt undertones (overtones?). Now it's just weird and uncomfortable to listen to, but I still do love it — if only for its context, the CD rack at the Morningside Heights library back when I was 10 or 11, going to the library every Sunday morning for years, without fail.
