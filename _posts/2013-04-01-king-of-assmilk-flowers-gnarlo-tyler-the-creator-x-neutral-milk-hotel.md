# King of Assmilk Flowers — Gnarlo (Tyler the Creator X Neutral Milk Hotel)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6jekqd6nA A [gnarlo](https://soundcloud.com/gnarlo) mashup of Neutral Milk Hotel's [King of Carrot Flowers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LULmbLlPvVk) with Tyler the Creator's [Assmilk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EGMQtzpy3M). Like all good mashups, it adds much-needed context to both songs. They are seemingly unrelated; _King_ is about Anne Frank and her explorations of love and prepubescent sexuality; it's taboo and sweet and slightly uncomfortable, but also terribly sentimental. _Assmilk_ is classic OFWGKTA, vulgar and violent and stunningly [clever](http://rapgenius.com/Tyler-the-creator-assmilk-lyrics); its trespasses of good taste, its homophobia and misogyny and horrible violent imagery must be forgiven as part of its camp, its self-awareness, its intentions to shock; underneath all this it's a fucked-up exploration of sex and sexuality, and so the two songs do go together. _Assmilk_ gains far better backing instrumentation; _King_ gains an edge. Together they are magical — _who thought to combine these_, but also functional, _wow, this works!_
