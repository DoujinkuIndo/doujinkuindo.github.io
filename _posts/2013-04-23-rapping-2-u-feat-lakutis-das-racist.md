# Rapping 2 U (feat. Lakutis) — Das Racist

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnC8Hm8GxNc This is the [best sample](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_sccg1CZzi4) I've ever heard. I'm going to say it again: this is the best sample I've ever heard. In case you missed it, the words 'best sample' back in that first sentence were a link to the sample itself. [Here it is again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_sccg1CZzi4). It's brilliant because it sees the source material and edits out the bad parts. The song itself quickly becomes too busy and incoherent, with bass and chorus and drums. But the sampler (here, Sha-Liek the Engineer) takes only the good part, like an intelligent hunter who knows they don't need to use every part of the animal. The lyrics of the rap song, while good, are nowhere near as impressive as the sample. Like, dang.
