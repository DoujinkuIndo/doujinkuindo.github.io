&#8230;of trying to get a gig.

Damien sends me an email yesterday saying the Sandringham offered his band (The Camel Tigers) a gig in October, as long as he finds 3 bands to round out the bill.

I&#8217;m not sure exactly why he thinks he needs my help but I&#8217;m pretty keen to help out, and I think it&#8217;s kinda funny that I&#8217;ve tried organising my own gigs a couple times in the past and it&#8217;s never worked&#8230; this time though I&#8217;m not even trying and it seems like it&#8217;s all pretty much organised within half a day.

Just waiting on a definite yes from one of the bands and then I guess it&#8217;s all good to lock in. Look like it&#8217;s going to be Sniperival, Kimbo (from Melbourne), Mr Vengeance (ex-Bagster guys) and of course Damien&#8217;s band. Should be good!

On another note, the next few weeks are huge&#8230;
