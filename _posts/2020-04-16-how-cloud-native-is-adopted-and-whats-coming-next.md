I'm speaking at the All The Talks virtual event to fundraise for the Covid-19 outbreak, plus how Slack is handling the huge surge in demand using cloud native infrastructure.

Thank you to the partipants for joining in the live poll and for sharing about you and how you run cloud native.

* People joined from Europe, Australia and New Zealand
* Just over 50% were backend developers and SRE/DevOps engineers.
* 60% are running containers in production, and of those running Kubernetes, all run 20 or fewer clusters.
* The biggest challenges are the learning curve and adoption across the team, which mirrors the 2019 CNCF Survey.
* 50% are evaluating service meshes, 21% have no plans to use a service mesh.
* 36% run stateful applications in production.
