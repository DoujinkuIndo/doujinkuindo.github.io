  Send signals of affection to your child interactively through Voice, Photo, or Text Messages.

- Emotional states:
  Track your child's emotional state in real time.

- Activities:
  Assign personal activities to your child and monitor his or her personal accomplishments.

- Teach in a fun way:
  Demonstrate your recognition for your child through resources such as Coinbox, Challenges and Rankings.

- Safety:
  Track your child's location during their activities.

- Events:
  Discover places and events your child would like to go with you.
