## Chapter 1: The way of the program
Thinking like a computer scientist combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.
* Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas, specifically computations.
* Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives.
* Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. It involves the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express solutions clearly and accurately.

### 1.1 What is programming?
A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, like solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial. It can also be a symbolic computation, like searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language.
* Input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device.
* Output: Display data on the screen, or send data to a file or other device.
* Math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division.
* Decisions: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.
* Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

So you can think of programming as the process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks. The process continues until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with the basic instructions provided by the computer.
