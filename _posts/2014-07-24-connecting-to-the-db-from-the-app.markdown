A few times I had to connect from the Application server to the Database and I'm always scrambling for the code on how to do it.

So this time, I decided to document it in my Github Gist as well as embed it in the blog.

Its a simple process, but again, this is just only related to Blackboard. Although in other circumstances it might help, you can use it or modify it at your convenience.

Obviously the SQL part can be modified to whatever you want and you can do anything afterwards as well.

In any case, its a simple process or at least repetitive task once you have it set up.
