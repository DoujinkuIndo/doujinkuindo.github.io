**Argument** - the Dharma was conditioned by the context of its time - the Dharma has mutated in many versions evolving in interdependency - Buddhism is not two, not one - clinging to "True Buddhism" leads to suffering - there are many wrong interpretations of the Dharma - the Dharma provides solutions to identify a wrong Dharma and avoid clinging.

As Buddhist, we are invited to consider all phenomenons as impermanent, empty of self-existence, and unsatisfying (anicca, anatta, dukkha). But when we approach the Dharma itself, it is easy to disregard those considerations entirely and cling to a Dharma that is absolutely true. It is a mistake, the Dharma is, on the contrary, a fluid intellectual construct.

If you haven't already meditated on how _anicca_ and _anatta_ apply to Buddhism itself, here are a few notes to make that point rationally instead.

# True Buddhism is a fiction

## The Dharma is empty of self-existence

There is no Dharma, Dharma is empty of self-existence.

Reading "Theravada Buddhism - A Social History" by R. Gombrich, I was surprised to see how many core concepts of the Dharma had been conditioned by the brahmanic spiritual and social context. It was conditioned either by assimilation or by opposition, sometimes by bringing them further, or answering key questions of that era.

- p.42, language as a guide to reality
- p.43, breadth as an underlying principle for atman
- p.43, _"those who did not understand the truth [Veda] of the unity underlying all phenomena were condemned to perpetual rebirth"_
- p.46, the Buddha ethicized the concept of _Karman_, previously in Hinduism ritual and moral obligations remain lumped together
- p.47, _brahmacarya_ (litt. brahman activity) is a period of chaste studentship of Vedas _"followed by retirement from wordly affairs and devoting oneself to relition, to improve one's fate after death"_
- p.47, for Brahman, _"desire kept [some]one in the world, in society, and so ensured the continuance of that society"_
- p.47, the [brahmanic] theory of _Karman_ offers untestable and irrefutable explanation that disagreeable occurences must be the results of one's acts in former lives
- p.48, there wer _"full time savation seekers"_ for which _"if life in society brings only rebirth, it is only life outside society which can bring escape from rebirth"_
- p.62, _paticcasamuppada_ mentioned here, which reinds me of the reding of Joanna Jurewicz

This does not "invalidate" in any way the Buddhist Dharma architecture. No but, it just reminds us that this architecture, the whole framework of the Dharma, is **conditioned**. The Dharma doesn have one origin, or any essence outside of its context.

## The Dharma is impermanent

Clearly, the Dharma is

I think we put the Dharma in a unique position, we give it a specific status, free from conditioning. It is as if the Buddha, because he had an experience of Enlightenment, and because we consider this Enlightenment to be an absolute, an actuality detached from conditions, then the Dharma itself is absolute, free from the contingency of the experience of Enlightenment.

## Buddhism is not two, not one (interlude)

Buddhism is not two, not one.  
Buddhism is an ocean. Buddhist schools are waves.  
Illusion has led them to having formations of their own, become self-aware, take name and form.  
These waves have stretched, clashed over new territories, in contact with new cultures with a dynamic of their own, conditioning their formations to change, die or renew.  
Buddhism has a _paticcasamuppada_ of its own.
