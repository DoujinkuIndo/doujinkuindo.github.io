    Because my inside is outside<br /> My right side&#8217;s on the left side<br /> &#8216;Cos I&#8217;m writing to reach you<br /> But I might never reach you<br /> I long to teach you about you<br /> But that&#8217;s not you
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It&#8217;s good to know that you are home for Christmas<br /> It&#8217;s good to know that you are doing well<br /> It&#8217;s good to know that you all know I&#8217;m hurting<br /> It&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;m feeling not so well
  </p>

    Because my inside is outside<br /> My right side&#8217;s on the left side<br /> &#8216;Cos I&#8217;m writing to reach you<br /> But I might never reach you<br /> I long to teach you about you<br /> But that&#8217;s not you<br /> Do you know it&#8217;s true<br /> And that won&#8217;t do
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe then tomorrow will be Monday<br /> And whatever&#8217;s in my head should go away<br /> Still the radio keeps playing all the usual<br /> And what&#8217;s a wonderwall anyway
