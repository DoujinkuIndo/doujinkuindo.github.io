# Baily's Beads

![tumblr_mlydsnw4Sv1qbn5m1o1_1280](http://literals.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tumblr_mlydsnw4sv1qbn5m1o1_1280.jpg?w=300)Baily's Beads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads) are the tiny points of light that flicker around the edges of the lunar disk during an eclipse. During a [lunar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse), the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun when viewed from Earth. Because the Solar System is constantly moving, the [apparent sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter) of the Sun and Moon — that is, how large they appear in the sky — vary. At worst, they're within 11% of the same radius; at best, they can be [exactly the same size](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=apparent+size+of+the+sun%2C+moon). During eclipses, this produces an interesting effect: when the Moon passes in front of the Sun, it is a tiny bit too small, and hints of sunlight trickle in around the edges, filtered through by mountain ranges and craters on the [surface of the moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography_of_the_Moon). This filtering of light — obscured where there is, say, a mountain, and let through where there is a valley — produces a beading effect around the rim of the lunar disk, called Baily's Beads. Fantastically, this effect was measured and recorded as far back at the 18th century, in a painting by [Cosmas Damian Asam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmas_Damian_Asam), a German painter/architect. This [painting](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080128.html), located in [Weltenburg Alley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltenburg_Abbey), depicts a Bailey's bead streaming down from the blacked-out sun.
