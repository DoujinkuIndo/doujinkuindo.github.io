title: Hello World!

This is my first blog post, using my new Jekyll/GitHub Pages website. I'm currently tweaking the layout and researching how to add additional features. I looked at a few options for creating a personal website/blog - such as WordPress and Blogger, both of which I have used before, and are very user-friendly but quite clunky. 

I have had a GitHub account for a few years, and keep the code for all my personal/hobby projects in there. I knew GitHub Pages existed, but had never really looked into it before. Once I discovered that it also used Jekyll to build a static website - giving great performance with the minimum of setup, I was hooked.

It's also been a good opportunity to look at some new web frameworks and approaches which I haven't encountered before, namely:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/):  a simple, blog-aware, static site generator written in Ruby
* [JekyllNow](http://www.jekyllnow.com/): a pre-configured GitHub Pages blog which can be forked and customised
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): a scripting language used to generate CSS
* [YAML](http://yaml.org/): a human-readable data serialization language, commonly used for configuration files

I will be adding content as and when over the coming weeks, so please check back soon.
