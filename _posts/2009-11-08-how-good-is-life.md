Been enjoying an amazing weekend. Kicked it off on Friday night with the work crew at the bar across from the office, and in a moment of alcohol-aided revelation, it finally hit me what kind of project I want to start. I also apparently had some interesting thing to say to Mel on msn, I plead not guilty. Gonna miss that kid when she&#8217;s gone for 2 months.

Saturday morning the revelation was still there and pretty much the whole weekend I&#8217;ve been thinking about this project. World domination shall be mine next year.

So I&#8217;ve been spending the weekend finally kicking back to Nirvana&#8217;s Live At Reading DVD (every bit amazing as I hoped and dreamed), getting my way into Season 6 of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and discovering a load of bands. It&#8217;s been a bit of a geeky let&#8217;s-try-finding-new-stuff kind of weekend for me. Currently losing my shit to [Title Fight](http://www.myspace.com/titlefight/).

I don&#8217;t know why I wasn&#8217;t put onto these guys earlier, but they rule&#8230; I&#8217;ve also been giving [Man Overboard](http://www.myspace.com/manoverboardnj) a bit of a listen. Not so convinced on them but they go alright for a bit of a casual listen.

Forgot to mention we had Lee Kernaghan come into work on Friday. Genuinely nice dude. We even wound up on his twitter:
