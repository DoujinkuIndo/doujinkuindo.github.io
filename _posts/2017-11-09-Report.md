**THE FUZE BOX**

What went well about the fuze box?

**What have I learnt about the fuze?**

The fuze has been really fun; I have used it as an opportunity to work with people I wouldn't normally work with in class.

**______________________________________________________________________________________________**

**1.1 of the fuze!**

In 1.1 of the fuze Bible, we didn't do much, however we did manage to make the words, 'Hello world!’ pop up onto the screen. This, at the time, seemed like an amazing accomplishment like climbing a mountain. 

For this section of the fuze I worked with Aaryan.

**1.2**

In 1.2 of the fuze, we learnt how to change the colour of the font and the background. It was fun at first but then turned into an evil weapon; people started to make hypnotic and flashy colours like royal blue and red, however, it was still enjoyable!

For this section I had changed partners and joined Loc.

**1.3**

For 1.3 we learned how to make a song! It didn't actually play music, but it showed the lyrics scrolling on the screen so that we could sing along! Firstly, we made a song about eating apples! Then we made PPAP in fuze song form!

**Finally, 1.4**

In 1.4 we had to use the homework that we had to do- we made little pictures of aliens, or whatever we wanted- we made loads! I really enjoyed this section because when we made lots of them the same picture, with one alter each time, then it would give a stop motion effect and make it look like it is moving!

**2.1**

In this section we made sums and passwords.

For sums all we did was make some variables and call them 1, 2 and 3. Not all we needed to do was make sure the sum made sense. I enjoyed doing this because it was funny when it said ‘2+2=2’.

For passwords and age guessing we needed to made a way to make sure that when you typed in the right age/ password it said “Well done!” and when you got it wrong it said “Nope!”. I liked how Loc and I had to guess each other's passwords. Then we moved on to ages. We had the faze say, “What’s my age?” and if you then put under 20 it said- a little older. If you put over 79 then it said, “How rude!” and finally, if you put between 70 and 20 then it said, “Close!” so you could never actually get the age right!

I liked this because it felt like the fuze was given emotions.
