**THE FUZE BOX**

What went well about the fuze box?

**What have I learnt about the fuze?**

The fuze has been really fun; I have used it as an opportunity to work with people I wouldn't normally work with in class.

**______________________________________________________________________________________________**

**1.1 of the fuze!**

In 1.1 of the fuze Bible, we didn't do much, however we did manage to make the words, 'Hello world!â€™ pop up onto the screen. This, at the time, seemed like an amazing accomplishment like climbing a mountain. 

For this section of the fuze I worked with Aaryan.

**1.2**

In 1.2 of the fuze, we learnt how to change the colour of the font and the background. It was fun at first but then turned into an evil weapon; people started to make hypnotic and flashy colours like royal blue and red, however, it was still enjoyable!

For this section I had changed partners and joined Loc.

**1.3**

For 1.3 we learned how to make a song! It didn't actually play music, but it showed the lyrics scrolling on the screen so that we could sing along! Firstly, we made a song about eating apples! Then we made PPAP in fuze song form!

**Finally, 1.4**

In 1.4 we had to use the homework that we had to do- we made little pictures of aliens, or whatever we wanted- we made loads! I really enjoyed this section because when we made lots of them the same picture, with one alter each time, then it would give a stop motion effect and make it look like it is moving!
