Two great speakers from  JFrog and Shipa joined us at our August Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [UMATR](https://www.umatr.io/), and [Netapp](https://www.netapp.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Our first speaker was Melissa McKay from JFrog kicking us off for the evening with a discussion of Distroless Docker Images (starting at [24:53](https://youtu.be/slWceFvOL4Y?t=1493)). She explained that:

* Docker has an interesting history and virtualization is not a new thing!
* It is essential to understand how Docker images are composed in order to build images that are efficient and safe for production.
* Distroless Docker images are one option to help you build smaller and more secure images.

Then Bruno Andrade from Shipa wrapped up our evening by discussing Implementing an application level approach to GitOps  (starting at [56:47](https://youtu.be/slWceFvOL4Y?t=3407)). His takeaways were that: 

* GitOps goes beyond Kubernetes when an application centric approach is taken.
* To be effective, it needs to close the operational loop.
* Focusing on the application can help you improve developer productivity 

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
