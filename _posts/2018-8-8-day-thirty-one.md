I started out today by running `calcsky` on the next three folders then siccing `dolphot` on them. This is a long process, but I got four 
more folders worth of data. I spent more time looking through dolphot's output, and feel comfortable that I could find whatever data points I need. Dr. G left a comment on [yesterday's post](https://thom-ory.github.io/day-thirty/) advising me to look the quality flags in the data to filter them, and I have found where those are in the data, though not looked thoroughly into using Python to filter the data based on those quality flags.

# Conclusion
Python is the next move. I have experience making diagrams with Python, so I'm not very worried about color-magnitude diagrams.
