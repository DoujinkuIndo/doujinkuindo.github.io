Figured it was time to go out a bit more on my own, and a CMS seemed overkill for hosting static pages like I had been doing. Jekyll and Github Pages is perfect, and lets me focus my AWS instance as an API for some of the tools I'll be listing here.

I just need to learn Markdown, which doesn't seem like it will be too bad once I get the hang of the syntax.

Anywho, here we go! (Again.)
