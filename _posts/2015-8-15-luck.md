I have always believed in luck, but only because I know the power of belief. Luck is often perceived as this volatile and otherworldly force that comes and goes as it pleases. However in most cases, what people refer to as luck is merely the manifestation of opportunity derived from skills they themselves do not fully understand. Luck is simple and predictable, and like any other skill, you create it. Always plan on being lucky, but work as if luck wasn't in the plan. Take more chances, be more active, show up more often, and luck is yours for the taking.
