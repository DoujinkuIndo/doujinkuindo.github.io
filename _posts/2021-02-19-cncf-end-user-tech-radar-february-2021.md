I present the February 2021 edition of the CNCF End User Tech Radar, featuring what end users use for Secrets Management.

Full announcement: [CNCF Provides Insights into Secrets Management Tools with Latest End User Technology Radar](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2021/02/23/cncf-provides-insights-into-secrets-management-tools-with-latest-end-user-technology-radar/)

I lead a panel discussion with the CNCF End User Community Radar team, where we discuss what they expected going in and what they found most interesting or surprising:
* Steve Nolen, RStudio
* Andrea Galbusera, Authkeys
* Two further panellists who contributed but could not record the webinar

Visit [radar.cncf.io](http://radar.cncf.io/) to see all past editions of the CNCF End User Tech Radar, the quarterly report on what end users really use and recommend.
