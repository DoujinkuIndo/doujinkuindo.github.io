# What is Azure ?
Itâ€™s a Microsoft  cloud like google cloud, AWS, many more!. I am still trying to figure out how azure works.
Great place to launch your cloud platform!, well for me, it has been.
I have been using azure for over a year now, learned how to deploy VM, WordPress, with jump box that would increase security.
So here is some collection of things I learned.

# Github pages to Azure

Now, I have been using GitHub pages for 1 years and more. I was looking for a free blog making site for my projects that I work on.
It's a great idea, by the way!
So first I forked the Jekyll repository from [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Here is the tutorial to set up [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
Once I had [my site](https://pkharsimran.github.io/) working on GitHub, started to work on azure. To understand azure I jumped into free docs available by Microsoft, practised a lot.
Azure web apps is able to deploy your site on azure, where you can also add your own custom domains.
Where you can also use analytics services to get in depth data on how many, how long the users visit your site!

Some benefits of using azure static web apps ------>

- Global hosting (you have option to deploy your site closer to your targeted customers for faster speed and more!)
- Any [fronst-end language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks) works!
- Pay as you grow. So my doamin cost me ($20 and I pay $1 monthly to host it on azure ;) )
