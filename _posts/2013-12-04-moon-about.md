title: Dimensional Analysis through Brute Force

---

*Project*: **[Moon Unit](http://ambuc.github.io/moon/).**

WA dimensional analysis engine based on the [SI Base/Derived Units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit). Uses input on the seven base units (mass, distance, time, electric current, temperature, luminous intensity, and amount of substance) to display many common derived units of measurement. Basically a unit calculator.

Designed and built by [Julian](http://julianrosenblum.com/) and me.
