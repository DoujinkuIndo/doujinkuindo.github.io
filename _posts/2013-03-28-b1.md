# b1 — Ólafur Arnalds & Nils Frahm

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2uKFrJrS8 I was sent this song, and clicked the link; the first impression: oh, god, it's thirteen minutes, how am I going to listen to a thirteen-minute neoclassical song, but I can't just reject this outright, and it starts playing, and it sounds repetitive; it sounds repetitive and it keeps sounding repetitive, and then it kind of tricks you into minding it carefully, and you find little patterns and subtleties and suddenly it's been five minutes and you don't really mind, and you can't stop listening, the patterns and the repeating beats are as natural as silence alone would be, you feel like you'll lose something if you turn it off, it has to keep playing: you surf the web while it plays, you watch other youtube videos with their audio off, you read articles and then take a break to fold some laundry, and the music is still going, it's only been ten minutes, there's three minutes left, thank god, is this what all classical music is like? And then it's over.
