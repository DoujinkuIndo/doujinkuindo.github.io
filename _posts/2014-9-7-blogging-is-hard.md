title: Blogging is Hard 
---

Blogging is hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. My partner once admitted that articulating his feelings in writing was like attempting to breath under water. Anyone who has ever struggled to articulate their thoughs or feelings clearly in writing understand this. 

Now, combine the agonizing process of articulating your thoughts and feelings in writing with making your expositions public. At that point I come to terms with the prospect of drowning and start gulping water into my lungs. The last sound I hear as I sink to the bottom of the blogo-sea is my ego tearing itself apart, "What if it gets comments? What if **nobody** looks at it?" 

Maybe I'm being dramatic.

The ironic part is that [I do this for a living](www.linkedin.com/in/eadiesn/). I've been writing blog posts that successfully drive traffic to small and medium size businesses for the better part of three years, now. You'd think I'd have the hudspa to get over myself and write my own damn blog, but I don't. I'm chicken. 

When I think about writing a blog, my three biggest mental barriers are:

1. I don't know *what* to write about.
2. I want to write about *a lot* of different things.
3. I'm *intimidated* by what other people have already written about these topics.

I imagine these fears are pretty common. 

But if Drizzy taught me anything, it's that you have to start somewhere, and that somewhere is usually the bottom. If you start at the bottom, one day you'll get to wear every single chain, even when you're in the house. If that sounds fun and cool to you, too, let's get cracking at this blogging thing together.

# Lessons in Stick-to-Itness

To prove to myself that everyone starts somewhere, even my seemingly inapproachable favorite people on the internet, I took a look at the 10 most recent posts from a blogger I like and compared them with the 10 oldest posts.

The blogger I chose was director slash advice columnist Jennifer Peepas. Jennifer P writes as [Captain Awkward](http://captainawkward.com/) on her blog of the same name. She writes about a whole mess of things I care about, like healthy relationships, career success, and mental health. Her post, [How to Tighten Up Your Game at Work When You're Depressed](http://captainawkward.com/2013/02/16/450-how-to-tighten-up-your-game-at-work-when-youre-depressed/) had me like:

And I've been hooked ever since.

Man, I don't envy someone trying to start an advice column blog. There's this whole chicken and egg problem, right? You need content to drive poeple to your site so that they read your work and ask questions. But you can't write an advice column if you don't get reader submissions. A lesser person would give up, or sit on their hands waiting in vain for the letters to come flooding in. Fortunately for the internet, Captain Awkward did no such thing.

Instead, she did something really smart.

Of her first 10 blog posts, only three are responses to reader letters. To gain momentum, Jennifer began by writing [her own takes on advice from other columnists](http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/07/how-to-say-stfu-when-the-f-is-silent-and-other-mantras/), [critiques of news articles](http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/07/all-that-crying-is-killing-my-boner/), [analyses of popular online content](http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/08/the-power-of-vulnerability/), and [relevant personal experiences](http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/07/midwestern-manners-i-cannot-eat-the-last-cookie-unless-i-offer-it-to-you-first/).

When Jennifer wasn't receiving receiving the request for advice, she proactively wrote content to bring people to her blog. Once they saw content on her site about things that she was interested in, they 1) had proof that the blog wasn't a ghost town - she was committed to the project, and 2) got a better sense of her personality and the topics that interested her.

The pressure to start your blog and become a Thought Leader can be oppressive. What if instead, you began by analyzing, critiquing, or summarizing news articles or posts by your favorite bloggers? While it may be painful to look back on in the future, it gives you the type of forward momentum that sitting on your hands agonizing over blog topics **doesn't**. 

## 10 Most Recent Posts

Fast forward three years and 619 reader-submitted questions later and Captain Awkward's blog has blown up. Of her last 10 posts, eight of them are requests from readers for advice (almost the exact inverse of her earliest 10 numbers). One of those posts is a funny and clever series she created called, '(It Came from the Search Terms)[http://captainawkward.com/?s=it+came+from+the+search+terms]'. And, last but not least, one of those posts is for a Meetup in the Twin Cities (!!!). Not only does she have a devoted group of readers writing in for advice and leaving thoughtful comments on her post, but people like and care about her blog SO MUCH that they want to hang out in person. 

# Look at the Archives

Batting out of your league can be a mixed blessing. Looking forward and trying to emulate my heros motivates me and keeps me focused. However, sometimes you have to take a step back and say, "Where did this work come from? How did this person get where they are?"

If I walked into work tomorrow and tried to act like my boss, it may have a positive impact on some elements of my work life, but I think I'd also eventually be fired. Co-workers would balk at my insistance on being invited to board meetings, and focusing on strategy while ignoring implementation would leave the most important parts of my work untouched.

Instead, I should be thinking and asking about what my boss did when she was in my position to get where she is now. How do you go from being a Marketing Analyst to being hired as a VP? 

Blogging is no different. Find your favorite blog posts and **read the archives**. What were your favorite bloggers doing to get started and maintain momentum?
