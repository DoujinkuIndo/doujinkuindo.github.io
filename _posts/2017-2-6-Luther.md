## A New Challenge and Venture

For our second project we got to collect and clean our own data that we scraped from a site of our choice. I love movies and decided to investigate horror movies. I avoid this genre as much as I can during my day to day, so I saw this as a good chance to rub shoulders with these neglected movies.

##IMDb

There are a few movie sites with many charts, ratings, and comments from users.

Initially I contemplated using the-numbers. IMDb is a goldmine of movie data.  


##Scraping and Cleaning, oh the Cleaning

One of the important steps for this project was the data collection. We had the option of using either Beautiful Soup or Selenium to scrape webpages for our data. For more involved scraping Selenium comes in handy since it acts as a user and can click, select, enter text etc. Beautiful Soup simply scrapes the HTML of the page without any interaction with the front end of the site.

For my project I used Beautiful Soup and scraped 3048 horror movies from IMDb. It was not completely clear how much information I would need, so I decided to scrape as much as I could. I ended up with a healthy set of variables to potentially utilize when modeling the data. I also scraped Box Office Mojo's average tickets per year price table which I used to adjust the gross each movie made. A ticket back in 1910 was 10 cents, whereas today's average ticket price according to the site is $8.65.

Putting the two tables together I had {title	mpaa	duration	genre	imdb	metascore	text	directors_all	stars_all	reviews	gross	intyear	price	tix}.
