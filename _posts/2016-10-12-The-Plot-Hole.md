Based off of my data recording the names of speaking characters, I was pleasantly surprised to find that so many speaking characters were given to women. In a show like Supergirl, one would hope that women characters would have significant roles, but this is not always the case. It seems today that the default is male centered media, this is something that has been recently very concerning to me.

This article lists some of the most sexist shows on television, some of these shows are portrayed as shows with a female lead:

As a consumer, I try my best to avoid shows that make women seem unimportant, or even worse, shows that consistently use sexual violence to carry the story along. One show that has been repeatedly accused of this is Game of Thrones. Worse, after the rape of one female character, the writers found a way to spin it as an event of distress for a male character.

Our study of this has made me even more aware of how much this happened, and how long it has been happening. Over the weekend I watched The Godfather with my little sister, and although an incredible movie and a wonderful classic, I was horrified by how little women spoke, and how when they did speak it was nonsense or stupid. I almost wanted to pull out my gender timer and capture some data on it, but I was too busy trying to put it out of my head and enjoy the movie. I have found that Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where the minimization of women characters completely ruins a good plot for me, I can no longer enjoy a show or movie that minimizes women/trivializes women struggles.
