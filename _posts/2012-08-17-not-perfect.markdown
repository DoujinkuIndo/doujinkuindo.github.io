<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>She's not perfect. You aren't either</strong>, and the two
of you will never be perfect.
But if she can make you <em>laugh</em> at least once,
causes you to <em>think</em> twice, and if she admits
to<em> being human</em> and making mistakes, hold onto
her and give her <em>the most</em> you can. she isn't
going to quote poetry, she's not thinking
about you every moment, but she will give you
a part of her that she knows you could break.
<em>Don't hurt her, don't change he</em>r and don't
expect more than she can give.
<strong>Don't analyze.</strong>
Smile when she makes you happy, yell when
she makes you mad, and miss her when she's
not there.
<strong>Love hard</strong> when there is love to be had.
Because<em> perfect girls don't exist</em>, but<strong> there's</strong>
<strong>always one</strong> girl that is <strong>perfect for you.</strong>
--Bob Marley</p>
