My old beloved Palm T3 PDA, which in my humble opinion is possible the best PDA I've ever used, is now used by my daugher. She set the system password... and forgot it... oops.

Thusly, to reset it to factory defaults, and in the process, lose ALL saved data on it, you need to press and hold the POWER button, while pressing the reset button (hidden on the back). Once the "Palm Powered" logo appears, release the POWER button, say YES to erasing all the data, and Bob's your uncle, all reset to factory defaults.

Unfortunately the Palm doesn't have a phone in it, like the company provided PDA, hence why I don't use the palm any longer.
