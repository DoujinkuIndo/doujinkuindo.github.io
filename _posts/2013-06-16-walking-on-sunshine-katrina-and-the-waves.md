# Walking on Sunshine — Katrina and The Waves

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPUmE-tne5U This song ought to speak for itself — it is unblemished, happy and peaceful and full of life and love, music without the pretenses of needing to be real, without the hassles of communicating the singer's obscure sorrow (I'm looking at you, _The National__)_, without needing to be innovative or sexy or anything. It uses an established musical vocabulary that _Katrina and The Waves _heard growing up, associated with good vibes, and spat back out when it was their turn. And that's perfect, that's the way it should be. I can't even think of a feel-good song from the last ten years.
