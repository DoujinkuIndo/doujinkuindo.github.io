  - Stream 2 Brightspace submissions
    1. Double check your Skulls to make sure they're all there.
    2. Schedule a time with Tony if you need more Skulls based on your final projects.
    3. Tony will send you a `yaml` file of your accumulated Skulls (minus trophies, for now) to submit to Brightspace (still working on the dropbox).
- Adjustments to Trophies
  - Due to potential conflicts with SAIT policy, only the following Trophies will be advertised tomorrow:
    - MVP
    - Coach of the Year
    - Perfect Attendance
  - If we want more Trophies included, we'll have to:
    - nominate and vote as a class, or;
    - define objective requirements for awarding a Trophy.
