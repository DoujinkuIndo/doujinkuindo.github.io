JAX-RS 2.0 ([JSR 339](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339)) has been slightly revised through the JCP Maintenance Release process and has recently passed the JCP [MR ballot](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=5725). This update (JAX-RS 2.0 rev A) is mostly about clarifications (including JavaDoc clarifications) and some fixes in Jersey, the JAX-RS Reference Implementation. The updated documents will be published soon on the [JSR 339 page](http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/jaxrs-2_0_rev_A-mrel-eval-spec/index.html) but in the meantime, you can check [this page](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr339/index.html) for details about the changes of JAX-RS 2.0 rev A.
It should be noted that GlassFish 4.1, the Java EE 7 Reference Implementation, already supports this version of the JAX-RS specification (i.e. JAX-RS 2.0 rev A).
