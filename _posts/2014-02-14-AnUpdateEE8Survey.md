There is a common pattern between a survey and a call for papers, i.e. you always get (a lot) more submissions towards the deadline! Part 2 of the Java EE 8 Community Survey will be closed this Monday 17th (midnight Pacific Time). Once Part 2 is closed, we will need at least a week to digest, consolidate and summarize all the results. So around the end of the month, we should be able to share those results, i.e. the emerging most-wanted features for Java EE 8, with community. At the same time, we plan to open the final part of this community feedback effort, the prioritization survey.

~~So if you haven't yet filled Part2 of the Survey, you only have a few hours left!~~
