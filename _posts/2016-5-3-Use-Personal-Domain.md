title: Use Personal Domain!
---

I'm trying to use my own domain for this blog. I researched into pricing and server availability of different DNS service providers. Considering company reputation and customer service I choosed AWS Route 53. Besides, AWS Route 53 connects user request to other AWS infrastructure like EC2 instances (which I am using now), Elastics Load Balancer, AWS S3 bucket. AWS Route 53 partnered with Gandi. So don't get surprised when you see Gandi's information showing in your WHOIS site. 

Next step, checked for availability of domain name. Tried with my first name and last name but no luck! After several tries I tried with my email address maggie98choy.com. Good, this one had not been taken! I quickily registered with this name. I didn't give second thought about the top-level domain name other than .com as this is most common one. AWS Route 53 charged $12/year for domain name registration.
