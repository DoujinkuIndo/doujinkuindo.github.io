title: Creating a landing page from scratch.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/landing.jpg)

I really enjoyed a small project in Thinkful’s curriculum, it was to create an HTML and CSS Page from a design. In the past I have used frameworks and platforms like Bootstrap, and [Pinegrow](https://pinegrow.com/) also Wordpress and [Duda Mobile](https://www.dudamobile.com/). I have enjoyed using these frameworks they're very useful but what I found is that I really didn't have that great of knowledge CSS an semantic HTML as I thought. 

So thought I would get a little bit more practice and create a landing page from scratch.

In version 1  I used floats and positioning managed to get it done, but I was anxious to try Flexbox So I went and did some googling and found these  resources that were very helpful!
[A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) also another good resource
[Solved by Flexbox](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/) If you use Sketch here are some great [Landing page examples](https://sketchrepo.com/?s=landing+page)

I found with Flexbox it’s a lot less CSS to write, and you get a lot more responsiveness right out of the box. This site only has only 1 media Query for the nav only. [Here is my project live](https://mikehaslam-thinkful-projects.github.io/myLandingPage/) also if you want to checkout the code  I have a [repository on Github](https://github.com/MikeHaslam-Thinkful-projects/myLandingPage) it still needs a lot of work, if you have any ideas let me know. Or you would like to work on this project let me know?

For version 2 I would like to implement React and break elements down into small reusable  components, so that is my next challenge with this project.
