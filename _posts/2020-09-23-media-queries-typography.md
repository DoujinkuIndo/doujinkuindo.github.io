## Activities
### 1. Card Hunt
You will be working in groups of 3 or 4. Find as many examples of card designs. Take screen caps of the most common configurations.

### 2. Hero taglines
You will be working in pairs for this activity.
1. Add a tagline to the heading in your hero code from yesterday. For simplicity, use a `p` element for this.
2. Import 2 of your favourite fonts from Google Fonts.
3. Using differences in typeface and `font-size`, create a visual hierarchy between the hero section heading and tagline.
4. Are there any other changes you can make to enhance the visual hierarchy of the entire hero section?
