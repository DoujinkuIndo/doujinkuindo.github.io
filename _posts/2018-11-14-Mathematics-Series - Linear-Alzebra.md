# Mathematics Series - Linear Alzebra 

Machine learning is one of the most hot topics right now. But before diving into this topic we need proficiency in some major topics in mathematcis i.e. Probability, Information Theory, Linear Alzebra, Diffrentiation and Integration. 

I will be discussing Linear Alzebra in this blog. I will also write a blog about the remaining topics in the upcoming blog so please stay tuned.

# Linear Alzebra
A good understanding of linear alzebra in essential for understanding and working with many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms.


## Terminology 
1. Scalar - A scalar is just a single number.
I will be writing Scalar in small letter italics. For example
@equation(id)
x = \sum_{i=1}{N} i
