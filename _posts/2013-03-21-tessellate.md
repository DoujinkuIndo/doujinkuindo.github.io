# Tessellate — Alt-J

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPH89HIBLiw One of the great pleasures of music is finding new timbres. Unlike instruments (of which there are far too few) and scales, chords, and harmonies (which number so few that comprehensive mathematical analysis can be performed), timbre is infinite and varied; combinations of timbres create new timbres, becoming more diverse, like patterns, rather than less, like color. So we get infectious drums and organs and guitars, and a whiny operatic voice; slurred speech and a dry reverb snare drum; bells and a little echoing string section; each alone is novel, together they are incredible, like nothing I've heard. And I pay attention — the lyrics stand out as exceptional _because_ the voice fits in to the weird collage so well. It's something new and different and there's simply no _need_ to analyze it, because enjoying the crunchy bit-crushed guitar is enough to validate the music.
