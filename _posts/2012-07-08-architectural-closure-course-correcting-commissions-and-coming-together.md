# Architectural Closure: Course-Correcting, Commissions, and Coming Together

Things come together. The site is suddenly working terribly well. I'm salvaging my music into one-minute snippets. I'm getting my schedule. I'm taking commissions. I'm course-correcting on the subway with minutes to spare. Gears are turning and things are falling into place. Occasionally I'll get a flash of something that seems like it could have been, but wasn't, a larger part of my life. A friend I once knew incredibly well who I don't anymore - not because we are lost, but because I keep a little voice of them in my head all the time, and they I. It's just not needed after a certain point, and we send out updates every so often. Or a neighborhood I once was about to get to know intimately, and then suddenly didn't. But I still have the impression it made on me, and when I went back it was still there, ready to flood me with finally resolved memories. Architectural closure. The thing on my nail is a speck. A day from gone. Things come together, things fall apart.
