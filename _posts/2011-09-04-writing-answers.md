Older post from
[Joe Chernov](http://www.jchernov.com/) on
[how to write a great online answer](http://darmano.typepad.com/logic_emotion/2011/03/answer.html) (i.e. Quora).

I've printed out his post and stuck it to the wall here. The key points he makes are:
- Be the first to answer.
- Include links and/or graphics in your answer.
- Stick to a word count of 100 to 200 words.

I like this because all to often we we need to answer a client or co-workers question, using his guidelines makes for a more succinet answer, which means it is more likely to be read, and in turn, acted upon.

But don't take my word for it, [go read his post and get it direct](http://darmano.typepad.com/logic_emotion/2011/03/answer.html).
