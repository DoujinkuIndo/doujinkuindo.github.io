# Seville — Luiz Bonfá

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAny1bIApcA Sampling is an essential part of music, but it's often frustrating. There's a little twinge of rage in discovering, years later, that a song which you loved for a particular riff and whose artist you gave credit for its genius was sampling the riff from another, older artist — as if we gave credit to someone for imitating Shakespeare, but forgot about Shakespeare entirely. Gotye's_ [Somebody That I Used To Know](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY) _is a great example. Luiz Bonfá's _Seville _(above) is the original, a brilliant 1960s instrumental from the Brazilian jazz/folk scene. Am I mad? Yeah, a little. But I also firmly believe that sampling is an integral part of music — modern and not. So I have some cognitive dissonance on the matter. Luiz Bonfá's [The Shade Of The Mango Tree](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=GZqOA0-KRC8) was also sampled for Nujabes' [Lady Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=qjqTiQhOgU8) — but I'm less mad, as Nujabes made a career off of sampling wonderful jazz and adding beats and guest rappers. Still, I wish more of the music I knew came with citations.
