# Decade — Esbjörn Svensson Trio

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKzIiCZu9_A There's something elusive about the present, and every once in a while I manage to slip out of it; to see the world around me as though it were some romanticized past; New York became the street of Buenos Aires in the 1920s, full of mystery and wonder; no more construction, no subway logistics. The night air held possibility and an infinity of people, some of whom were having the same frisson, the same transcendence. I get it late at night, mostly; obscurity and shadow let my imagination take over; I get it in crowds of people, or on the train aboveground, or in a new part of the city. I can't claim that _Decade_ is about that feeling, but it is for me.
