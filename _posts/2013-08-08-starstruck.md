# Starstruck

For twenty miles around, our town left a residue in the sky. The ambient lighting from the street lamps bleeds up from the horizon like ink, coloring the sky too light a shade of black. So we were out in the farmland, racing along County Road 700 E through the Type 2 farmlands full of inedible corn. Corn destined for ethanol, not consumption. Out there, light pollution dips below two standard deviations from the norm; suddenly the sky opens up like a lens.

I was following the blue dot as the world shifted beneath it, turning off onto roads named after longitude and latitudes. Soon we came to a turnoff, and the blue dot shifted from its orbit, onto an unnamed, unmapped dirt road.

Velocity blurs color and shape into streaks on canvas, but the fragile corn stock had no detail, no resolution — there was only a deep, rich shade of brown. In the corn, all speeds converge into one. Driving speed. We crept along the dirt road for an undefined time at an undefined speed, covering an undefined distance into the private plot of land. Looking out the back, I couldn’t make out details past fifty meters receding. The only light came from the car and the bright half moon above.

We came to a small locked shed, and looked up.

In daytime, we are hidden from the oppressive infinity of creation. This is a gift — to walk beneath the heavens at all hours would simply be too much. How could anything matter before the majesty of the universe? How could we motivate ourselves to pursue modest goals in light of the ultimate superlative, the infinity itself? So we are hidden from it, and it from us — and these rare, transformative experiences are left to the small hours.

In the city, there is no visibility. There is no time to contemplate, and no clarity to achieve. Light pollution from the boroughs has obscured all but the moon and the North Star; passing planes to JFK and LaGuardia punctuate a deep, rich haze of color long after the sun sets, as light bounces through the smog from New Jersey. But out here, the star field was brighter and more dense than anything I had ever seen before. I was starstruck, a city boy.
