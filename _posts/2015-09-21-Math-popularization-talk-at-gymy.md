title: Math popularization talk at GYMY
---

As [advertised a few weeks ago]({{site.url}}/Red-Hat-Internship-part1/), today, on Sep 21 2015 at 8:00 AM I gave my math-oriented talk at the [high school](https://gymy.edupage.org) I graduated from a year and a half ago.

I had agreed with a former teacher of mine to host a short, hour long session on math (and a bit of computer science)
to get the (mainly senior) students interested in
[STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields "Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics").

After I introducet myself a little bit, we started talking about the field in general, how I got into university
and how I chose to [study Computer Science](http://www.studuj-matfyz.cz/) at [Matfyz](http://mff.cuni.cz).
We then set forward to explore some fun mid-level math problems, mainly the
[100 prisoners problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem) and a few others.
After the students exhausted their daily math-appetite, we had a short Q&A session about their and my plans for the future,
about [life at a university]({{site.url}}/My-first-year-at-Matfyz/) and how I got my internship.

I hope to have influenced and encouraged at least a few students from the crowd to aspire towards a STEM-oriented career,
or at least to demonstrate that math can be fun, too.

P.S.: Here is a [link to my slides]({{site.url}}/2015_popmath_gymy/).
