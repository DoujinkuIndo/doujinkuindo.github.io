title: Hello, Twitter 4 for Mac

Twitter promised earlier this year that they would be revamping their client for Mac, and today is that day.

The new client is very clean and looks as though it belongs on El Capitan. It does a great job at blending in, while still showing off that classic Twitter blue and a couple of new features—my favorite feature is the ability to choose between a light and dark mode.

While I won’t be switching from Tweetbot anytime soon, the new Twitter app is definitely worth trying out—it is free after all. Head over to the Mac App Store and take the new Twitter client for a spin.
