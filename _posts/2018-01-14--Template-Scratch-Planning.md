**Year 7 Scratch Project Handbook**

By half term, you will have created your own game using Scratch. (don't worry, you can do it!)

It can be any sort of game you like. Your research should have given you a range of ideas and possibilities. 

Working through this handbook will take you to your solution!

**Step 1 **

Planning

* What is your game about?

* How will you win/lose or start/end the game?

* What needs to be in your game? 

**Step 2**

Designing

* What sprites will you need?

* What resources will you need? 

* What variables/broadcasts/custom blocks?

**Step 3**

Building

* This is the longest stage and will comprise several weeks and homeworks. 

**Step 4 **

Evaluating

* Have you achieved what you designed? 

* Test your game and the games of others.

**Step 5 **

Improving

* Once you receive feedback, what are you doing to do? 

* Make your game better. 

Step 1: Planning

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What is your game about? Name it. Describe the gameplay/how it is played. What is the purpose of the game?
Add a description below to tell me about your game. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Star wars Galaga. 
The purpose of the game is to destroy all other enemy ships and to pick up power ups to help with that process. Also the other purpose is to survive all of the levels and destroy all ships without losing to much health from the health bar. 
So if I press the up, down , left and right bar the ship will move in that direction.It is a single player game and a first person shooter. This game will be on scratch. There will be a sprite which is shot from the millenium falcon sprite when the spacebar is pressed.
At a random time an enemy ship will come gliding across the screen shooting a different coloured sprite towards the millennium falcon sprite and the player has to glide out of the way. 
Every time the player hits the enemy ship they gain 50 points and if they destroy a ship and it explodes they gain a further 100 points.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How will your game be won or lost? 
Make sure you add details here. Be precise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The game will be won if all 5 levels are complete ( where the sprite you control does not blow up  and all enemy ships are blown up. The game will be lost if the sprite that you control blows up by getting hit by the enemy to many times.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What elements need to be in your game? 
Describe/list what might need to be in your game: A fisherman that is trying to hook fish; the basket to land them in, etc. This part needs plenty of detail. Be thorough.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> If the sprites health bar is on a low level a health pick up will appear on the screen and if the sprite touches this pick up they will gain 50% more health. 
When either the sprite you control or the enemy sprite explodes there will be a big boom on the screen accompanied by an explosion noise. All of the ship sprites will be equipped with a gun drawn on scratch so they can shoot at their enemies. 
Each enemy ship will be hit twice before then making the explosion noise and picture. However the Millenium falcon sprite will be allowed to be hit twenty times before blowing up.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Project Checklist**

**Originality**

Is your project original or a remake of another project?

It is a runner game so the game is obviously quite similar to many games but there will be a different twist that will make it original.

**Creativity**

Is your project creative and is it different and unique?

It is a unique game in the sense that it is based in the mountains instead of elsewhere.

**Backgrounds**

Do the backgrounds/stage add to and enhance the product?

The background will show what the game is and add to the product. It will hopefully invite more people to play the game.

 

**Sprites**

Do the sprites/costumes you chose add to and enhance the product?

The monster sprites will make the game much harder and more exciting. The old wizard will explain what the game is about.

 

**Scripts**

Do the Scripts make the sprites effectively do what you want them to do? Do you have correct x y coordinates? Do you include "forevers" where needed, etc.

Yes the scripts will make sense. I will think twice before I code.

 

**Purpose**

Is the purpose of the product evident to the audience?

Yes, there will be notes at the beginning from a wizard. There will be a tutorial

 

**User-Friendly**

Is the product user friendly? Did you include notes to help the user know how to manipulate the product?

Yes, there will be notes at the beginning from a wizard.

Step 2: Designing

What Sprites will you need? Describe the Sprite and detail what it will do.
