# Shook — Emancipator (Mobb Deep X Sigur Ros)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVEwemk-TRU _Sigur Ros_ has never quite done the trick for me; I need my music to have driving rhythms, even if it's ambient; nothing downtempo for me. When I first heard this around a year ago, I thought it was merely a remix some Sigur Ros song; when it kicks into high gear around 1:01, it is transfixing, chopping and filtering and switching between vocals and chants and backgrounds, two layers of already indistinct gibberish further removed from context, built into a layered quilt of texture and sound — and then the rap section begins at 2:00, another minute later. The lyrics are unrelated; I love the contrast between the abrasive, violent lyrics and the peaceful backgrounds, mediated by a chopped midtempo beat, made of _Sigur Ros _but made to fit _Mobb Deep_. The two artists have never — will never — meet or collaborate, but somebody (Emancipator, here) thought they should, and they were right.
