title: Keeping up to date as a software developer
---
Introducing.. well me
---------------------

I am a professional software developer (or at least employed one ;) ) for about 8 years, and programming in some way for about 17 years. Actually my first programing language was in my mother tongue (Hebrew), surprisingly or not, which was based upon turtle language in a afternoon course in junior high which got me hooked and still going strong.

So why am I writing this blog, you maybe wondering, it's because one of my most important ideals of sharing my knowledge which ties in my mind very tightly to this blog subject. Which started when I have been asked a couple of times in the past few weeks on how I keep up to date as a developer, so this lead me to reflect on my way with this post. And I am looking forward for the possible followup conversations and to learn something new.

Why
---

During my first programming job, I had a "very deep" thought that "I must stay relevant, up to date" but I did not know how to do that. As I gained more and more experience, I have learned the importance of gaining wide knowledge which contributes a few very good very important benefits:
Wide knowledge can introduce concepts, ideas and even tools for in visioning new features or improving the current ones. Which could extend the tool belt with new knowledge about architectural concepts, tools and standard practices. Or even spark new interest personal or even career wise.

How
---

So how to tackle this important task: in my mind it's an ongoing way of life, like a doctor that reads a medical journals, goes to medical conventions, checks out his colleagues' work and more (a lot more) so we need to always practice it and it will become or inspire a very interesting part of your work. After a bit of philosophy let's get down to the specifics:

* General curiosity - My grandfather always said "always learn when someone is helping you". Always ask why, do not take things as they are. Explore always when given a task to do, look to your right and left. Your colleagues (discussions, reviews to you and to them)
* Share knowledge, *always with everyone*, you can be surprised when you're wrong (What?! NO..) or out of date, use the time the other people spent in exploring those topics. And even you are correct and out of date that will give some practice in convoying ideas and being a leader.
* *GitHub explore* - I like to check weekly (or when I remember) the [trending projects](https://github.com/trending) in the languages I use currently or interested in, and I look for cool new projects that trends in the open source community (the wisdom of the masses). I think this is a very fun and easy way of finding currently relevant projects and more specially inspiration for future projects.  
* Articles feeds
* YouTube videos - There are a lot of conventions around the world on a very wide range of topics (from language specific, different fields, frameworks and etc) which make their lectures extremely accessible through filming and posting them to a YouTube channel platform. So this allows on your own time to catchup on probably any topics that youâ€™re interested, this due to this wide abundance. Another great way of finding interesting videos is via following the channel of the companies you wonder how they work (or interested working in), they are actually a collection of videos for conventions the company's people had given.
* Podcasts - Like YouTube videos there are a lot from around the world on a very wide range of topics, and this is a great medium because you consume it while on the go with just a pair with headphones. I recommend subscribing to a lot of podcasts, because probably you will not like all the content and it's nice to always have interesting content to listen and also it will give you the same value as GitHub trending (so also an interesting topics to explore without "saving" the time in listening not interesting chapter).
* Meetups - Because of limited free time or chance I only go to some meetups which are a great source of information and creating connections with your colleagues, so this also very much in line of my ideal of sharing the knowledge. Besides actually going there are two other ways of enjoying that information, one is via meetups that record their sessions and publish on a YouTube channel (which of course is great!!). And the second one is the GitHub trending experience, so subscribe to a lot of meetups and enjoy the trending topics, but *go to meetups* and support the organizers that do this on their on time and without no payment (THANK YOU!!).
* Online courses - Of course they are a great resource of learning, but I think this is out of scope of just "getting up to date" because the main goal is to easily (somewhat easily of course) widen your view and knowledge and not necessarily deep-in. But this is a great next step when you encountered something you found interesting.

Conclusion
----------

Although this seems like a huge task and cumbersome with a little (or very much) philosophical view of my, but in a practical view these options are a part of the possible tool set of every programmer and you must find out what works for you. Because if this won't be easy and hopefully fun for you it will not happen, so try really try and see what works for you there is no silver bullet.
