title: How do I keep up to date as a software developer
---

I have been asked a couple of times in the past few weeks on how I keep up to date as a software developer, so this lead me to think about what that actual means to "keep up to date" does this means broad general knowledge or in depth knowledge at your specific area of expertise.  


Why
---
In my first programming job, I had a "very deep" thought that "I must stay relevant, up to date" and it's easy. So that "easy" task became the first thing to be left aside as life and work progress for a long time, until it became a large task that I don't have the time or the sheer willpower to this. As I gained more experience I realize that there are a few very good very important reasons to do this:
* Gives you inspiration and ideas for in visioning new features or improving the current ones.
* Of course gives larger tool set for designing.
* Can help open new path ways in your career or for your hobbies.
* Will help you to be more efficient.

How

So how to tackle this important task: in my mind it's an ongoing way of life, like a doctor that reads a medical journals, goes to medical conventions, checks out his colleagues' work and more (a lot more) so we need to always practice it and it will become or inspire a very interesting part of your work. After a bit of philosophy let's get down to the specifics:
* General curiosity - grandfather saying "always learn when someone is helping you". always ask why, do take things as there is. Explore always when given a task to do, look to your right and left. Your colleagues (discussions, reviews to you and to them)
* Share knowledge, *always with everyone*, you can be surprised when you're wrong (What?! NO..) or out of date, use the time the other people spent in exploring those topics. And even you are correct and out of date that will give some practice in convoying ideas and being a leader.
* *GitHub explore* - I like to check weekly (or when I remember) the [trending projects](https://github.com/trending) in the languages I use currently or interested in, and I look for cool new projects that trends in the open source community (the wisdon of the masses). I think this is a very fun and easy way of finding currently relevant projects and more specially inspiration for future projects.  
* articles feeds
* YouTube videos - There are a lot of conventions around the world in a very wide range of topics (from language specific, different fields, frameworks and etc) which make their lectures extremely accessible through with filming and posting them to a YouTube channel platform. So this allows on your own time to catchup on probably any topics that youâ€™re interested, this due to this wide abundance. Another great way of finding interesting videos is via following the channel of the companies you wonder how they work (or interested working in), they are actually a collection of videos for conventions the company's people had given.
* Podcasts
* Meetups
* Online courses - Of course they are a great resource of learning, but I think this is out of scope of just "getting up to date" because the main goal is to easily (somewhat easily of course) widen your view and knowledge and not necessarily deepin. But this is a great next step when you encountered something you found interesting.

Conclusion
----------
Although I have been a little (or very much) philosophical in view of the important of this, but in a practical view those options are a part of the possible tool set of every programmer and you must find out what works for you. Because if this won't be easy and hopefully fun for you it will not happen, so try really try and see what works for you there is no silver bullet.
