title: How do I keep up to date as a software developer
---

I have been asked a couple of times in the past few weeks on how I keep up to date as a software developer, so this lead me to think about what that actual means to "keep up to date" does this means broad general knowledge or in depth knowledge at your specific area of expertise.  


Why
---
In my first programming job, I had a "very deep" thought that "I must stay relevant" and it's easy. So that easy task became the first thing to be left aside as life and work progress for a long time, until it became a large task that I don't have the time or the sheer willpower to this. But after I gained some experience I realize that there are a few very good reasons to do this:
* gives you inspiration and ideas for in visioning new features or improving the current ones.
* Of course gives larger tool set for designing.
* Can help open new path ways in your career or for your hobbies.
* Will help you to be more efficient.

How
---
So how to tackle this important task: in my mind it's an ongoing way of life, like a doctor that read medical journals, goes to medical conventions, checks out his colleagues work and more (a lot more), so we need to always practice it and will become a very interesting part of your work. After a bit of philosophy let's get down to the specifics:
* articles feeds
* Your colleagues (discussions, reviews to you and to them)
* GitHub explore
* YouTube videos
* Meetups
* General curiosity - grandfather saying "always learn when someone is helping you". always ask why, do take things as there is. Explore always when given a task to do, look to your right and left.
* Share knowledge, *always with everyone*, you can be surprised when you're wrong (What?! NO..) or out of date, use the time the other people spent in exploring those topics. And even you are correct and out of date that will give some practice in convoying ideas and being a leader.

Conclusion
----------
Although I have been a little (or very) philosophical in view of the important of this, but in a practical view those options are a part of the possible tool set of every programmer and you must find out what works for you. Because if this won't be easy and hopefully fun for you it will not happen, so try really try and see what works for you there is no silver bullet.
