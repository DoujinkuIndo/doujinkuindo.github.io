title: Thoughts on how to stay relevant as a software developer
---

I have been asked a couple of times in the past few weeks on how I keep up to date as a software developer, so this lead me to think about what that actual means to "keep up to date" does this means broad general knowledge or indepth knowledge at your specfic area of expertise.  


Why
---
* gives you inspiration and ideas for everyday problem solvings.
* Of course gives larger tool set for designing.
* Can help open new path ways in your carrer or your hobbies.

How
---
* articles feeds
* Your colleagues
* github explore
* YouTube feegs
* Meetups
* Genreal curiosity - always ask why, do take things as there is
* Share knowledge, always with everyone, you can be surprised when your'e wrong (What?! NO..) or out of date, use the time the other people spent in exploring those topics. And even you are correct and out of date that will give some practise in conving ideas and being a leader.
