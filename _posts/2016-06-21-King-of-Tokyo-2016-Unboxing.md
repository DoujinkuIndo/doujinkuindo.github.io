There's a new version of King of Tokyo out with brand new artwork. The game is exactly the same as before, but got a facelift to match the upcoming mobile version of the game.

The new version also sees two new monsters, Space Penguin and Cyber Kitty.

KOT is a hot game in our household, and the new edition was met with much excitement by me and the kids.
