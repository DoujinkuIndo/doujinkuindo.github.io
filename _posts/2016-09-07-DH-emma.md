title: "What is digital humanities?"

Honestly, I am still trying to understand digital humanities. I can't even decide whether or not I should capitalize it. But as research has taught me, my definition can change and develop over time. So as of now, my understanding of digital humanities is the addressing and collaboration of media, literature, history, art and anything else under the humanities umbrella through digital tools and mediums (Burdick).
