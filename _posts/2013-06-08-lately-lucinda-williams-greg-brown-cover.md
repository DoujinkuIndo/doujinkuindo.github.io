# Lately-- Lucinda Williams (Greg Brown cover)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu7kN4E0psU This is a cover of a Greg Brown song, but I’ve never heard him do it. Lucinda Williams’ version feels more like a place than a song, and it would be too weird to hear someone else sing it. Like taking a new friend to old places you’ve long since abandoned, or at least pretended to. When you’re showing them around, nothing looks quite like you remembered, and you can’t explain why. This song has the sort of ache that makes me miss things and people that are still happening.
