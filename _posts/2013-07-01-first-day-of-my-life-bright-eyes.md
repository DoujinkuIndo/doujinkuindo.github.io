# First Day of My Life — Bright Eyes

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwFS69nA-1w I've noticed a shift in this journal. The earlier songs were less about the songs themselves and more about my emotional connections with them — where I remember first hearing them, what I associate with them, and occasionally what I think of them. Slowly, I began moving away from that, and into more of an actual music discussion journal, and I'm not sure if I like that. I first heard Bright Eyes on a train — one of those enclosed, isolated environments, where there's not much to do but consume or produce. You can't wile away the hours — or, at least, I can't. I have to be doing something, all the time. Bright Eyes had been hyped for me, I was told it was brilliant and sublime and deeply emotional. So I didn't listen to the music at all. I was deeply judgmental of the sparseness, of the wavery voice, of the weird inflections and rhythms. Only listening to it now, much later, I do actually untangle the mess of associations — what I expected to hear on the train, what I wanted to hear on the train. I talk a lot about prescriptive and descriptive music — how some music picks you up, and some music keeps you down. This is too raw, I think. I can't sort it.
