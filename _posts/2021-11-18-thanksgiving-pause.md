title: Pause for Thanksgiving
---

It's mid-November, where Thanksigiving is fast approaching! (Wow!) **I'm going to pause on publishing War(un)lock blog post for mid-November and the beginning of December.**

I'll be spending time in Atlanta to enjoy the holidays with friends and family. I also wanted to minimize the stress as I come back to NYC and get back into a routine between the holiday seasons. I will post an end-of-year blog post in mid-December, where I'll reflect on the gap year in 2021.

Until then, **Monty and I wish you all a good and safe Thanksgiving!**
