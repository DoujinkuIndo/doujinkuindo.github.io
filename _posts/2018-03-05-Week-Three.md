## Goals

#### Improve typing speed

I feel like I've gotten a bit better at touch typing; I've noticed that I'm looking at the keys less as I type. I don't think my actual speed has improved much yet though, and I do still look at the keys sometimes, so this is something I will need to continue to work on.

#### Practice git and vim commands

I didn't get to this at all (four goals was probably too many!) so I will try to work on it next week instead.

#### Finally finish reading _New Programmer's Survival Manual_

Done! See below for notes on the book.

#### Get more confident with Javascript

I have definitely improved my Javascript. It is similar enough to Java that I've always been able to muddle my way through, but it was really good to finally learnt it properly. I went through the Code School introductory courses, best practices courses, and Node.js course. It was very useful to learn things from a Javascript perspective, since the way it deals with functions and objects in particular is very different from Java. I found Node also very interesting, since I haven't formally learnt about callbacks before.

## Next Week's Goals

With three full days taken up with workshops next week, I think it's best to aim for smaller (and fewer!) goals.

* Use more hotkeys

* Practice git and vim commands
