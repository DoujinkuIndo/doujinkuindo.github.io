# Walkaways — Counting Crows

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDd9YVpkgO8 This is one of those songs that ended up bound to a certain time in my life — in this case, a weekend in 2008 or 09 when I went down to Philadelphia to visit my cousin in Wharton. We stayed in his unfurnished apartment and slept on air mattresses, and during the day went out and toured the city itself. It was a new city, and I was old enough to walk around by myself. It was raining up the promenade to the Philadelphia Art Museum, and suddenly I had this glimpse of what life would be like in the future — going to college and living somewhere _different_, living by myself or with _new people_. And I was young, and I had this album on my iPod, and somehow the two got linked. The song was about separation and a new city and so was that weekend — although, that weekend cast a tone on the weekends I would spend up in Boston, or at a friend's house in CT, or even whole summers in PA.  It was different and foreign and there was a strange joy in that, but also a sadness, like knowing that this would soon stop being an excursion from real life and start being it.
