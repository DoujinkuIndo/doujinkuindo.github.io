In two previous posts [SQL Reporting Services and Dynamics NAV Option Strings: Part 1 ](http://billwarnke.com/2009/10/19/sql-reporting-services-and-dynamics-nav-option-strings-part-1/ "SQL Reporting Services and Dynamics NAV Option Strings: Part 1")and [SQL Reporting Services and Dynamics NAV Option Strings: Part 2](http://billwarnke.com/2009/12/05/sql-reporting-services-and-dynamics-nav-option-strings-part-2/ "SQL Reporting Services and Dynamics NAV Option Strings: Part 2") I created a way to enable option string values to be used with SQL Reporting Services. I've removed the links and moved the solution up to Github: [https://github.com/eknraw/SSRS-Dynamics-NAV-Option-Strings](https://github.com/eknraw/SSRS-Dynamics-NAV-Option-Strings) Open to updates from anyone.  I'll migrate to 2013/2013 R2 as I have time.
