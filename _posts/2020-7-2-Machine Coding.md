Machine coding round involves solving a design problem in a matter of a couple of hours.

It requires designing and coding a clean, modular and extensible solution based on a specific set of requirements.

An example of a machine coding problem could be to design a snake and ladder game with certain requirements and constraints.

This is generally followed by a code review process where an interviewer goes through the code and tries to understand the design decisions.

Flipkart, Uber, Swiggy, Ola, Cred, etc. are some of the top tech companies where the first onsite round is the machine coding round.
