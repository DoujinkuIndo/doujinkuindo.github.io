title: My first TrueNas Scale üñ• build üèó
---

For many years, I had a [QNAP TS-853 Pro](https://www.qnap.com/en/product/ts-853%20pro) with 4x 2TB WD Red disks and 4x 3TB WD Read disks.
The hardware was (is) very reliable and still running.
In fact, I use this NAS now as my backup of the current build.
However, the software (QTS) of QNAP is horrible for anything advanced.
The kernel is outdated, the security weak, and putting proper security in place really cumbersome.
For instance: only the `admin` user account could be used to `ssh` into the NAS.
At the same time, QNAP recommended disabling the `admin` account for security reasons.
Doing both at the same time wasn't possible.
For 5+ years???
