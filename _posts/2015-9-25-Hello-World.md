title: Migrated the site to Jekyll
---

Hello world!

I just finished migrating vessia.net to Jekyll.  My plan is to have a mostly technical blog that will document my journey into the field of software development.

For those who don't know, Jekyll is a simple static site generator that is very blog friendly.  It's made using Ruby, and integrates really well with GitHub.  I originally made this site with HTML and CSS just to learn, but I've had an itch to start a blog recently as I enjoy reading them and often wish I had a place to document my own adventures.  My friends like to joke that our facebook group chat becomes my blog at times, so hopefully this will give them some peace.
