title: Hello world!

Welcome to **War(un)lock**, an eldritch tome of knowledge, experience,
and opportunity. A blog cataloguing my journey to the unknown,
recorded by **Susanna Dong**.

### What is this blog?

Before leaving my last job, I told folks that I will be taking a
gap year off. Many folks asked if I was going to record my experiences.
I caved in and finally set up a blog again!

The goal of the blog is mostly based on experiences from my gap year.
This blog’s content may range from travel, things I’ve learned over
the past few weeks, my thoughts splattered into text or drawings,
and whatever comes to mind.

That being said, this blog is going to be a living experiment. The blog
aesthetic or post structure may be subject to change!

My plan is to structure each blog post with the headers:
1) What I've been up to - something I've been doing that is more in the
realm of "slice of life". It may be a fun thing I've visited, or simply
chilling in my home.
2) What I've learned - a cool thing I've learned which I'll deep dive
into. Think more about "these are the gas laws and why they're important
to know about".
3) What I've seen - a random but recent photo on my phone.

As a preview:

### What I've been up to

I've been spending time setting up this blog in GitHub Pages,
and registering the domain name.

Fun fact - warlocks are one of my least-favorite Dungeons & Dragons
classes to play, yet have the coolest vibes.

### What I've learned

Medical insurance in the US is stupid expensive! Since I'll be paying
my gap year out-of-pocket, I've been spending time to manage my
finances and insurance.

### What I've seen

While this isn't a super recent picture, I've come across some wall
art in Manhattan that gave a cool aesthetic that I would craft into
this blog!
