title: Hello world!

Welcome to **War(un)lock**, an eldritch tome of knowledge, experience,
and opportunity. A blog cataloguing my journey to the unknown,
recorded by **Susanna Dong**.

### What is this blog?

Before leaving my last job, I told folks that I will be taking a
gap year off. Many folks asked if I was going to record my experiences.
I caved in and finally set up a blog again!

The goal of the blog is mostly based on experiences from my gap year.
This blog’s content may range from travel, things I’ve learned over
the past few weeks, my thoughts splattered into text or drawings,
and whatever comes to mind.

That being said, this blog is going to be a living experiment. The blog
aesthetic or post structure may be subject to change!

My plan is to structure each blog post with the headers:
1. *What I've been up to* - something I've been doing that is more
in the realm of "slice of life". It may be a fun thing I've visited,
or simply chilling in my home.
2. *What I've learned* - a cool thing I've learned which I'll deep dive
into. Think more about "these are the gas laws and why they're important
to know about".
3. *What I've seen* - a random but recent photo on my phone.
4. *A chapter closed* - the equivalent of the conclusion.

As a preview:

### What I've been up to

I've been spending time setting up this blog in
[GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/),
and registering the domain name through
[Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/domains).

I've asked some of my fellow colleagues on what sort of tech stack
they've used to power their blogs, which included Netlify and Hugo.
I've also considered creating my own static website through cloud
object-store buckets, or setting up a Wordpress website. In the end, I
settled with GitHub Pages because:
* It saved me from creating another online account, as I already had a
personal GitHub account.
* GitHub Pages has free hosting and HTTPS support, while offering
flexibility with Markdown content and Jekyll static site generation.
* This blog hosting gave me vibes of the early 2000's, where the
internet was still indie and experimental and quirky.

Once I got the tech stack settled, I could concentrate more of the
branding! I wanted something less formal and more quirky, so I combined
the journal-like blogging with my nerdom with Dungeons & Dragons.

Fun fact - [warlocks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock)
are one of my least-favorite Dungeons & Dragons classes to play,
yet have the coolest vibes.

### What I've learned

*Medical insurance in the US is stupid expensive!* Since I'll be paying
my gap year out-of-pocket, I've been spending time to manage my
finances and insurance. While I felt secure taking a gap year without
making money, I definitely didn't want to bleed more money than
necessary. However, as the world is still in a pandemic at the time
of writing, I definitely didn't want to risk getting seriously sick
or injured without insurance!

One option was the
[Continuation of Health Coverage (COBRA)](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/cobra),
which would allow me to continue paying for the same insurance I had
in my last employer. However, I found out that I could be paying
$500 per month!

I found a type of insurance called a
[catastrophic health plan](https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/catastrophic-health-plans/),
which allows certain qualified and healthy individuals to pay for
cheaper insurance every month (premium). However, this health plan
has a much higher deductible, which means I would spend more
out-of-pocket before my insurance would cover the cost. I found this
insurance through the NY Health Plan Marketplace. This type of
health plan would cost $300 per month - a $200 difference!

And to add insult to injury, I was unaware that enrolling to a new
medical insurance plan would have to be done before the 15th of the
month in order to be covered for the next month. I was fortunate
enough to go through some phone calls to make an exception.

In slightly related news, dental and vision insurance were enrollable
independent of medical insurance. From the insurance company I
enrolled with, both would cost a total of around $30 per month.

### What I've seen

While this isn't a super recent picture, I've come across some wall
art in Manhattan that gave a cool aesthetic that I would craft into
this blog!
