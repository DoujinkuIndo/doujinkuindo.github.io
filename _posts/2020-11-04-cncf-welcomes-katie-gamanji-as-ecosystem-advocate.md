I'm so incredibly excited to welcome Katie Gamanji to CNCF!

Katie has been a friend for a few years, a frequent speaker at many events including Cloud Native London. I feel very lucky to have her as a colleague.

> The End Users in the CNCF Community are the companies and organizations that put our open source technology to work, increasing efficiencies, productivity, and profitability. They are critical to driving innovation that matters, and to keeping our open source ecosystem ever expanding.
>
> That is why we are very excited to welcome Katie Gamanji to CNCF as the new Ecosystem Advocate, where she will help develop and execute programs to expand the visibility and growth of the End User Community. Katie will play an important role in exposing original insights from cloud native end users through formats like the CNCF Tech Radar, which will influence the future of CNCF projects and scale access to this community.

> Katie joins CNCF from American Express, where she was instrumental in driving cloud native technology adoption at the company. She has been involved with CNCF since while at Conde Nast, she created a centralized globally distributed platform with Kubernetes as a central piece. Since then, her interest in cloud native tooling has grown tremendously, as have her contributions to the community. In February 2020, Katie was elected to the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) as the end user representative. In this role, she worked with 11 other members to guide and set the technical vision for the CNCF landscape.
