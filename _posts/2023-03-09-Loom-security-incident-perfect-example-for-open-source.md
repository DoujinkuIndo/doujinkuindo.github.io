I swear it wasn’t us!

But what a coincidence that the day after we launch an <a href="https://sorbay.io" target="_blank">open source alternative to Loom</a>, they have a security incident.

Now I’m not going to sit here and bash Loom as a company because I think that they handled it very well.

Vinay Hiremath, their CTO, was quite transparent on the issue and communicated the problem in under 24 hours of detecting it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At approx. 10:21am PST yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/loom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@loom</a> went through a security incident. This situation sucks. We&#39;ve let our users down. But we&#39;ve root caused and remediated. This is a technical overview of what happened.</p>&mdash; Vinay Hiremath (@vhmth) <a href="https://twitter.com/vhmth/status/1633631115113103362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, knowing that customers had access to other peoples videos is a major red flag.

Loom and its proprietary competitors are great for marketing, sales and information that is not sensitive. But when it comes to private and internal communication, not being in control of your recordings is a major concern.

Imagine you're a company that deals with cryptocurrency and while reporting a bug via a screen recorder a public key is shown. Now in the case of a breach and someone external exposes your public key, blockchain analytic companies could go to town and start trying to uncover more information about your transaction patterns.

Another instance, more on the social engineering side, would be if your style of communication and inside jokes with colleagues were exposed via a recording you had stored externally. This could be enough information to make contact from a malicious party seem more believable.

I could go on, but I think you get my drift.

While of course I am bias in this article, the idea of secure internal video messaging can only be achieved when your videos are hosted on your own storage.
