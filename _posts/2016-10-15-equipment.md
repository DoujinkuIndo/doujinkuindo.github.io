tags:

As part of my Core Skills assessment, I am required to record and edit a short video. To do this, I can borrow equipment from [Technical Officer Mark Pickering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-pickering-95376558) (Com 121) or Media Services (Cos 102-105). Booking in advance is required to loan anything from Media Services, which can be done on the [SiSo website](https://angliamedia.siso.co/index.php).

I can borrow the following gear:
<ul>
<li>Digital camcorders</li>
<li>Digital stills cameras</li>
<li>Tripods</li>
<li>Analogue and digital audio recording equipment</li>
<li>Audio playback equipment</li>
<li>Video playback equipment</li>
<li>Data projectors</li>
</ul>
