A few days ago I was in the need to merge different pdf files into one, but unfortunately there was no easy option to do this, but after a while, it appears that you don't need a special license of any kind or the adobe acrobat professional or anything like that you need your Apple Preview. video: <a href="http://enriquemanuel.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/merging_pdf.swf">merging pdf files</a>

I will list the steps here and also will put a jing video below.
<ol>
	<li>Create a copy of the original file (just a backup), its always a good idea.</li>
	<li>Open the first pdf (the one that you want everything together in)</li>
	<li>Now open the sidebar if it isn't open yet
<ol>
	<li>Top Menu - Click View</li>
	<li>Sidebar</li>
	<li>Show Sidebar</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If you don't want to do that, you can do ( (Command key) + (Shift key) + D) - hot key</li>
	<li>Now drag the second pdf file into the first one - in the sidebar</li>
	<li>Don't drag it anywhere, this is the important part, you need to place it <strong>on top</strong> of the first file</li>
	<li>This will automatically create the second file</li>
	<li>Now save this file</li>
	<li>The file will be the same as the first one that you opened</li>
</ol>
I hope you enjoyed it and now can make multiple pdfs, as you know now, this can work with anything (image files, pdf) or whatever file Apple Preview opens.
