# Blockchain Lab - First offline event

On 14 May, The Haufe Group Network had its first offline event to explore possibilities of using distributed ledger technologies (e.g. private Blockchains) for Haufe Group products. All in all, seven product teams, including Haufe umantis, Haufe Zeugnis Manager, Haufe Discovery and Haufe Akademie, and the HRS team from CED, came forward with ideas for how they could use blockchain to improve their products.

Many of the teams manage products that are complementary to each other, which is important for this kind of event because Blockchain technology solutions are most effective when they address large scale solutions that involve many business partners and that require high-trnsaction-transparancy – for example, for an entire business network or industry.

This was one of the ideas behind having this Blockchain Lab: to bring as many Haufe Group business network players together as possible. Blockchain Lab was divided into two parts - Open talks and the Blockchain workshop.

## Defining Blockchain in our open talks
The day began with three talks from our event facilitators from Codecentric. Jannik Hüls, Alexander Sachs und Jonas Verhölen delivered three short talks that focused on what Blockchain is, how it is used for business, and how to use Hyperledger software platform to create your own private blockchain. The talks provided a definition and base understanding for Blockchain, when to use it.

The video recordings of these talks are on the [HaufeDev YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyuIumQe2DjYIuwnvCo4uA).

## Blockchain – What is it to us?
For the purpose of developing ideas for the Blockchain, we decided to break down the definition of Blockchain into three major parts –

- [Distributed ledger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledgers.asp)
- [Immutable transactions or blocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-bitcoin-block.asp)
- [Smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp)

All of these concepts can be implemented via Blockchain technology but also, separately, in other ways. To be able to “call it a blockchain”, all three of these concepts must be combined. And so the big questions we put to the product teams was: "How can your product be better"- which they supplied to us with our product idea - and "Do you need to do it with a Blockchain or is it there a better way?".

## To Blockchain or not to Blockchain...
Blockchain Lab then moved on to the second phase of the event – the Blockchain workshop. In this phase of the day, the teams with similar use cases were grouped together with the three facilitators from Codecentric to see how their product and new product feature ideas could match to blockchain.

After lunch, the Blockchain groups came together and spent the next hours developing their ideas. Most of the teams were quickly able to figure out – that their products did not require a blockchain solution for product features like audit trails for who edited letters of reference, or digital rights management for ISO standards, and so, they focussed on finding not-Blockchain solutions that better fit their needs.

## Completing the chain event
At workshop end, the teams pitched their results - presenting the new features or new products they want to develop, and if they had decided to use blockchain as a solution for solving their pain. And, in fact, at the end of the workshop – there was only one idea left standing where it potentially made sense to use Blockchain as a solution.

In retrospect, Blockchain Lab may not have spawned the next 50.000.000,00 EUR idea. But, we learned a lot about what we can and can’t do with Blockchain technology, where it might fit to our products, and how to improve these technology workshops so we can keep pushing innovation in a way that engages our colleagues and that builds up the network here at Haufe Group. Also important, is that people showed a new willingness to share their ideas, and to exchange information to explore opportunities for product innovation at Haufe Group.

Looking forward to the next event to build on the successes we had at Blockchain Lab.
