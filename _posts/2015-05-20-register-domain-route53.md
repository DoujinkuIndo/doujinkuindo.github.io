title: Register a domain with Route 53
tags: [route53]
---

[Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target="_blank"} is the AWS-service for registering and managing domains. For registering and moving domains into [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target="_blank"}, AWS hands over the requests to the registrar [Gandi](https://gandi.net){:target="_blank"}, which is located in Paris, Luxembourg, San Francisco and Taipei. The actual content of a domain is managed within Route 53, if the nameserver-entries for the domain point to specific AWS-nameservers.

To be honest, other hosters or ISPs also do that, too. However, in this blog-post I will show you, why [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target="_blank"} is not just only registering and managing domains like at any other hoster.

## Pricing

Registering a domain within [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target="_blank"} is quite affordable compared to other providers. In the USA, the registrar [GoDaddy](http://godday.com){:target="_blank"} is one of the big players. In Germany, I would chose [United Domains](http://united-domains.de){:target="_blank"}, as they - same as Route 53 - offer a big range of available TLDs. Therefore, I compared the three of them concerning their prices in USD per year for one domain and availability of TLDs.

|---
| TLD | AWS | GoDaddy | United Domains
|-|-
| .com | $12 | $13 | $17
| .net | $10 | $10 | $17
| .org | $12 | $8 | $17
| .de | $9 | $10 | $6
| .cl | $93 | $70 | $165
| .io | $39 | $59 | $110

|---
| Provider | No. of TLDs
|-|-
| AWS | 156
| GoDaddy | 352
| United Domains | 635

## Registration Process

Same as for many other tasks with AWS, the registration can be done via the [Management Console](aws.amazon.com/console/){:target="_blank"}, as well as [aws-cli](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/){:target="_blank"}. In the post, I will focus on the command line part.

First, you need to check, if the new domain is still available. This can be done with following command.

{% highlight bash %}
$ aws route53domains check-domain-availability --domain-name aws-blog.io --region us-east-1
UNAVAILABLE
{% endhighlight %}

If you get the error message **Could not connect to the endpoint URL: "https://route53domains.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/"**, it could be that your configured default region has no support for the needed services. In order to use this service, you need to set your default region to e.g. us-east-1, create a new aws-cli profile explicitly for us-east-1 or just append **--region us-east-1** to your command.

As we can see, the domain aws-blog.io as expected is already taken. So you can try for another domain and the output would look like this.

{% highlight bash %}
$ aws route53domains check-domain-availability --domain-name perhaps-this-domain-is-available.com --region us-east-1
AVAILABLE
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have found a free domain-name, we can start registering it. We first create a cli-skeleton for the parameters.

{% highlight bash %}
$ aws route53domains register-domain --generate-cli-skeleton >> registration.json
{% endhighlight %}

After the export of the sekeleton-code, we can update the parameters accordingly. When the editing is done, we can run the registration command.

{% highlight bash %}
$ aws route53domains register-domain --region us-east-1 --cli-input-json '{
>     "DomainName": "aws-is-cool.de",
>     "DurationInYears": 1,
>     "AutoRenew": false,
>     "AdminContact": {
>         "FirstName": "XXX",
>         "LastName": "XXX",
>         "ContactType": "PERSON",
>         "AddressLine1": "XXX",
>         "City": "XXX",
>         "CountryCode": "DE",
>         "ZipCode": "XXX",
>         "PhoneNumber": "+49.178000000",
>         "Email": "XXX"
>     },
>     "RegistrantContact": {
>         "FirstName": "XXX",
>         "LastName": "XXX",
>         "ContactType": "PERSON",
>         "AddressLine1": "XXX",
>         "City": "XXX",
>         "CountryCode": "DE",
>         "ZipCode": "XXX",
>         "PhoneNumber": "XXX", 
>         "Email": "XXX"
>     },
>     "TechContact": {
>         "FirstName": "XXX",
>         "LastName": "XXX",
>         "ContactType": "PERSON",
>         "AddressLine1": "XXX",
>         "City": "XXX",
>         "CountryCode": "DE",
>         "ZipCode": "XXX",
>         "PhoneNumber": "XXX",
>         "Email": "XXX"
>     },
>     "PrivacyProtectAdminContact": true,
>     "PrivacyProtectRegistrantContact": true,

{% endhighlight %}

As the return code of the command, we get an opration id. We can now check the status of our registration process, as this may take some time.

{% highlight bash %}
$ aws route53domains get-operation-detail --region us-east-1 --operation-id 24bXXX78-XXXX-4c68-XXXX-276XXXd645f1
aws-is-cool.de	24bXXX78-XXXX-4c68-XXXX-276XXXd645f1	IN_PROGRESS	1432XXXX133.5REGISTER_DOMAIN
{% endhighlight %}

After the domain had been successfully registered, the response now looks like the following.

{% highlight bash %}
$ aws route53domains get-operation-detail --region us-east-1 --operation-id 24bXXX78-XXXX-4c68-XXXX-276XXXd645f1
aws-is-cool.de	24bXXX78-XXXX-4c68-XXXX-276XXXd645f1	SUCCESSFUL	1432XXXX133.5	REGISTER_DOMAIN
{% endhighlight %}

## Management of Domains

The management of the domains within [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target="_blank"} can be done with plain [aws-cli](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/){:target="_blank"}. However, there's another cli which sits on top of aws-cli for handling [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target="_blank"} in an easier way. That cli is called [cli53](https://github.com/barnybug/cli53){:target="_blank"}. The installation can be done via [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip){:target="_blank"}.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo pip install cli53
{% endhighlight %}

With [cli53](https://github.com/barnybug/cli53){:target="_blank"} being installed, we can now create the first recordset in the hosted zone of our domain. The following command for example creates a mapping of www.aws-is-cool.de to 176.32.98.166.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cli53 rrcreate aws-is-cool.de www A 176.32.98.166 --ttl 3600
Success
ChangeInfo:
  Status: PENDING
  SubmittedAt: 2015-05-20T21:11:14.540Z
  Id: /change/C3CGXXXXX6YPT9
{% endhighlight %}

In order to delete the created recordset again, you just need to run the next command.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cli53 rrdelete aws-is-cool.de www A
Deleting www A...
Success
ChangeInfo:
  Status: PENDING

{% endhighlight %}

### Backup the DNS-config

A backup of all recordset of a domain can be very usefull, in case anything goes wrong. With [cli53](https://github.com/barnybug/cli53){:target="_blank"} you can easily export a domain in bind-format and afterwards import it again.

#### export single domain
{% highlight bash %}
$ cli53 export --full aws-is-cool.de >> aws-is-cool.de.bind
{% endhighlight %}

#### export all domains
{% highlight bash %}
$ for domain in $(cli53 list | grep Name: | awk '/ / { print $2 }' | sed s'/.$//')
do
  cli53 export --full $domain >> $domain.bind
done
{% endhighlight %}

#### import single domain
{% highlight bash %}
$ cli53 import aws-is-cool.de --file aws-is-cool.de.bind --replace --wait
{% endhighlight %}

With the above code, a less risky way of domain-import is being done. If you don't want to, you can also leave out **--replace --wait** from the command.

### Alias Entries
In order to explain the concept of alias-entries I took the following architecture.

![Route 53 Concept](/images/route53-concept.png){:class='centered'}

The steps for creating the recordsets for the concept are

1. find the ID of the Hosted Zone.
2. create entry for **tim.aws-blog.io** to **10.0.0.1**
3. create entry for **struppi.aws-blog.io** to **10.0.0.2**
4. create alias entry for **aws-blog.io** to **tim.aws-blog.io**
5. create alias entry for **staging.aws-blog.io** to **tim.aws-blog.io**
6. create alias entry for **dev.aws-blog.io** to **struppi.aws-blog.io**

Thanks to [cli53](https://github.com/barnybug/cli53){:target="_blank"}, this can be done with the following few commands.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cli53 info aws-is-cool.de
HostedZone:
  ResourceRecordSetCount: 5
  CallerReference: RISWorkflow-235edf15923f0XXXXXc26ddbeea39ee2
  Config:
    Comment: HostedZone created by Route53 Registrar
    PrivateZone: false
  Id: /hostedzone/Z3GXXXXX3UGTO
  Name: aws-is-cool.de.
DelegationSet:
  NameServers:
    - ns-806.awsdns-36.net
    - ns-500.awsdns-62.com
    - ns-1176.awsdns-19.org
    - ns-1617.awsdns-10.co.uk

$ cli53 rrcreate aws-is-cool.de tim A 10.0.0.1
$ cli53 rrcreate aws-is-cool.de struppi A 10.0.0.2
$ cli53 rrcreate aws-is-cool.de dev ALIAS 'Z3GXXXXX3UGTO struppi.aws-is-cool.de'
$ cli53 rrcreate aws-is-cool.de staging ALIAS 'Z3GXXXXX3UGTO tim.aws-is-cool.de'
$ cli53 rrcreate aws-is-cool.de '' ALIAS 'Z3GXXXXX3UGTO tim.aws-is-cool.de'
{% endhighlight %}

The nice thing of this concept is that whenever tim or struppi need to change their IP-addresse, they don't need to get changed for all referencing entries, but only for the non-alias entry.
