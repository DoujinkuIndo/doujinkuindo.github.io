* When proposing a project to be hosted by the CNCF, the goal is to show relevance, adoption and a healthy community.

* The nine members of the Technical Oversight Committee vote on whether to accept a new project.

* [The Github project board](https://github.com/cncf/toc/projects/4) lists upcoming projects. If you're interested in volunteering, check out the [CNCF SIGs](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/master/sigs).
