I discuss my journey inside CNCF, home of Kubernetes and one of the top open source foundations, some hard truths about community, and thoughts on the future of cloud native.

### Three things I learned at CNCF that changed the way I think

1. *After CNCF you could be* - set others up for future success
1. *Failure is an option* - get comfortable with trying many things and failing
1. *Treat your career like your portfolio* - diversify with new people and opportunities
