My name is Rick Medina and if y'all didn't know, I am a Tech Management major. 
This is a test so far but if it ends up working, I might update it.
Now that I got it working, I'll leave my first post.

Some few things about me:
- Batman is the hero across all mediums
- I hope the McRib is coming back soon
- There might be too many Star Wars movies coming out
Here's a picture of Jar Jar
