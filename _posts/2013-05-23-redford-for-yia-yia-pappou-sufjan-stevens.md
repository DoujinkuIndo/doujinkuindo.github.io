# Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou) — Sufjan Stevens

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=0-SKD2D6cBA Coming in at a whopping two minutes, having only two distinct instruments and repeating itself without much variation, this is an exceedingly simple song. And yet, there’s the distinct feeling of a heartstring being tugged whenever I listen to it. Why? It’s hardly even a sketch of a song – almost a sketch of a sketch. So many of Sufjan’s songs are stories, fleshed out in varying degrees of detail, and I think of this song as the most fundamental level of that spectrum – a _sentiment_. One word comes to my mind with this song: plaintive. The title adds details that one can build off of in their own minds. What happened in Redford? Who are Yia-Yia and Pappou? Nobody can certainly say what this song is _about_, perhaps not even Stevens. But with what little we’re given – the chords, the pace, the chorus of _aaahh_s – we can construct our own stories.
