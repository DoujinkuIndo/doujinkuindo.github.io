Howdy all,

I just got my Aggie Ring and I am supper exicted about that!
It is so shiny and majestic. 
Sadly, though I would have to say good by to my precious soon because it is way too big..
I was blaming my poor selection process, untill I realized that almost all friends' rings came back big as well,
This must be a production issue.
More QA needed from Assoociation of Former Students.
Oh well, I still like it and here is a picture!
