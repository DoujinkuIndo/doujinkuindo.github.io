It's over . . . it's finally over

Sixteen weeks and a couple thousand dollars later and you get this http://imgur.com/5so2YbR and a lot of questions along the lines of:

- "Who cares?"

- "What do I need to know this for?"

- "When will I actually use this?"

- "Where would this ever come in handy"

- "Why am I learning something I'll never use?"

Well the answer is 

- You should

- Basically any internet research

- You may not ever use this again but why take the chance

- See answer 2

- See answer 3

Okay well some of those answers are pretty vague but that is the beauty of it.  The research and data analysis methods covered in this course are so generic they can be applied to almost any field.

* make sense of the work youâ€™ve done this term and to demonstrate that you have thoughtfully considered how the course material may or may not be useful to you in the future
