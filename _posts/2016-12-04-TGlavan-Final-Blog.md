It's over . . . it's finally over

Sixteen weeks and a couple thousand dollars later and you get this http://imgur.com/5so2YbR and a lot of questions along the lines of:

- "Who cares?"

- "What do I need to know this for?"

- "When will I actually use this?"

- "Where would this ever come in handy"

- "Why am I learning something I'll never use?"

Well the answer is 

- You should

- Basically any research

- You may not ever use this again but why take the chance

- See answer 2

- See answer 3

Okay well some of those answers are pretty vague but that is the beauty of it.  The research and data analysis methods covered in this course are so generic they can be applied to almost any field.  In addition to this the proper formulation of a research question and then generate a coherent supporting argument. 

Obivously, these skills hold more importance for topics in humanities and soft siences but take the following as an example for the other side:

You have been tasked with improving the design of a standard internal cubustion engine with no prior experience (Topic).  First things first, you need to do some research on the matter (question).  Upon completion you will prove your abilities and display a working knowledge of the systems required for internal combustion (significance), one of the most common forms of energy production in the modern era.  You will need to design the engine that funtions properly (claim).  Provide the test results and derivation of those equations to prove that it works (reasons, evidence, and warrants). Finally you will need to provide the tolerances with whitch your engine operates and any other requirements for proper operation (alternatives).

Now this is a bit of a crude example but the connection is there and if you can connect what was learned to something as seamingly unrelated as mechanical engineering, that speaks to the flexibility of the methods.
