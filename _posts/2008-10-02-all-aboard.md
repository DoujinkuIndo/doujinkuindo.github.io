All passengers aboard now! This train is leaving the station.

Yup, some who read this will immediately have a chuckle (there is an 'in' joke above).

The news is this, I've left my good friends at Dolphin Technology Group and moved to a smaller firm on the south-side of Brisbane.

Why the move? Well after spending nearly two and a half years supporting MYOB AE, HandiSoft and a bunch of other Accounting Industry products up and down the eastern coast, I got tired of the traveling and being away from home. The new job has no travel. So I guess the 'train' I've just caught isn't leaving the station after all. Perhaps I'm really standing on the platform, waving goodbye to those still on the train?

Who is the new firm?
[Evolution Marketing - who specialise in ACT! and Sage CRM](http://evolutionmarketing.com.au/).

Yesterday was my first day - after the induction it was straight into 'sponge' mode. Training began. More today. And tomorrow. Yippie. This is fun ;-).
