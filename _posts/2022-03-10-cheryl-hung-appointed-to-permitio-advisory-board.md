I'm delighted to join the advisory board of [Permit.io](https://www.permit.io/), a Tel Aviv-based startup which empowers developers to bake in permissions and access-control into any product in minutes.

Other advisors and angel investors include Amir Jerbi, CTO and Co-Founder of Aqua Security; Danny Grander, Co-Founder of Snyk; Idan Tendler, CEO & Co-Founder of Bridgecrew; John Kodumal, CTO & Co-Founder of LaunchDarkly; Nitzan Shapira, CEO & Co-Founder of Epsagon.

What attracted me about Permit.io is their support of open source, particularly [OPAL](https://www.opal.ac/) which builds upon the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) project. Or and the team are highly engaged with the community, and I look forward to deeper collaborations together!
