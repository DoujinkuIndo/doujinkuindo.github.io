If you want to watch a post-apocalypse movie focused about the three fundamentals laws of robotic it is a good choice to watch...

It movie takes place in a near future and treat about the philosophical question of: Do all humans deserve to live?... and if nature laws don't keep the balance, can intelligent machines do it instead?

If you don't understand the final just write me and I tell you what I think that happens and why I love this movie so much!
