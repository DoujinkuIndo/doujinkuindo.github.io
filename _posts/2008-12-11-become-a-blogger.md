Yes - I signed up to Becomeablogger.com - after
[reading the free road map PDF](http://www.becomeablogger.com/go.php?offer=benham&pid=3&u=http://www.becomeablogger.com/roadmap) and
[watching the 10 free Howto videos](http://www.becomeablogger.com/go.php?offer=benham&pid=3&u=http://www.becomeablogger.com/).

Even tho I've been blogging since 2002, in the last 24 hours I've already learnt stuff. Plus I've got access to a private forum (ie no trolls) where like minded 'students' and experts like Yaro and Gideon answer questions.

What it means for my readers is improved quality from here on in.
