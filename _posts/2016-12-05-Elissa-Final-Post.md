This blog post like most of my finals comes to you in three parts for the last time.

## Part 1: We learned things???

Yes, we did. 

We learned the four main components to a good research. 

    A specific enough: Topic,
                    Question,
                    Significance,
                    and sometimes Application.
                     
We learned the five main components of an argument.
 
    Claim:            What is my claim?
    Reason:           What reasons support my claim?
    Evidence:         What evidence supports mt reasons?
    Alternative:      Do I acknowledge alternative/objections/complications and how do I respond?
    Warrant:          What prinicple/warrent justifies connecting your reasoning to your claim?
    
We learned the basics of a social network, and then some.

  Nodes, Edges, Networks, Dyads, Triads, Homophily, Reciprocity, Propinquity, Edgelist, Matrix, Ego-Centric, Socio-centric, Open Network, Directed and Indirected Relationships, Degree Centraliy, Betweenness Centrality, Eugenvector Centrality, and Structural Equivalent.

## Part 2: We applied things we learned???

Yes, we did.

We used the components of a good research question and an argument to disect many papers and articles. We used social networks to analyize episodes of Once Upon of Time, and Supergirl. As well as applying all of these for the research project.

## Part 3: 

I enjoyed what I learned through this blog. It opened my eyes to the complexity of humanities as a subject more so than any other class that I have taken. I especially enjoyed learnign about social networks. It was a completely new topic for me as well as NodelXL, and it is definitly something that I want to continue learning about. I hope to use what I have learned here in not only future humanities classes, but for other research projects in my future as an engineer.
