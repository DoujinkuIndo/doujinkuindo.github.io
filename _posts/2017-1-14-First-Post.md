Just switching from WordPress to Jekyell and GitHub pages. I hope this will be a promising move encourging me to write a little bit more.

I followed the simple instructions on [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) and then I will need to put some custom theme.
