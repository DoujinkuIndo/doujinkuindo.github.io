title: DevConfCZ 2016

Whoah, [this conference](http://devconf.cz) just keeps getting **bigger** and better.
The organizers counted about 1200 people just **in the first day**.
I remember attending about 5-6 years ago, there were about 120 people in total.
Also, check out my post from [last year's DevConfCZ]({{site.url}}/DevConfCZ).

Just check out the [#DevConfCZ](https://twitter.com/hashtag/devconfcz?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash)
Twitter hashtag for proof. Also, the coffee from [Kofi Kofi](http://kofikofi.cz/) was just amazing.

Several *minor* problems occured to me during the weekend:

* Lack of recycling trash bins
* 8 parallel sessions, anyone? -- during some time slots, I've definitely been in need of [Hermione's time turning thing](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner).
How can you attend 3 talks at the same time? (Answer: YouTube live stream + archive!)

Here's a short summary of talks I attended. Most of them you can find in
