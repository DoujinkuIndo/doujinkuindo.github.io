Ok, this is a quick and simple update. Trying to learn Markdown Language. I'm used to HTML, which is a markup language, so in theory, this should be simpler. Seems that it is not. HTML is way easier. Have to keep at it. Will try to post here as much as I can- that is the only way that I am going to learn this.
