# Time Dilation and GPS Satellites

The term _mathematics_ is often accompanied by the derogatory epithet _pure_; indicating that the subject has little to no real-world application, and is therefore of no value to society. It is true that many mathematical fields are without application; I would merely add _yet._ Many times throughout history has an isolated and insular field seen invaluable, if delayed, employment. A good example is [George Boole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)'s work (circa 1850) on a field of algebraic logic now known as _[boolean algebra_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra), which saw massive application over a hundred years later in the form of _digital [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate)_, the AND, OR, and NOTs that are so employed by modern computer circuits, transistors, and diodes. This can be a very valuable perspective to maintain; one of the features of the massive parallel engine that is the modern academic world is that it is so encapsulated; workers sometimes do not see the fruits of their labor within their lifetime; they are considered lucky to receive recognition. The most famous recipient of this recognition was Albert Einstein, whose 1905 work on [special relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) introduced a highly counterintuitive concept known as [time dilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation); as expressed in his _Principle of Invariant Light Speed, _

> light is always propagated in empty space with a definite <del>velocity</del> [speed] _c_ which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.

Relativity exists in two forms: general and special, the former operating on macroscopic scales; the latter, microscopic. By 1916, physicists were able to predict two effects of _time dilation:_

  * one, that a reference frame with sufficient velocity will experience a slower rate of time relative to an inertial reference frame, and;
  * two, that a reference frame with sufficiently low gravitational potential will experience a similarly slowed rate of time relative to an inertial reference frame.
At the time, this work was, of course, internationally recognized and acclaimed; Einstein became a celebrity even to the layperson; however, this fame was due to partially to the [mass-energy equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence) and partially to his work on the atomic bomb and its political implications. Time dilation, needless to say, did not breach the public sphere. Around forty years later, in 1956, [Friedwardt Winterberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedwardt_Winterberg) proposed a real-world text of relativity which involved the placement of highly accurate [atomic clocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock) on very fast, very high-altitude satellites; this would have the effect of readily testing both effects of time dilation. This idea was kicked around the defense-contractor circuit for about ten years, and eventually resulted in [TRANSIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_\(satellite\)), in 1964, an early satellite navigation system.

(An aside: GPS and other satellite navigation systems operate on a sort of three-dimensional [triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation); this involves sending up signals to all nearby satellites, which ping back the time and location of the signal's reception; this defines a sphere (see: [trilateration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration)) around the GPS unit, which can calculate its own location using a set of [surprisingly simple equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Navigation_equations).) However, without compensation for the time-dilation effects experienced as such high velocity (and such high relative gravitational potential), GPS errors would [accumulate by around 10km a day](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html). Thus, all GPS systems are programmed with time-dilation compensation algorithms built-in, using the [Lorentz transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor), which really isn't so bad after all. Now imagine momentarily an alternate historical timeline, in which we sent up GPS satellites, uninspired by Winterberg's predictions; merely to measure location. After all, the technology involved in building the satellites doesn't involve relativity at all; merely strong engineering principles, rocket science, propulsion, and other comparatively intuitive sciences. Imagine that we used the same triangulation methods and discovered a 38 microsecond drift per day! There would have been absolutely no way of explaining it, until astrophysics arrived at the explanation on its own. To reiterate: often, pure mathematics (and, by extension, Physics, the most virginal of the sciences) will involve a field with no obvious applications. I take it on a mixture of gambler's fallacy and faith that, because there are so many examples of previously unapplied mathematics finding vital applications decades later, all mathematics _must_ have some application; it had merely not been discovered yet.
