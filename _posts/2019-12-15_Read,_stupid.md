I'm technician (even not engineer actually). Just one of thousands of tribes in huge worldwide outsourcing company.  
I feel that recently gone in wrong direction. A bit overloaded, I’m middle of average "career"[1] I start to get less than in past from mine reading. 
Yes, I still mostly I read for fun. Novel / fiction / fan fiction. Many of technical manual. 
Some business books. Somehow to better collaborate with others (sometimes called managerial/leadership path). It's also essential technician responsibility. 

So, what is mine recent interesting findings: 
- [Mastering Collaboration](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-collaboration/9781492041726/)
- [Managing your manager](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/managing-your-manager/0636920313472/) not reading, interactive training on Safari Books online 
- very promising followup of "The Phoenix Project"  By Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford, called:  ["The Unicorn Project](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QT9QR41): A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data" by 
Gene Kim 

Soon - I hope I will share mine impresion of that. :) 

[1] I start work as helpdesk and sysadmin in 1996, 23 years ago. It was quite confusing when on one of our internal training, dedicated to preparing RHCA exam I declare – ok, it’s time to formalize mine skillset in that area, as I install first RedHat over 22 years ago. And colleague on mine right comment – “I was 3 years old then”. But all mine history I rather used (and consider myself)  to be a Soft’ie guy – you know: Windows, Exchange, IIS, SQL Server, SharePoint, System Center Operations Manager).
