title: A basic overview of mixing using DAW software.
---

This post is literally a piece of coursework. The brief tells me to make "A blog with illustrative examples of mixing and mastering using a DAW." So here I am!

This blog won't cover DAW basics, such as adjusting levels, automation etc but is more geared towards using slightly more involved elements of mixing.

The reference track used in all of these clips is Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now". The stems are available online if you want to try them yourself!

N.B - To add plugins in Audition, just go to your effects rack, hit track effects and add plugins of your choice!

N.B but twice - I applied a hard limiter to the master, which I'll talk about later on, to stop your ears from being destroyed by clipping on the bad examples.

## Parametric EQ

Parametric EQ is essentially what allows me to edit the tonal properties of the audio track. If you use Logic, like I do on my Mac, all of the EQ plugins are parametric anyway, but parametric essentially just means that it has a graph that you can adjust the parameters on to change the sound of the audio. I'm going to use it on my kickdrum stem to add more punch to the sound.
When used too much, it sounds like this:

When used correctly, it can add warmth and punch:

## Noise Gate

A noise gate is a really easy way to prevent any noise that isn't the subject from playing on a recording, as it only lets audio that hits a threshold (in dB) through its filter. Of course, the ideal situation would be that you record in a properly treated studio, but even then there can be some noises like sound bleed that can occur that may sneak their way into your recording.
However, if you misuse a noise filter, it can lead to pretty disastrous effect:

On the other hand, used correctly, it can help reduce noise pretty well:


## Compressors

Compressors are best represented by this picture of a cat:
![White cat in a square, transparent box with the word Compression over the top in white text.](https://toaster.sh/i/jwn2.png)
In essence, they squish your audio down and make it all sound the same level overall when played back. This is useful if artists sing quietly at some points but still want emphasis on vocals. A good example of this is Billie Eilish's Therefore I Am, at the "Stop. What the hell are you talking about?" line.
In the case of Don't Stop Me Now, though, Freddie's vocals are already compressed, so there's not much I can do to them.

## Master Bus Compression

Master bus compression is the same thing as compression, but instead of only being applied to a single track, it is applied to the whole master bus. Crazy, right? I chose to use a multiband compressor. When used correctly, it not only evens levels, but also adds warmth.

This is how I ended up using master bus compression:

I then recorded another take with a "broadcast" preset on. You'll notice that everything is overly squashed, and the highs are very tinny.
