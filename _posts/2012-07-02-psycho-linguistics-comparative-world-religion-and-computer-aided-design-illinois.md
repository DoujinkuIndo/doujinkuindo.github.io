# Psycho-linguistics, Comparative World Religion, and Computer-Aided Design: Illinois

Signed up for classes at Illinois today. Began with ENG 100, which becomes ENG 198 (an IEFX course) after four weeks. That's basic engineering seminar stuff, and then, later, large-scale team-based engineering projects. Seriously exciting. Math 221, Calculus I, was next. I've taken this course... twice already, but done badly in the Calc II section of it. Maybe I ought to start there? I'll look into it. It may turn out to be excellent review, and it may turn out to be disgustingly repetitive. My AP Chem score (4) means I can skip Chemistry (excellent!), and my AP CS score (predicted) means I can skip right to CS 125 (if it opens in August). My ACT score means I can skip RHET and go right to ME 120, Computer-Aided Design. CAD classes are incredibly exciting stuff, an intersection of my favorite things. Hopefully it'll be a super nice computer lab and a great way to wake up. Then the fun stuff. Two humanities courses: (getting them out of the way early) Psycho-linguistics (think Noam Chomsky) and Comparative World Religion. Hot Christ on a Bike, I'm excited. Psycho-linguistics is the study of how language forms and develops in the brain, and Comparative World Religion is (if handled tactfully) perhaps the most interesting part of history. Spent a number of hours perfecting this schedule. Sleep in late Monday mornings; forced to wake up at 8 TWRF in order to get big blank periods to work in; get out early Friday evenings. Good for trips up to Chicago, home to NYC, etc. Lots of time for studying. Very very exciting. Overall, I think I didn't throw myself in too deep. I can save Physics, CS 125, Calc II, Astrophysics, etc. for second semester, if I feel unchallenged. But I don't think I will. Here I go.
