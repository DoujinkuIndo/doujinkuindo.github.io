I am a huge fan and user of <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>. What fascinates me about the website is that there is someone for every visual pallet. It doesn’t matter if you are like me and like to visit tech and gaming “subreddits” (the separate sub-communities of Reddit) like <a href="http://reddit.com/r/technology">/r/technology</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a>, or if you like to visit the popular cute animals and babies in <a href="http://reddit.com/r/aww">/r/aww</a> or typically stunning photographs of <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pics">/r/pics</a>. There is literally something for everyone. There are also a plethora of much darker and adult themed subreddits, but that is something best left undiscussed for now.<br><br>Perusing the website the other day I stubbled across <a href="http://reddit.com/r/iphone">/r/iPhone</a>. Being an iPhone fan–I stood in line on release day for my iPhone 5s–I clicked through the links to see if anything of interest caught my eye. That’s when I first laid eyes on Spool Dock by Quell&Co.<br>

Spool Dock is a project on Kickstarter and is what I consider “the perfect dock for iPhone and iPad mini.” Not only does it dock either device, it also has built in cable management. The dock is made up of two primary parts that allow for your Apple Lightning cable to wind itself around the core of the dock–similar to a spool of thread.<br><br>

<br>Spool Dock also looks great. It has a modern look, without being made out of a chunk of aluminum, and yet maintains a classy, elegant look as well. The spool design is simple and something that surprisingly hasn’t been done yet. It’s comprised of three main materials: hardwoods, 100% Merino wool felt and a durable powder-coated metal base. It is as gorgeous as it is practical.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Spool Dock Kickstarter ended yesterday and came nowhere close meeting its goal of $85,000. In an email to Spool Dock’s backers, Quell&Co. said they still had great interest in their dock and that they were “pursuing a few different paths to bring both the Spool Dock and Quell&Co. to life.” Be check back in here or check out <a href="http://quellandco.com/">QuellandCo.com</a> for updates on the future of Spool Dock.
