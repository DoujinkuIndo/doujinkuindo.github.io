I've been pretty bored this month, and have also decided to take a break from some of my gaming. So I've been watching the tv series Stargate: SG-1 on Netflix. Pretty good, I think. It's surprising that it's over ten years old (from 1997). I keep wondering to myself why the cars are so oldâ€¦ It's even weirder when I realize a lot of the kids in the show are my age.

I'm kind of lazy, so here are some interesting tidbits from Wikipedia:

> ## Series Overview
>
> Stargate SG-1 resumes the plot of the original feature film and follows the present-day adventures of SG-1, a military team from Earth. SG-1 and two dozen other SG teams venture to distant planets using a fictional alien portal known as a Stargate, which in the series is housed in a top-secret United States Air Force military base known as Stargate Command (SGC) underneath Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In the first eight seasons, the mission of the SG teams is to explore the galaxy and search for alien technology and allies to defend Earth against the Goa'uld, a snake-like parasitic alien race that takes humans as unwilling hosts. As explained in the series' backstory, the Goa'uld transported human slaves from Earth to other habitable planets across the galaxy thousands of years ago and now pose as gods of Ancient Earth mythologies, particularly Egyptian mythology. SG-1 eventually learns that highly evolved but now impassive human-like beings, known as the Ancients, had originally built the Stargate network millions of years earlier, before they used their extraordinary powers to Ascend to a higher plane of existence. The fictional Ori, who belong to the same race as the Ancients but preach religious fundamentalism, assume the role of the main antagonists in seasons 9 and 10.

> ## Collaboration with the military
>
> The United States Air Force (USAF) cooperated closely with the Stargate SG-1 producers. Before the beginning of the series, the USAF granted production access to the Cheyenne Mountain complex to film stock shots. They also read every script for mistakes and provided help with plausible background stories for all characters, ribbons, uniform regulations, hair advice, plotlines, and military relationships. The USAF flew up several T-38 Talon, F-15 and F-16 fighter jets to Vancouver for various episodes and direct-to-DVD films. Many of the extras portraying USAF personnel were real USAF personnel.

Until next time
