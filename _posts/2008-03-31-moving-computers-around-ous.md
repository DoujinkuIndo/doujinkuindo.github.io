I've had this snippet hanging around as a draft for some time, here it is.

Moving comptuers around OUs (Organisational Units) can be a pain if you can't find the computer you want.<!--more-->

To find a wayward computer open up
- **Active Directory**
- right click on your
- **local domain name**
- select
- **find**
- change the scope to
- **show computers**
- type in the name you are looking for and bingo, you've found it.

From here you can right click the computer name and move it to the OU you want it in.
