# So Serious — Electric Light Orchestra

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_83KIChT_FU 2010, Upper West Side of Manhattan, winter months, January or February, maybe, a few days after the first of the month; 7pm, maybe, but the sun's already set, walking west from Central Park West and 79th street when the weather is good enough (read: not hailing) to try and take the 1 home. It's cold and my new glasses are fogging; I have tiny earbuds, but the walk feels infinite. I've been doing some kind of astro work — depending on the year, it's either abysmally easy or incredibly hard — and my brain is full of mush, and I let my body take over, trudging through the snow, usually, three, four days a week, trying to get home and fudge through my homework, full of sentimentality about _the universe_ in general, full of thoughts of star formation or maybe train delays. This song is stuck to that time — there can be no reason.
