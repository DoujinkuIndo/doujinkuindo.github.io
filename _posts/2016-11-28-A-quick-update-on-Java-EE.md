title: A quick update on Java EE
---

Oracle is notifying the Java Community that it will withdraw the JSRs for Management 2.0 (JSR 373), and JMS 2.1 (JSR 368). <!--more-->In response to community feedback, Oracle is investigating a possible transfer of MVC to another community member or organization in order to complete JSR 371 as a stand-alone component.

These changes are consistent with the revised Java EE roadmap presented at JavaOne 2016, in which Oracle proposed to remove these JSRs from Java EE 8.  For more details, see Anil Gaur’s portion of the [JavaOne 2016 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqfjW-RQPOs) and Linda DeMichiel’s [Java EE 8 Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th9faGLhQoM) presentation.  The changes also reflect the importance ranking of these technologies in Oracle's follow-up Java EE community survey.  Management, JMS, and MVC were ranked at or near the bottom of all technologies which were surveyed.  We expect to have an update soon describing the overall survey results and next steps for Java EE 8.
