## Homework
1. Review
    - MDN: [Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)
        - [`srcset` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-srcset)
        - [`sizes` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-sizes)
2. File prep
    - Small, medium and large sample images.
    - Sample Hero section or other page segment that uses a large image on Desktop and smaller on mobile.
    - Sample blog page with multiple images that you need to scroll through.
3. `srcset`
    - Read: [Responsive Images: If you’re just changing resolutions, use `srcset`](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/)
    - Watch: [Figuring Out Responsive Images](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/133-figuring-responsive-images/)
    - Read: [Don’t use `<picture>` (most of the time)](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/)
4. Native lazy loading images
    - Read: [`loading` image attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading#Images_and_iframes) by MDN
    - Read: [Native Lazy Loading](https://css-tricks.com/native-lazy-loading/) by CSS Tricks
    - Watch: [Lazy loading is too easy now](https://youtu.be/AActXSWxsRo) by Kevin Powell
