title: The Trinity in the Bible

One of the central doctrines common to almost all modern denominations of Christianity is that of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity). The Trinity is the idea that God exists in three persons, yet is still one. [However, nowhere in the Bible does the word "Trinity" appear](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=trinity&qs_version=NABRE). Does that mean - assuming the Bible is correct - that this doctrine is wrong? Perhaps, [but the Bible doesn't mention zebras](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=zebra&qs_version=NABRE), either, and they most certainly exist.

There is evidence of the Trinity in the Bible, however. Take the Gospel of [John 14:6-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A6-11&version=NABRE):

> <sup>6</sup>Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. <sup>7</sup>If you know me, then you will also know my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him." <sup>8</sup>Philip said to him, "Master, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us." <sup>9</sup>Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you for so long a time and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? <sup>10</sup>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own. The Father who dwells in me is doing his works. <sup>11</sup>Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else, believe because of the works themselves."

Here, Jesus doesn't use any of the words now used to explain the Trinity - namely, [hypostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostasis_%28philosophy_and_religion%29) and [consubstantial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consubstantiality). He also only mentions two persons of the Trinity - [God the Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_the_Father) and [God the Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_the_Son) - and leaves out the third - [God the Holy Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit_%28Christianity%29).

I don't think - although I certainly could be wrong - that Jesus is trying to lay out the entire Trinitarian formula here. He's just explaining that he is "consubstantial" with God the Father - that God the Father is in God the Son, and that God the Son is in God the Father.
