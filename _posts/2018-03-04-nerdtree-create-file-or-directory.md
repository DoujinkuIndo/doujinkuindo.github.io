title: Creating a new file or directory using NERDTree
---

I've been happily using `vim`/`neovim` for a while but today I discovered a feature I think is worth sharing since, AFAIK, this is not widely known even among intermediate users. If you're using the add-on `NERDTree` you can easily create and rename files and directories without having to quit the editor or having to move to a different `tmux` pane.

To do so, you need to open `NERDTree` ― by default this can be done using the shortcut `Ctrl+t` ― and navigate to the destination folder or file. Then press `m` to open the NERDTree filesystem menu. From there you have five different options:

The options are self-explanatory, so I won't waste time describing them. I hope this could turn useful to someone. It certainly made my "developer" day :-)
