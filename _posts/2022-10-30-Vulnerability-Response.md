# Well... it happened... again...
\<Insert Beercules meme from How I Met your Mother>

Only 3 things in life are guaranteed:
- Death
- Taxes
- A new critical vuln with a cool name will ruin your weekend at least once a year

Incident Response plans for "we got hacked", and "there was an earthquake" are fairly common, but I've yet to find a general guide for "how to handle the hot new vuln impacting 99% of my infra". This post aims to be that guide, and points out the common pitfalls I've encountered along the way.

## Phase 0: Vulnerability Announced
Marketing teams and attorneys tend to over-use the phrase "zero day"... so I'll avoid it here. When a new high profile/critical vulnerability is announced, I start by asking the following questions:
- What software/OS versions are impacted?
- Is there a specific config that must exist for the exploit to work?
- Is this "just a DoS for now"?

The first two make sense... they inform my follow-up questions of:
- How do I find all the matching systems, and their owners?
- How do I verify a host/application is at risk?

But, the last one is important when it comes to "playing the long game". If I don't work at a company with a hard requirement for 99.999 uptime, or if my company doesn't have a history of people attempting to DoS us.... it means my team shouldn't be losing sleep over patching/chasing down the issue. One thing to keep in mind is, "this vulnerability existed yesterday, we just didn't know about it."

With those 3 questions answered, it's time to tighten up my processes. We really need X things:
- A way to detect if something is at risk
- A way to kickoff and track efforts to fix it
- A way to report our progress to the rest of the company


## Detect if something is at risk

Don't worry, your CISO's inbox is likely full of vendor emails offering to help you solve the new "ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY!!!". You'll find a tool to do the actual detection. That said, keep the following questions in mind when selecting one:

- How does the detection work?
The most basic checks are often "does this filename exist on the host", or "run this command to get your software version". These types of checks aren't great, because engineers love pointing out edge cases...
   - "The file exists, but we don't use it... x            "
   - "Th"

- How often does the scan run?
- What metadata does the tool provide to aid in tracking/deduplication?


- How do we know we aren't closing things that aren't really closed
- How do we not create 500 tickets for 5 things
