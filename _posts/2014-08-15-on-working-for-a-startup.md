## On Leasemaid

This summer, shortly after graduating from Dev Bootcamp, I was invited by a friend of mine to join him and his nascent startup in Harbor Springs Michigan. It was definitely an interesting opportunity that really sprung up on me, but i thought to myself, 'why not?'. I figured I would get myself some more coding experience before I started job hunting and looking for somewhere I could be mentored and guided into learning the finer points of coding. 

Immediately as i got here we began a 2 week coding sprint so that we could push out an alpha version of our application for a small client. I quickly learned that there would be no mentor and that I would not only need to do my share of the work, I would have to help out in areas that might even feel like a chore. 

I rapidly needed to start learning different skills and technologies and then immediately apply them to the project. Some of them worked quite well, and others did not. This was interesting. I was learning by being thrown off the deep end. I was making things happen and i felt both responsible and motivated by my work. I felt, and continue to feel, motivated to create these things. I was learning to use github methodically, I was learning to ask the right questions when understanding code that i had no familiarity with. I was learning to figure out the solution myself instead of looking to someone for help. I felt stuck many times and didn't know how to solve the damn bug. I learned to circumvent the issue, to try new ways when i simply cannot get past a particularly sticky point.

As we deployed the first time, I learned the importance of testing almost immediately. I would find myself just hoping that the new code I was adding would not break other parts of the code, and yet realizing how insecure this made me feel about our code. And though, I entirely see the power of testing and that absolute need for it, I still have not had the time to thoroughly learn it and employ it in our code. Because, at the same time i understood the relationship between development and the startup world. I understand that I have to be able to pitch a product that I investors find appealing, at the moment, and there is not enough manpower to invest into testing just yet. But, it is unanimous between us that as soon as we get funding we must create solid tests and then refactor the fuck out of our code. But for now we must build to implement the ideas that will hopefully get us funding. 

I am learning quite a bit.
