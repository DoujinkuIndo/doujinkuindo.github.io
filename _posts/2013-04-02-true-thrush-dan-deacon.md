# True Thrush — Dan Deacon

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=k0_AEJnpWzA My mind seems to be wired such that most songs have a kinetic element that manifests in my mind when I listen to them. Heavily and intricately textured ones, like True Thrush, are a particularly vivid experience; Deacon's half-synthetic loops overlap and coalesce, interweaving like dense underbrush (I always think of a jungle when I listen to this song). It's one of those songs that feel very genuinely like an _adventure_: like it's pulling you through a tunnel made of shimmering synths and distortions before thrusting you into a vast, open chorus ("spread those wings wide and take me along" are about as fitting as lyrics get). Whistles and wobbling layers almost mimic the sounds of wildlife, as if the whole song were some blithe electro-safari. And above all, there's a palpitating sense to the whole thing: a dependable in-and-out that for five minutes seems to restore a reasonable rhythm to lifestyles whose paces often seem beyond our control. It's therapeutic without taking itself to seriously, and that's what pulls me to it again and again.
