We had a great speaker from OpsCruise joining our May Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), and [ControlPlane](https://control-plane.io/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Aloke Guha from OpsCruise gave us a talk on Next Gen Observability using Open Source Monitoring (starting at [18:16](https://youtu.be/Nl2YK8sA2u8?t=1096)). His takeaways mentioned: 

* Modern cloud native applications running in Kubernetes creates some vexing challenges in production
* We can leverage open-source and CNCF monitoring such Open Telemetry effectively to extract deep insights into your application
* Using contextual knowledge and AI/Ops can enable proactive detection, isolation and resolution of problems - reducing Ops manual efforts and MTTR

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
