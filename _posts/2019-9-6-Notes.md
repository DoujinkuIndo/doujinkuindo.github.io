- There, in this mind that is breathing right now,  
  There lies Enlightenment. Nowhere else.  
  Nothing is missing. [Nothing is lost. Nothing is found.](/pages/study/zen/coin-lost-river)  
  There is no illusion, and no attainment.

- About _Wu_ (_Mu_): I like to think it's the answer of the dog. If you asked a dog, "Does a dog have Buddha nature or not?", you'd get a well rounded _Wu(f)_ : "What do you think?"

- After a first investigation of Gateless Gate Case #1 (Chao-Chou's dog or "Mu"), I wanted to restart my readongs of Chan/Zen more or less _in order_, to understand the evolution of their Dharma. BodhiDharma, Huang-Po, Hui-neng. I wanted to understand the Zen understanding of Buddha Nature. I hope to be able to compile the notes and quotes here. I switched to Gateless Gate Case #2.
