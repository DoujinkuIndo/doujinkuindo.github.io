:   Let us pause in life&#8217;s pleasures and count its many tears,
:   While we all sup sorrow with the poor;
:   There&#8217;s a song that will linger forever in our ears;
:   Oh Hard times come again no more.
:   _Chorus:_</p> 
    
    :   Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
    :   Hard Times, hard times, come again no more
    :   Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
    :   Oh hard times come again no more.
:   While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
:   There are frail forms fainting at the door;
:   Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
:   Oh hard times come again no more.
:   _(Chorus)_
:   There&#8217;s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away,
:   With a worn heart whose better days are o&#8217;er:
:   Though her voice would be merry, &#8217;tis sighing all the day,
:   Oh hard times come again no more.
:   _(Chorus)_
:   Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,
:   Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
:   Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave
:   Oh hard times come again no more.
:   _(Chorus)_

사순절이 한참이다. 이따금 크리스찬이라는 정체성이 무엇을 요구하는 가에 대해서 생각하게 된다. 

&#8220;삶의 즐거움을 잠시 멈추고 삶의 많은 눈물을 세어 보세나.
    
우리 모두, 가난한 이들과 더불어 슬픔을 맛보며.&#8221;
