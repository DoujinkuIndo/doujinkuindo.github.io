I first heard the quote "only the paranoid survive" about 1999 or 2000. But it's only recently I've heard the full quote. Which is:>Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.

This thinking applies to so many things, but one I often apply it to is backups. Yes the humble yet oft forgotten backup.

Just because everything is working, and going along swimmingly, we become complacent, we forget or put off doing a backup of our files, our photographs etc.  This is when we most need to do our backup, so that when a problem arises, we have that backup to go to.

Thus (and this is the question that prompted me writing this) is "what do I use to backup?".

I use both
[Dropbox](https://db.tt/Banmhm2) and
[Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com/partner/af6883). You may think they both serve the same purpose. They don't.

I use
[Dropbox](https://db.tt/Banmhm2) to make files available to myself across all the platforms I use, and I use it to share files and folders with others. In a sense it backs up my data, but that's not what it's there for.

To backup my data, workfiles, photos, music and emails I use
[Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com/partner/af6883). Backblaze quietly sits in the background and backs up everything. Those files don't have to be in my Dropbox folder to be backed up. It's the easiest, cheapest and most effective offsite backup solution you can implement.

If you aren't paranoid about losing your files, you don't need to do anything. If you are, and I am, you need to start backing up. You've got no excuses. Complain to me and it'll fall on deaf ears.
