I'M BAAACK!

So it time to start getting into the meat and really start exploring what this blog is going to cover.

First things first, we must figure out how to define digital humanities research.  Breaking this down into thrre words may be a bit cliche but its probably best to start from the bottom and work our way up from there.

So after a quick look at webster the definitions we get are as follows:

Digital - " of or relating to information that is stored in the form of the numbers 0 and 1"

Humanities - "the branches of learning (as philosophy, arts, or languages) that investigate human constructs and concerns as opposed to natural processes (as in physics or chemistry) and social relations (as in anthropology or economics)"

Research - " careful study that is done to find and report new knowledge about something"
