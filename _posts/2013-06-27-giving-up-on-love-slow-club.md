# Giving Up On Love-- Slow Club

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huJKfY7O6Es This is a good morning anthem.  A song for waking up naked and alone and being pretty psyched about it.  A song that will cause you to get distracted from getting ready for your day because you just must dance.  Something that adds a bounce to your step on the first day of spring.  A song that could easily begin a new personal era, be it for an two hours or two months.  (Though probably not two years?  This song might be a little much for two years.)  It’s not an ambiguous happy song.  Depending on your mood and opinion on romantic love, the lyrics can be rejuvenating, or freeing, or aggressively indifferent, or even part-sad.  Whatever you feel about the words, it is hard not to see this song as at very least cause to boogie down.
