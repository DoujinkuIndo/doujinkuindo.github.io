I'm not going to lie - my resume is impressive for a twenty-two year old. 

I've been designing and building digital products for the past seven years, and in that time have had the opportunity to work with a variety of teams in several different roles, and with a lot of different technologies. I know a little bit about a lot of things. 

My curiosity and generalist/full-stack/unicorn approach to my career has been vastly rewarding, and I'm grateful every single day for the opportunities I've been presented. I've worked hard to get where I am, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon.

All of this brings me to the main focus of this post - recruiters.

## Stop Spamming my Inbox

I get contacted by recruiters **constantly**. This morning alone, my LinkedIn inbox had four messages about "exciting new career opportunities", and five vanilla connection requests (no info, just the standard "Add me to your network") from folks I've never even heard of. Every single one of them was a recruiter.

Its difficult to complain about recruiters because I have my current job because of one. My recruiter worked very hard to get me the position I have now, and it was a much better fit than my last contract. That being said, it still wasn't the greatest experience.

The moment my last contract ended, the recruiters came knocking in droves. Hell, they didn't even wait that long. I figured I'd be polite and follow up with a couple of them - #mistake. Not long after I'd responded to just a handful of my suitors, I was sitting through interviews and being offered contracts from several different companies in the area. Again, its hard to complain - especially given the current state of the economy. But when I wasn't ready to pull the trigger on any of the contracts I was offered - keep in mind that I still hadn't really got to enjoy any downtime between contracts, which had been the plan all along - I was being strong-armed by several recruiters at once - all of whom wanted me to make them money. It was unbelievably stressful.

## I am NOT a Commodity

I understand what your job is. I really do! But just because the bottom-line sees me as a commodity to be passed around to different local business, doesn't mean that I deserve to be treated as one. I've worked hard to get where I'm at, and so excuse me if I'm going to be a little choosy about where I spend the next .X-years of my life. 

My last (and only) contract position did not go so well. It was not a good culture fit, I was given constant praise and no constructive feedback. I also have yet to hear from the recruitment agency about my "next contract" half a year later. 

Again, I understand how your industry works - and I'm grateful that it exists. But until you learn to treat the tech workers that you place just like you do your "clients", you will not be getting a kind response from me. 

## So Please Please Please

* Stop spamming my inbox. 
	* If I don't know you, and I haven't reached out to you - I don't want to talk to you. I'm happily employed and that's not gonna change anytime soon.
* Stop fluffing. 
	* Every single company is doing something "cool" or "growing at an exciting rate". I'm not some idiot who's going to fall in love with some shitty buzzwords anymore.
* Be honest about your contracts. 
	* Don't tell me you think I'd be a good culture fit if I absolutely will not be. Don't say that I'll be doing one thing and then have me doing something completely different come Day 1.
* Stop trying to poach employees. 
	* I read somewhere that recruiters hardly reach out to the unemployed. WTF. If I'm employed and want to leave, I'll let you know. Otherwise spend your time chatting with someone who actually wants a new job or contract.
    
## TL;DR
- recruiters, please leave me alone unless you have freelance work for me. Seriously.
