    So I&#8217;ve picked up some German&#8230;
  </div>

A few cool things have happened since I last checked in with you all&#8230; went on a [canal cruise](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0727.jpg) through Amsterdam and saw a lot of things that seemed cool at the time &#8211; like the [7 bridges](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0730.jpg) &#8211; but post-tour you wonder why the hell you took photos of some stuff&#8230; still, was a good way to checkout the city all from the comfort of a seat. I like not walking. And especially not having to carry a backpack.

We did a few more typicalÂ AmsterdamÂ things; went to the Van Gogh museum (here&#8217;s where I mention Drew and Ash got of the tram, then the driver closed the door before I could even get off. Bastard.), took a photo of myself [standing on a giant Amsterdam sign](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0731.jpg), went to the [Heinekin brewery](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0733.jpg), [slept in a giant clog](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0751.jpg), drank some beers, and [cut up my hand in a restaurant](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0757.jpg). Good times!

But back to the Heinekin Brewery. Here, have a few photos:

The morning we caught the train to Berlin we did some basic grocery shopping for supplies to keep our bellies full on the 6-hour ride at which point I came across a giant ball of cheese. Oh yes, the signalling of the Summer of George (oh how I wanted to [bite into that cheese like it was an apple](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0759.jpg)).

That was yesterday, and I could begin to feel my throat give me a big middle-finger salute. I think I&#8217;m coming down with the swine, my nose is running like a tap and it feels like I&#8217;ve been munching on fibreglass. Good times.

We went for a stroll and came across my [European amigos](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0761.jpg),Â and then made a bee-line for the wall. AÂ couple cool photos for you:

Today we went to the zoo, home to the famous polar bear Knut. Lots of cool animals here, lots of awesome pictures, I&#8217;ll detail this section when I get some more time. Had a pretty decent giant pretzel (to be honest it could have been better), even saw [dad](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0830.jpg), and a few [rangas](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0827.jpg) ðŸ˜‰

Looks like we&#8217;re no longer doing Stockholm (too much of a pain in the butt to get too, way too far from anywhere I want to go after it too). Thinking maybe Prague, or Munich, or who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll just jump a random train and explore wherever it arrives.
