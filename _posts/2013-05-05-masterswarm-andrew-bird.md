# Masterswarm — Andrew Bird

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgKokFIn3_U This was the first album I ever bought, I think. It was 2009, and I was at the Strand bookstore downtown. It was my birthday, and I had a bit of money to spend on things I liked — books, music, anything. And I was discovering agency — rather than getting music other people liked and seeing if I liked it, I got to decide. I saw this album on the shelf: I'd heard of Andrew Bird very tangentially, and I really liked the album art. The title songs looked interesting and — this was all it took. It was summer in New York, but I was realizing there were totally immersive environments elsewhere in the world. I bought a Borges collection that day, too — I would read it and pretend I was in Buenos Aires, with all its metaphysics. And this album, this remained (remains!) unintelligible. I don't have a clue what it's about. There's imagery of parasites, homunculi, life cycles, hive minds; it's comprehensive and complete and impenetrable.
