# Mr. Hurricane — Beast

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eHaps3Ykqk In the very beginning, I discovered new music through iTunes — there would be free singles each week, one famous, ten or twelve not-so-much. I was young (8th grade or so) and I picked the songs which I liked the most. This, I judged from the 30-second clips they played; a song had to have lyrics I wanted to know more about, a sound I was interested in, and a name I liked. I didn't know you could look up full songs on YouTube (did YouTube even exist then?) so if I wanted a song, that was the one and only way to get it — and I did agonize over the free downloads, wanting to be discerning even then. This was one that stuck with me — my first taste of trip-hop, music that was _modern_, neither jazz nor rock nor classical. There were banging drums, a chorus, angry sounds and smooth sounds and a syncopation I loved. That was all it took for me to like a song then — I didn't know the context, I didn't know whether my friends knew or liked it. I didn't even care what it was about.
