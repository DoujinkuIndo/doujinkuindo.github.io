*In this demo, Patrick Donnelly, a software engineer with Red Hat and the project team lead for the Ceph distributed file system, demonstrated how the Cloud Native Computing Foundation‘s Rook cloud native storage orchestrator works as an operator in its use within the Kubernetes architecture. He also showed how it is used to orchestrate storage for Kubernetes clusters.*
