title: My Kubernetes Cluster

I've decided to setup a Kubernetes cluster using Digital Ocean, and thought I'd track and document my progress on this site. 

As similar with other providers Digital Ocean offer Kubernetes as a manged service, which suits me fine, as it means I can get hands on with configuring and deployment apps rather than spending a heap of time setting up masters and nodes.
