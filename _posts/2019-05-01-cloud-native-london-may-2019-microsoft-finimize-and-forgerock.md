We were at a different venue for our May Cloud Native London meetup - thanks to [Monzo](https://monzo.com/), who hosted us!

First up as always, thanks to our sponsors [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Contino](https://www.contino.io/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/), [ForgeRock](https://www.forgerock.com/) and [GridGain](https://www.gridgain.com/)


First was a discussion of the Azure SQL Database, then An intro to EKS, wrapping up with a talk on the ForgeRock identity platform.

Manish Kumar from Microsoft gave us a talk on ["Intelligent Performance of Azure SQL Database"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UlgHRTDhENqH8MpiE3yTZZA2woDsjB-Q), mentioning:

* What are the Intelligent Performance features which makes Azure SQL DB one of the most Intelligent databases in cloud.
* How to use these features to see performance overview of your database and get performance recommendations that can improve the workload performance.
* How to find top resources consuming queries, intelligent insights and when to let Azure SQL DB optimise itself automatically.

Following that, Matt Dalton from Finimize discussed ["An intro to EKS - managed Kubernetes from AWS"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13ORAYnBeiPRqxc8M2DPRK-h7JHBetLYx), mentioning that:

* Kubernetes brings a host of well-known benefits for teams looking to scale their infrastructure. However, for smaller teams, self-managed Kubernetes clusters can become a maintenance headache. Until recently, AWS has lacked a managed option to help alleviate these problems, but EKS is now being rolled out worldwide.
* EKS manages your master nodes for you (including e.g. updates), while your worker nodes are built automatically on standard auto-scaling EC2 servers. You pay a flat rate for the managed nodes, then are charged for any EC2 infrastructure.
* The setup process uses 2 Cloud Formation templates to build this for you. Understanding what has been built can be a little difficult, and it's worth understanding this if you're looking to build multiple clusters.

Finally Andrew Potter from ForgeRock talked about ["ForgeRock - the most cloud friendly identity platform"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AemMg1EUh-lOpGFcstDeSPiVEBJuP4-B). His takeaways were that:

* Identity is the centre of everything: ForgeRock provide the most simple and comprehensive Identity & Access Management Solution to help our customers deepen relationships with their consumers, and improve the productivity and connectivity of their employees and partners.
* Cloud Deployment Models: The forgeops repository on GitHub contains artifacts you can use to deploy the ForgeRock Identity Platform in a cloud environment with t-shirt sizing of 1, 10, & 100 million users. The ForgeRock Cloud Deployment Team has developed Helm charts, Docker images, performance benchmarks, and other artifacts expressly to build the Cloud Deployment Model (CDM) on GKE, EKS, & AKS. The CDM is a common use ForgeRock Identity Platform architecture, designed to be easy to deploy and easy to replicate. https://www.forgerock.com/platform/iam-devops-deployment
* ForgeRock Identity Cloud: The ForgeRock Identity Cloud is an extremely developer-friendly identity as a service (IDaaS), providing rapid time to value when bringing identity to customer-facing web, mobile, and single-page applications. It is built with a shared-nothing architecture approach to keep consumer data secure in the cloud and is designed to grow with your business and use cases.
