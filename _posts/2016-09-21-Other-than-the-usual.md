Many people question why I program.  They ask since I am not CS or ITM, why do I code.  Truthfully, why don't you?

If your future was created today, what would you do?  Because that is what I am doing.  I am creating my future and all I can see is  the need to have not only computer knowledge under my belt, but the next best thing.  Coding, propraming, all of that and the skills that come with it.  I didn't choose CS or ITM because I felt that it would limit me to only that, rather, I chose Communications.  This gives me a unique approach to things.  I am able to be in a position of knowing how to create UI as well as have the skills to be in person with people and clients.  I feel that this is very unique and special to be able to have.  

It is true that I may not practice the more humanities side of my degree, but I will never pass on how much it had done and does for me each day in my more advanced classes. I am all about programming, mainly web design, and the words that go into it do matter.  They matter a lot actually.
