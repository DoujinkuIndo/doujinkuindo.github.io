![48 Control](/images/dc48.jpg)

Control is found in detachment. It is not that you own nothing, but rather nothing owns you. Maintaining control requires an alert and expansive state of awareness. You are not just "going with the flow" but rather embracing and making constructive use of it. Control is the art of learning from everything. It turns stumbling blocks into stepping-stones and obstacles into opportunities. Everything serves our highest good if we make good use of it.
