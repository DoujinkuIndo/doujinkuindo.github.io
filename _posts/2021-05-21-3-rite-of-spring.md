Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock**! This is blog #3, where I’m still in my first month of my gap year. I didn’t anticipate doing anything extraordinary for the first month or so into my gap year, but I’m definitely taking advantage of the newfound freedom to do more local activities as New York City slowly lifts its pandemic-related restrictions.

### What I’ve been up to

I’ve been fully enjoying the nice weather in New York before the summer heat rolls around. On one Friday, I discovered a new deli near my apartment, bought a buffet box with a cold soda, and enjoyed my lunch on the Prospect Park grass underneath a giant tree. On another weekend, I joined with a college friend from out of town to catch up, do a bit of shopping, and dine in Manhattan. Most other times, I’ve been keeping up with an exercise schedule whenever I can get up in the morning.

I’ve also ridden a Citi bike for the first time! Last time I rode a bike in general was around 5 years ago, partially because I had a fear of riding bikes in New York City and getting run over. However, I live near an area with dedicated bike lanes, so getting back onto a bike felt much safer. The first-time experience is summarized as such:
* The first 30 seconds back on the bike - a bit of apprehension as I got my bearings on my balance and the bike controls.
* The next couple of minutes riding downhill - a joy to feel the wind rushing past me and passing by pedestrians.
* The handful of minutes pedaling uphill - OOF, I didn’t realize that Citi bikes were a pain to pedal up, even with the right gear.
* The last few minutes - trying not to crash as I pedal down the bike lane with jelly legs and find a docking station.

It was definitely not the best biking experience I’ve had, but I certainly see the appeal of riding a Citi bike to get around places quickly. Once I get some practice runs down, the next step would be to bike the roads to get around.

Finally, a couple of weeks ago, I also purchased some D&D miniatures to paint. I’ve been doing this activity on occasion since the pandemic started, as it was a good way to spend a couple of hours relaxing, listening to YouTube videos in the background, and painting obscenely small figurines with a tiny paintbrush. For this round, these are [D&D miniatures for the “Elf Paladin”](https://twentysidedstore.com/products/mini-d-d-nolzurs-marvelous-elf-paladin-male?_pos=1&_sid=6ebb5ff71&_ss=r), which looked unique. (Plus, I'm a sucker for sword-wielding minis.)

### What I’ve learned

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been doing an exercise routine to get back into running. Last week, I was able to run around 4 miles in about 50 minutes. That’s around a 12:30 pace, which is more of a jogging pace, but I’ve always come out of the jog feeling satisfied and not about to keel over. My goal is to be able to continuously jog a 10k, which I’ve never done before. I’ve done a bit of noodling on the internet to find tips, and I wanted to share my findings and experiences here.

A particular jogging article invoked my memory of my love-hate relationship with my high school P.E. classes. On one hand, I enjoyed P.E. because I genuinely enjoyed playing sports and always passed the class feeling healthier. On the other hand, the fitness tests were the worst things in the world. The athletes in the class blew through the fitness test without an issue, while the others (including me) lagged behind on the track field. The [pacer test](https://fitnessgram.net/pacertest/) was particularly terrible, and I was always left out of breath and tasting blood at the back of my throat. I could hold my ground on the sit-ups, but that was about it. It sucked.

Throughout high school and college, I’ve done fencing to keep up with my fitness. It involved a combination of tactics and power-based movements. I eventually supplemented my fencing practice with strength training and treadmill running. Leg day was never a problem, but I still had issues with running longer than 2 miles at a time until a year into this workout montage. I decided not to continue the sport after college, mostly because of the amount of equipment to carry and maintain.

So what’s the point of explaining my background? Getting back into running for fitness has been a lot of reconditioning my brain around running. Running is now becoming my physical maintenance, rather than a supplement to a sport or a requirement for class. Most of the types of fitness and sports I’ve been able to keep up with were more power-based and sprint-based - a lot of anaerobic workouts. That is to say, a burst of power without needing oxygen to sustain the power, because you’d be too tired to sustain the power. The fitness things I’ve learned in the past won’t work for 10k training, or other long-distance running.

As I went through some articles on how to run better, there were running tips that only dig through the reasons on a very superficial level. As a nerd, I decided to dig more into what actually goes on while I’m jogging and exercising. (It’s a long list of articles that I didn’t keep track of, but [one article from Livestrong](https://www.livestrong.com/article/531257-the-effects-of-jogging-every-day/) is an example I’ve saved.)

Your breathing is a muscle, and it needs to be conditioned. Your entire heart is a muscle, and the diaphragm is the muscle that sits under your lungs to really help get air into the lungs. Your heart and your lungs help to bring that sweet, sweet oxygen into the rest of your body. Your body needs that oxygen to break down the stored fuel in your body (particularly glycogen in the muscles when running), so you can continue running.

Like lifting weights in the gym, going too fast too soon on running can result in injuries, pain, and discouragement from trying again. I’ve fallen into this trap of running too fast to keep up, and giving up on consistently running because the suffering outweighed the benefits.

Before I got my vaccine, I only took longer walks to keep up with my fitness. Running with a mask was impossible for me because my fitness was not good enough to get oxygen through a mask. However, the longer walks have made me more patient with running longer distances, since I can cover more distance with the same amount of time!

I could focus more on my breathing, how my feet are hitting the pavement, thoughts buzzing in my head, etc. Eventually, I could start adding an extra 5 minutes of jogging, or be able to do a sprint here or there without feeling winded afterwards. Literally, training to run is a marathon, not a sprint.

Breathing through the stomach vs. chest. Speaking of the diaphragm… it is THE muscle of breathing. It sits underneath your lungs. When it contracts, it causes your lungs to have a negative pressure, so air automatically fills your lungs. When it relaxes, it causes your lungs to have a positive pressure, so air automatically exits your lungs. Magic, right? That is why every running article out in the Internet emphasizes breathing from the stomach.

Why is there the talk about chest breathing not being ideal? Chest breathing involves the muscles around your neck, shoulders, and chest to lift your rib cage. Lifting the rib cage creates negative and positive pressures to let air through your lungs. However, that method pulls your bones against gravity. That takes a lot more effort to breathe than breathing from the stomach.

Learning how to accept setbacks. Have you had the time where you set up a great routine for an exercise habit you wanted to build? You kept it up for a couple of weeks, but then something came up and you had to skip a workout, or you felt like you needed to catch up and ended up injuring yourself, so you paused for a week, and now you’re behind. Then in a few weeks, that exercise “habit” became a thing of the past. Oh yes, me included.

For the first couple of runs, I’ve timed myself to get a baseline of how fast I ran vs. where I was in the track. There were days where I hit a massive streak of runs, and other times I’ve massively missed my target.

One thing I keep in mind is that the setback may be due to a number of factors, including:
* It’s too hot outside and I’m exhausted. I may need to rearrange my schedule to run in the mornings more, and make sure I hydrate myself in advance.
* I’m getting out of breath. I take a couple of minutes to take a walk and catch my breath. After 5 minutes, I resume jogging. Any jogging is good jogging.
* I woke up at 2am for no reason, then tilted because a pigeon s*** on my shirt as I was walking to the track, so I went back to my apartment to change shirts. (Yes, this happened to me recently). Well, I’m happy I did some jogging, and I’m going to get some better sleep tonight.
* I’m just not running as well as I was the previous jog. Have I been eating as well as I should’ve? Did I hydrate myself? Am I ruminating about something?

Sometimes, it’s a matter of “failing fast” - accept that the workout didn’t go as planned, figure out the root cause, then try again the next time. The ultimate goal is to get myself on my feet.

Rest days are no joke. A fun fact - I run 4 times per day. And yet, I’ve progressed from a 20-minute jog to around a 50-minute jog in a couple of weeks. Rest days are nice to give space for actual rest, or to do different physical activities like biking or swimming. It makes sure that you don’t get bored of doing the same thing everyday. It also helps to not overexert the same muscles everyday and potentially cause injury.

### What I’ve seen

Tada - custom title! Now that I have an email list set up, the next thing I wanted to do was to create a logo to plaster on the blog and emails. This logo came out from:
* An idea inspired in the shower
* A pencil sketch and inking
* An experimental splash of watercolor (which came out meh)
* Editing on Procreate to remove the watercolor and adjust the letter alignment

I wanted something a little unique with a slightly spooky vibe. I aimed to have a green/fuchsia color palette to represent [an archfey warlock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/713-warlock-101-the-archfey) (think of the [Grimms’ Fairy Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales) in their rawest form), but I don’t have enough watercolor skills to get the colors arranged the way I wanted to. Perhaps in the next chapter, I will get the color palette nailed down.

### A chapter closed

Thank you for reading this blog post! I was hoping to make the blog shorter, but I hope you enjoy the things I’ve learned so far as much as I have. Blog posts take me way longer for me to write than I thought, and I keep thinking on how it does detract some time from doing other shenanigans. However, it’s also a good way to reflect on the shenanigans I’ve been doing over the past few weeks as part of my gap year, and see what is in store for me in the next few weeks.

I will continue posting updates through LinkedIn and my [email subscription list](https://www.warunlock.com/subscribe/). If you have any questions, feedback, etc. - don’t hesitate to send an email through [susanna@warunlock.com](mailto:susanna@warunlock.com)! The blog is still a living experiment, and I hope to get it a little more polished and interesting with every blog post.

Please stay safe, and take care!
