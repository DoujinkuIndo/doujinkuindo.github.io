Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock**! This is blog #3, where I’m still in my first month of my gap year. I didn’t anticipate doing anything extraordinary for the first month or so into my gap year, but I’m definitely taking advantage of the newfound freedom to do more local activities as New York City slowly lifts its pandemic-related restrictions.

### What I’ve been up to

I’ve been fully enjoying the nice weather in New York before the summer heat rolls around. On one Friday, I discovered a new deli near my apartment, bought a buffet box with a cold soda, and enjoyed my lunch on the Prospect Park grass underneath a giant tree. On another weekend, I joined with a college friend from out of town to catch up, do a bit of shopping, and dine in Manhattan. Most other times, I’ve been keeping up with an outdoors running schedule whenever I can get up in the cooler morning.

I’ve also ridden a Citi bike for the first time! Last time I rode a bike in general was around 5 years ago, partially because I had a fear of riding bikes in New York City and getting run over. However, I live near an area with dedicated bike lanes, so getting back onto a bike felt much safer. The first-time experience is summarized as such:
* *The first 30 seconds back on the bike* - A bit of apprehension as I got my bearings on my balance and the bike controls.
* *The next couple of minutes riding downhill* - A joy to feel the wind rushing past me and passing by pedestrians.
* *The handful of minutes pedaling uphill* - OOF, I didn’t realize that Citi bikes were a pain to pedal up, even with the right gear.
* *The last few minutes* - Trying not to crash as I pedal down the bike lane with jelly legs and find a docking station.

It was definitely not the best biking experience I’ve had, but I certainly see the appeal of riding a Citi bike to get around places quickly. Once I get some practice runs down, the next step would be to bike the roads to get around.

Finally, a couple of weeks ago, I also purchased some D&D miniatures to paint. I’ve been doing this activity on occasion since the pandemic started, as it was a good way to spend a couple of hours relaxing, listening to YouTube videos in the background, and painting obscenely small figurines with a tiny paintbrush. For this round, these are [D&D miniatures for the “Elf Paladin”](https://twentysidedstore.com/products/mini-d-d-nolzurs-marvelous-elf-paladin-male?_pos=1&_sid=6ebb5ff71&_ss=r), which looked unique. (Plus, I'm a sucker for sword-wielding minis.)

### What I’ve learned

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been doing an exercise routine to get back into running and to be able to enjoy the prospect of scuba diving more. Last week, I was able to run around 4 miles in about 50 minutes. That’s around a 12:30 pace, which is more of a jogging pace, but I’ve always come out of the jog feeling satisfied and not about to keel over. My goal is to be able to continuously jog a 10k, which I’ve never done before. I’ve done a bit of noodling on the internet to find tips, and I wanted to share my findings and experiences here.

A particular jogging article invoked my memory of my love-hate relationship with my high school P.E. classes. While I genuinely enjoyed playing sports, the fitness tests were the worst. The athletes in the class blew through the fitness test without an issue, while the others (including me) lagged behind on the track field. The [pacer test](https://fitnessgram.net/pacertest/) was particularly terrible, and I was always left out of breath and tasting blood at the back of my throat. I could hold my ground on the sit-ups, but that was about it. It sucked.

Throughout high school and college, I’ve done fencing to keep up with my fitness. It involved a combination of tactics and power-based movements. I eventually supplemented my fencing practice with strength training and treadmill running. Leg day was never a problem, but I still had issues with running longer than 2 miles at a time until a year into this workout montage. I decided not to continue the sport after college because of the amount of equipment to carry and maintain.

Getting back into running now has been a lot of reconditioning my brain around running. Running is now my physical maintenance, rather than a supplement to a sport or a requirement for class. Most of the types of fitness and sports I’ve been able to keep up with were mostly anaerobic workouts - short bursts of power without needing oxygen to sustain the power. The training I’ve learned in the past won’t work for the aerobic long-distance running.

As I went through some articles on how to run better, there were running tips that only dig through the reasons on a very superficial level. As a nerd, I decided to dig more into what actually goes on while I’m jogging and exercising. (It’s a long list of articles that I didn’t keep track of, but [one article from Livestrong](https://www.livestrong.com/article/531257-the-effects-of-jogging-every-day/) is an example that I’ve saved.)

#### Your breathing is a muscle, and it needs to be conditioned.

Your heart and your lungs help to bring that sweet, sweet oxygen into the rest of your body. Your body needs that oxygen to break down the stored fuel in your body (particularly glycogen in the muscles when running), so your muscles can continue keep up with the running.

Your entire heart is a muscle, and the diaphragm is the muscle that sits under your lungs to really help get air into the lungs. Like lifting weights in the gym, going too fast too soon on running can result in injuries, pain, and discouragement from trying again. I’ve fallen into this trap of running too fast to keep up, and end up unable to catch my breath before my legs were tired.

Even though I jog at a slower pace, I could focus more on my breathing, how my feet are hitting the pavement, and my mental state. Once I got into a flow, I could start adding an extra 5 minutes of jogging, or be able to do a sprint occasionally without feeling winded afterwards.

#### Breathing through the stomach vs. chest.

The diaphragm is THE muscle of breathing that sits underneath your lungs. When it contracts, it causes your lungs to have a negative pressure, so air automatically fills your lungs. When it relaxes, it causes your lungs to have a positive pressure, so air automatically exits your lungs. Magic, right? That is why every running article out in the Internet emphasizes breathing from the stomach.

What about chest breathing? Chest breathing involves the muscles around your neck, shoulders, and chest to lift your rib cage. Lifting the rib cage creates negative and positive pressures to let air through your lungs. However, that method pulls your bones against gravity. That takes a lot more effort to breathe than breathing from the stomach.

#### Learning how to accept setbacks.

There were days where I hit a streak of runs, and other times I’ve massively missed my target distance, or felt more exhausted than usual. I fear the many times where this small setback will pile up, and eventually this exercise "habit" will be a thing of the past.

One thing I keep in mind is that the setback may be due to a number of factors, including:
* *It’s too hot outside and I’m exhausted.* I may need to rearrange my schedule to run in the mornings more, and make sure I hydrate myself in advance.
* *I’m running out of breath during my jog.* I take a couple of minutes to take a walk and catch my breath, then think why I was running out of breath. Did I pace myself? Did I breathe through my stomach? After 5 minutes, I resume jogging.
* *I woke up at 2am for no reason, then tilted because a pigeon `s***` on me as I was walking to the track, so I went back to my apartment to change shirts.* Well, I’m happy I went out and did some jogging, and I’m going to get some better sleep tonight.
* *I’m just not running as well as I was the previous jog.* Have I been eating as well as I should’ve? Did I hydrate myself? Am I ruminating about something?

The ultimate goal is to get myself on my feet and get healthier. This would involve a combination of making time and space for it, being consistent, and giving some slack if things don't work out despite everything I've tried.

#### Jogging alone is not great for losing weight.

This was something that stood out to me in high school. I gained 5 pounds when I started P.E., and then lost 7 pounds when the school year ended and I stopped regularly running - a net 2 pound lost.

The same thing happened to me as I started my jogging routine. Without changing my diet as I started jogging, I gained 5 pounds almost overnight. My guess is that I gained more muscle and started drinking more water to hydrate properly. Despite the weight gain, the benefits of having better heart health is well worth it. (BUT I hope to start burning some fat after a couple of weeks.)

Articles I've come across have been wishy-washy about whether jogging makes for good weight loss. They agree more that diet is essential for both weight loss and exercise performance. (I'll write a future blog post on diet and cooking, as I've spent a lot of time on everything FOOD.)

As a last tip: reward yourself occasionally after exercising, but NEVER with food! The last thing you want is to offset the calories you've burned with a calorie bomb, and associate exercise with food.

### What I’ve seen

<img src="/images/blog3-logo_wip.jpg" width="400"> <img src="/images/warunlock_logo.png" width="400">

Tada - custom title! Now that I have an email list set up, the next thing I wanted to do was to create a logo to plaster on the blog and emails. This logo came out from:
* An idea inspired in the shower
* A pencil sketch and inking
* An experimental splash of watercolor (which came out meh)
* Editing on Procreate to remove the watercolor and adjust the letter alignment

I wanted something a little unique with a slightly spooky vibe. I aimed to have a green/fuchsia color palette to represent [an archfey warlock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/713-warlock-101-the-archfey) (think of the [Grimms’ Fairy Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales) in their rawest form), but I don’t have enough watercolor skills to get the colors arranged the way I wanted to. Perhaps in the next chapter, I will get the color palette nailed down.

### A chapter closed

Thank you for reading this blog post! I was hoping to make the blog shorter, but I hope you enjoy the things I’ve learned so far as much as I have. Blog posts take me way longer for me to write than I thought, and I keep thinking on how it does detract some time from doing other shenanigans. However, it’s also a good way to reflect on the shenanigans I’ve been doing over the past few weeks as part of my gap year, and see what is in store for me in the next few weeks.

I will continue posting updates through LinkedIn and my [email subscription list](https://www.warunlock.com/subscribe/). If you have any questions, feedback, etc. - don’t hesitate to send an email through [susanna@warunlock.com](mailto:susanna@warunlock.com)! The blog is still a living experiment, and I hope to get it a little more polished and interesting with every blog post.

Please stay safe, and take care!
