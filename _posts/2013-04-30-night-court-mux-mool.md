# Night Court — Mux Mool

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEgI-virsY This year, these are things that won't be memories or articles or song associations for some time — not until I can ruminate will they become important life-building events. Still, this song might be a theme song for the first improv shows I did here at college in front of an audience, just a semester ago. I know I'll have more to say in a few years; I'll be able to attribute more to this song, to say what it got me though, to, away from; here, it's just an association, no context. Memories need fermenting before they can be strung up like negatives and inspected.
