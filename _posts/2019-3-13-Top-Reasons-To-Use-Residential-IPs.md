Here are some of the top reasons why you might benefit from using residential IPs:

1) You're less likely to get blocked. Nowadays many website owners and publishers block traffic coming from datacenter IPs. Why? Many companies do it to protect themselves. With residential IPs, that's no longer a problem. Now you can have the security and privacy similar to that of a VPN, with the practicality similar to that of using your home connection.

2) Faster web surfing. With our high-quality opt-in network, you're provided with the best residential IPs available on the market.

3) Unblocking Geo-filtered content. Residential IPs allow you to access content that you might not have had access to before because of geo restrictions.

4) Travel Deals. Now you can check out travel sites from different locations to see if you can score a better deal on that next vacation.
