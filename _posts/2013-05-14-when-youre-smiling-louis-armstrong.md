# When You're Smiling — Louis Armstrong

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOH_mioL3TU This song conjures around it a soundtrack, complete and self-sufficient, contained and immersive; New York in the 30s, driving across bridges towards the skyline, black-and-white, maybe a Woody Allen movie. Happy and happy and happy, the day after it rains, driving through and through, onwards to Coney Island, a distraction, a destination, and an era to sink into like a big old couch, still as good as the day it was new. There's no urgency at all in this song — it is a treasure, played by people with nothing to prove; deliberate and unambitious and quietly, distinctively brilliant.
