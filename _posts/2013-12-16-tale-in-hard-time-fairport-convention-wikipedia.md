One thing that strikes be about the pastoral, almost Walden-esque values that appear to lie just beneath the surface of this music is how content and clean it is. It draws on a tradition of British naturalistic poetry. The land is old and all the art has been done before. It has nothing to prove. American music, by contrast, often appears very insecure. The same is true for Nick Drake and Fleetwood Mac. These are songs that deal with small, intimate issues without elevating them to the anthemic, world-rocking, paradigm-shifting scale that (here, I admit, I think of death metal, arena rock, etc) more modern music tends to gravitate to.
When I picture Emerson putting on his stereo, this is the music he listens to.
