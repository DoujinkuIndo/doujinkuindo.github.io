    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a festive background to my blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Unfortunately, I could not complete a festive background for my blog because something odd has happened to my blog and I don't know how to fix it so I am going to go to my teacher and ask him for some advice.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Independence</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If my blog was working then i could have focused and worked entirely on my festive background without a distraction. I could have seen the issue before the lesson to check that everything was working so i didn't need to work on the problem during the lesson.</td>

    <td>If i see a problem  and i have tried to fix it without success i could go to the teacher to ask for some advice of how to mend the issue. If that doesnâ€™t work then i could ask for the teacher to tell me how to restart my github account.</td>
