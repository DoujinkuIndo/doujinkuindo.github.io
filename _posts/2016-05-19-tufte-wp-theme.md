I'm currently testing

This is a test side note. (as at Thursday 19 May 2016) a Wordpress theme [Naturaily/tufte-wp-theme](https://github.com/Naturaily/tufte-wp-theme/tree/master/img) that uses the CSS from [edwardtufte/tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css). You can read more about it

This is a second test side note. from [Dave Liepmann](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
