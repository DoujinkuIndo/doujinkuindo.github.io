I&#8217;m just going to put it out there, but Venice kind of sucks. It&#8217;s interesting for an hour or two, after which point you realise it&#8217;s just annoyingly crowded with tourists and thus everything is priced to match their fat wallets. That said I was just a little more than excited to be somewhere familiar (and where I had at least _some_ understanding of the language) for the first time in about a month and a half. Coincidentally we flew in one year to the day that I flew out of Venice last year.

It was already dark by the time we rocked up, but thankfully we found the hostel pretty quickly and headed straight out to see some stuff.

We were there just for the night so it was a bit of a whirlwind visit. We went and checked out San Marco&#8217;s Square and took photos of canals, and not all too surprisingly found ourselves lost on several occasions. Dave and I somehow walked in circles to the exact same bridge about three times in 15 minutes.

I&#8217;d already taken somewhere in the region of 3,457 photos last time I was in town so I <del>figured it was kind of pointless to take more photos of the same stuff</del> snapped loads more because… I&#8217;m not really sure why.

Tucked away in some little alley we came across an interesting little art gallery, home to a statue of a dude with the severed head of Ronald McDonald along with a painting of Batman fondling Wonder Woman and a naked Marge Simpson. Sure, why not.

  And that&#8217;s the story of Venice.
