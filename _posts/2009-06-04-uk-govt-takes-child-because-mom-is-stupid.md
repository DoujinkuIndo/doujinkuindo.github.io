If you want more evidence of the stupidity of government getting involved in health care and child care, read this:

[British Court Says Woman isn’t Smart Enough to be a Mom](http://www.parentdish.com/2009/06/04/british-court-says-woman-isnt-smart-enough-to-be-a-mom/)

If you’re too lazy to read the link, essentially the British Courts took this woman’s child away because she only has an IQ of 71. She probably just sucks at tests.

To top it off, right now she’s only allowed to visit the baby… 90 minutes a month. This, my friends, is complete bullshit.

Until next time
