Awesome! Generally I'm super happy to travel and speak at conferences and meetups, especially for keynotes and if you can provide support for travel costs.

Recently I've turned down a lot of speaking invitations, so figured I should explain that at the end of August...

...I'm getting married! Nick is a software engineer at Google, originally from Yorkshire, and he blogs about [machine learning and iOS](https://harveynick.com). We got together in 2014 when I was working at Google New York.

I'll still be running [Cloud Native London](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London), but unsurprisingly, wedding planning takes priority until mid-September. Get in touch if you need a speaker after that, and see you around very soon!
