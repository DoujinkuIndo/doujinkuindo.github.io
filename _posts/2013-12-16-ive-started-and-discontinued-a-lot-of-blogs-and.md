I've started and discontinued a lot of blogs and writing platforms. It is endlessly frustrating to be so fickle and impulsive, to have periods of great motivation to do work and have them vanish as quickly as they came.

All of Spring/Summer 2012 I kept a blog (variously called While Rome Burns, Ezekiel Seven, etc) which originally documented music I loved and the circumstances surrounding its discovery. After a few months I began to write about the times and places I came to associate with developmentally pivotal pieces of music. It was difficult to walk the line between being too emotionally revealing and being too cryptic. Eventually I began to write analyses of specific pop songs: their construction and interpretation. This, too, became difficult and unrewarding.
This time around, I won't be limited. No rules: I can write if I like, I can simply post the music. I can write essays. No constraints, no topics, no rules.

The song above is Battle Rhymes for Battle Times by Koushik. I found it through Four Tet's Late Night Tales compilation set. LNT is a series of hour-long continuous mixes in which an artist or producer is asked to compile an album's worth of songs that define their musical influences, inspirations, and origins. I know that Koushik is a Canadian producer, but I don't know too much more about him.

I have a few Late Night Tales albums. They brand themselves as Music & Stories Worth Staying Up For. I like that sentiment. I've often spoken as my musical taste as being bound together by only one defining, genre-spanning characteristic: an artist, album, or song must have been made with intention. No careless art. Something has to be gorgeous, or lyrically proficient, or super dope, or whatever.

I can't find the lyrics to this song anywhere online. This depicts a new paradigm of underground music which I had never before breached. That's super cool.
