Winner of the Social category in the AngelHack SP 2016, (and 2nd place in the general) the app Magrela. The idea was simple: his smart pedal. The application basically shows the best bike routes in SÃ£o Paulo, considering bike paths, aspect of the asphalt and degree of difficulty, among other variables. Magrela was thought in three levels - gadget, hardware and software and works like a collaborative navigator, that talks with the device that you plug in your bike. We have here a kind of Waze of the bikes - and he starts to send us directions via audio of the best route.
