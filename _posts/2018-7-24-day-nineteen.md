I started this morning with a text conversation with Rory about DOLPHOT. I told him about my issue with the terminal not recognizing DOLPHOT's commands, and he told me about adding the folder 'dolphot2.0' to the terminal's PATH. It's required that the PATH include whatever directories hold the commands you want to use -- assuming they're not biult-in (like almost everything). This is some really basic "how to use the terminal" stuff, but I honestly didn't know it until now. Better late than never, I guess. It makes a lot of sense in the context of everything else I know about computer science, though. So, let's give adding dolphot2.0 to the PATH a shot. In his blog, Rory reccomended [this page](https://hathaway.cc/2008/06/how-to-edit-your-path-environment-variables-on-mac/) for learning how to do just that. 

Following those simple directions, I opened the '.bash_profile' document and found out that it is locked and I can't edit it. No problem; I also saw that the current PATH unsurprisingly points to the 'anaconda/bin' directory, so I'll just move 'dolphot2.0' there and see what happens. Actually, on second thought, I'll just copy all the files in 'dolphot2.0/bin' and paste them into 'anaconda/bin'. I think this is smarter based on how I think computers look at things in directories. 

After I did that, I moved back to the [PYDOLPHOT tutorial](https://github.com/dweisz/pydolphot) with my fingers crossed and heart racing hoping everything works now.
