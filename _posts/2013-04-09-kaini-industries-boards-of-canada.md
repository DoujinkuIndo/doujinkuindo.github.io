# Kaini Industries — Boards of Canada

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm388S1889s This song seems to have taken a page out of Borges' book: rather than construct an elaborate story with characters, plots, dialogue, themes and symbolism, he would write only the plot outlines, and then a literary criticism by someone who had read the full story; the brilliance would shine through, but without the trappings of literary constructions. Similarly, this song is just the bare riff, a simple, perfect melody with no need for introduction or denouement, unadorned. It's uniquely musical, no need for timbre or lyrics or meaning — there's no authorial intent to derive, no mood to be extracted, just a mathematical series of rhythms and harmonies that sound good together, for some definition and value of 'good'.
