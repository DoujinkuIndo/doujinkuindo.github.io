[Cheryl Hung on Trends in Cloud Native and DevOps for 2021 - InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/04/cheryl-hung-2021-trends/)

> In a recent keynote for The DEVOPS Conference, Cheryl Hung, VP ecosystem for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), shared her top 10 predictions for cloud native in the upcoming year. This includes improvements in cross cloud support, growth in GitOps and chaos engineering practices, and an increase in the adoption of FinOps.
>
> Hung notes that 83% of respondents in the 2020 CNCF survey are running Kubernetes within production. This heavy usage of Kubernetes is mirrored in the catalog of CNCF projects. For example, Flux is a tool to enable the GitOps methodology with Kubernetes. This approach focuses on declaratively describing the entire desired state within git. As Hung notes, with GitOps "you get a perfect audit log through your entire infrastructure and it's easy for you to roll back in case there are any problems."
>
>Two recent CNCF projects, Litmus and Chaos Mesh, focus on enabling chaos engineering practices within Kubernetes environments. Hung explains that "I think [chaos engineering] is actually a very sensible way to handle infrastructure problems and I'm a little bit surprised that it's not already more widespread."
>
>FinOps is a recent movement attempting to bring financial accountability to provide more transparency on cloud spending. Hung describes it as "a group of practitioners who are trying to find the best practices and tooling to really understand and optimize where cloud is being used and how to reduce that from an organization's point of view."
>
>InfoQ sat down with Hung to discuss these predictions and trends in more detail.
