[Markdown cheatsheet] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* Change the file name to include today’s date and the title of your post. 

* Jekyll requires posts to be named year-month-day-title.md.

* Update the title at the top of the Markdown file. Those variables at the top of the blog post are called front matter, which we’ll dig into a little later. In this case, they specify which layout to use and the title of the blog post. Additional front-matter variables exist, such as permalink, tags and category.
