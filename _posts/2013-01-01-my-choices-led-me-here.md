<pre>
I am here because of my choices, my decisions.
Because of my actions and my inactions.
Like it, or like it not.
That is the why.
You could accurately say "I chose to be here".
The choices ahead, they will determine where I go.

Where are you?

And where are you going?

Are you choices leading you where you want to go?
