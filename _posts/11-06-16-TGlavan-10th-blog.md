You are . . . Machinima

Moving on from the really bad attempt at a pun, its okay if you want to leave I completely understand, I will be recapping Nakamura's essay on the racialization of "Chinese gold farmers" in World of Warcraft (WoW).

Reseach Question:

* Topic -  Racialization of online communities

* Question - How do community creations on Machinima reflect the attitudes of the entire WoW community

* Significance - Online user media creation is by no means exclusive to WoW so the aggresive nature towards "Chinese player workers" is likely not an isolated occurence in the Wow community

Argument:

* Claim - Not all of the WoW community is racist towards "Chinses player workers"

* Reasons - Those who have strong opinions about something are more likeley to vocalize those opinions, specifically if they're are negative as whatever they stand against 

* Evidence - 

* Alternatives - 

* Warrents - 

Summary:
