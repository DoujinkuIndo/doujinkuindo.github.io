Damien&#8217;s band finally had their first gig&#8230; I missed Brother (ex Bagster/Mr Vengeance), but turned up in time for Running Bear With Eagle Eye&#8230; or something like that. Pretty funny guys, not too bad.

The Camel Tigers did well. Not sure if they&#8217;ll hate me for this, but reminded me of Unpaid Debt. Well, the vocals at least. Nice strong crowd out to support them as well.

  Then came Ebolagoldfish. &#8216;TwasÂ  a little bit sad, they had maybe 15 people watching them.
