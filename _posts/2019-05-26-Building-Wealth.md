A couple of years ago I had the great privilege of partaking in the excellent Enterprise Engineer Program in [RBS][1]. 
This was jointly organized by Digital Engineering Services and [Catalyst][2]. 

The amount of knowledge, lessons and skills I took out of it is a future post by itself.

What I would like to share with you is my end-of-course TED-style presentation.     

## The subject

The subject of my presentation is something I had to learn (and still learning) the hard way: wealth and money.  
Is there something I could distill as knowledge? Something which could be useful and actionable?    

The recorded presentation is embedded below.
If the frame does not render, you can view it [directly on Youtube here][3].  

The sound is not great, unfortunately; you may need to switch on subtitles.
Cultural references were targeted to the audience, a mix of British and Indian colleagues. 

I hope you find it useful!<sup>if my monotonous voice does not send you to sleep :-)</sup>

## Parting thought

Our financial well-being should be something we take as seriously as our physical and mental health.  
Without me pretending to be an expert on it, I hope this presentation will make you see things under 
a different light.
