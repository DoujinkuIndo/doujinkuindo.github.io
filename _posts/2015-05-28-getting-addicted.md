Hmm, this might be an addictive problem, I can start work a little later tomorrow but I'm gonna be awfully tired.
No fancy changes but lots of learning (I think):
- Finally fixed jaikrishnan.com vs. www.jaikrishnan.com
- Went through the process of installing and implementing jekyll, only to realize that I'm pretty sure I don't need to do that it if I'm hosting through github!
- Starting looking at the css stylesheet, something to think about tomorrow
Key open question for a friend: when using jekyll with github pages, do you just write posts directly in github/prose? Or do you still clone locally, edit, and push?
