title: The end of the first semester
---

I am just about to finish the first semester of my first year at [matfyz](http://matfyz.cz).
It was a brand new experience for me.
Everything seemed almost too hard at the beginning but, gradually, it got better.
We learned a lot of new exciting stuff and revised what we already knew.
There was a lot of work to do, but now I can say, it was totally worth the effort.

I'm glad I got the chance to study at such a great university,
which [Charles University](https://cuni.cz) definitely is.
The only thing that's left to do to end the semester properly are the final exams.
I already passed one exam ahead of next week's upcomming final exam period.
Today I had another one and I don't know how it turned out, yet. So, I have at least
3 more to go.

All in all, it was a very exciting semester, and I hope I get to stay here and
learn a lot more!

*EDIT 7.1.2015, 20:15: Apparently, I passed today's exams too!*
