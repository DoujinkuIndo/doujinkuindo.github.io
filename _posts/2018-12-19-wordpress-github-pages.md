title: 'From WordPress to Github Pages'
draft: false
tags: [GitHub, wordpress]

This blog was just migrated from WordPress to GitHub Pages.  It uses a GitHub repo forked from the Jekyll Now [https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo and markdown.  

This setup with GitHub Pages is so less complicated (from my standpoint!) than where it started; self-hosted ASP.NET, joomla then WordPress, finally hosted WordPress.   Maintaining WordPress was just way overboard for this blog.  

The publishing flow follows my work workflows. Git repo, commit, push, build and deploy.  Markdown is also ~~becoming~~ the basis for everything documentation so I found the whole solution to be perfect.
