suggested workflow:

make first changes on /index local version

send changes to /index on website via pythonanywhere folder

make changes to /home local version
-copy over index.html to main_page.html, then change the javascript it calls back to main_page
-copy over index.js to main_page.js
-copy text_analysis2 to text_analysis, don't forget to delete the extra two
-in flask_app: change (results, verbs) = analyze_text2(text) to (results, verbs) = analyze_text(text) (get rid of the 2)

send changes to /home on website
