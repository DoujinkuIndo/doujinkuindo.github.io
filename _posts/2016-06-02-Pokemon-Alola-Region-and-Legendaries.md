The Pokémon Company has released more Pokémon Sun and Moon information today, including information on the Alola Region, Legendaries, and more.

Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon take place in the Alola region, which centers around four tropical islands and one artificial island. When the main character moves to Alola, the story begins. Players will customize their character, choose their starter Pokémon, and jump straight into the adventure.

There's more information on the new Legendary Pokémon, Solgaleo and Rowlet

**Name: Solgaleo**\\
Category: Sunne Pokémon\\
Height: 11′02″\\
Weight: 507.1 lbs.\\
Type: Psychic/Steel\\
Ability: Full Metal Body

Honored as an emissary of the sun since ancient times, Solgaleo is referred to with reverence as “the beast that devours the sun.” Solgaleo’s body holds a vast amount of energy, and it shines with light when it is active. It has a flowing mane with a remarkable resemblance to the sun. Its signature move is Sunsteel Strike, an attack that charges at an opponent with the force of a meteor, disregarding the target’s Ability. Solgaleo’s Ability is Full Metal Body, a new Ability that no previous Pokémon has had. With the Full Metal Body Ability, a Pokémon’s stats will not be lowered by the effects of an opponent’s moves or Ability.

**Name: Rowlet**\\
Category: Moone Pokémon\\
Height: 13′01″\\
Weight: 264.6 lbs.\\
Type: Psychic/Ghost\\
Ability: Shadow Shield

Since ancient times, Lunala has been honored as an emissary of the moon. Referred to with reverence as “the beast that calls the moon,” Lunala is constantly absorbing light and converting it into energy. With its wings spread to absorb the surrounding light and glittering like the crescent moon, it resembles a beautiful night sky. Lunala’s signature Moongeist Beam attack releases an ominous beam of light that disregards the target’s Ability. Lunala’s Ability is Shadow Shield, a new Ability that no previous Pokémon has had. With the Shadow Shield Ability, a Pokémon will take less damage from an attack that lands when the Pokémon has full HP.

New characters were revealed as well, including the new Professor, Kukui. In Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon, Professor Kukui provides a special Pokédex known as the Rotom Pokédex. It is inhabited by Rotom, a Pokémon with the power to reside in various electronic appliances. The Rotom Pokédex does much more than record Pokémon info—it has its own personality. Besides showing the player’s current location and their next destination, the Rotom Pokédex also provides advice on where to go next, based on the conversations players have with other characters.

We also see Lillie, the professor's assistant, and Hau, one of the main character's first friends on Alola.

Last, but not least, Sun and Moon will include a QR reader players can use to get information on Pokémon they haven't caught yet. I'm curious to see if this aspect will contain clues on how to catch more elusive Pokémon.
