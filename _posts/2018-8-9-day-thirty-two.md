Today started with a group meeting with the GRG. We've now all gotten to the point where we are trying to make color-magnitude diagrams. Based on Dr. G's advice, I'm going to work on filtering the results before I start trying to generate any graphs. I didn't think about it until Rory said it, but it is very strange that there's close to 500,000 stars in each drc image, so iltering is necessary. But first, I have to start dolphot running on the last few folders. Rory is taking a few, but I still have three to do. 

# dolphot
So, I changed my laptop again last night. I decided to buy a desktop, so I'm selling my nicer laptop (this one has a better GPU, but has less RAM so can't run dolphot nearly as well). I can do two dolphots at once now, not three. It used to be I had enough RAM that every time I added a new instance, my CPU had to catch up so that each instance of dolphot was about 30% of my CPU. Now that I'm grasping for more RAM, every time I add a new dolphot instance, my CPU has to slow down to let the memory catch up, so I can only do 10% of the CPU per dolphot instance (CPUs are comparable between laptops, this ones slightly worse). No issues on the transfer, though; I still have my data and dolphot and it didn't take long.
