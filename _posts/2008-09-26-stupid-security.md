This sort of thing REALLY annoys me.
[Security through obscurity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) is a FEATURE of this product, the
[Wyse V10L thin client](http://www.wyse.com/products/hardware/thinclients/V10L/index.asp).

To quote:>And, with an unpublished API, Wyse Thin OS is one of the most secure operating systems on the market.

What rot. What that means translated is "not many people know how our stuff works, so therefore not many people can exploit it".

And, yes, this may truly mean that it isn't often exploited. But at some point it will be. Far better to be secure by design than by lack of being a target.
