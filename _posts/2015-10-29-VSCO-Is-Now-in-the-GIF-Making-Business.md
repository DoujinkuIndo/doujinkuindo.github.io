title: VSCO Is Now in the GIF-Making Business
---

GIFs are everywhere nowadays. And on the heals of the iPhone 6s’ Live Photos (yes, I know they aren’t GIFs) comes DSCO by VSCO. The ever popular VSCO released a new app for iOS this morning which allows users to create GIFs, while using a few popular VSCO filters. The app also includes a partnered filter from MTV—which I would _never_ use—and VSCO has promised to release more partnered filters in the “weeks to come.”

Let’s break down my pros and cons.
_These are just my opinion, but I’m sure that there will be others who feel the same way._

Pros:
- A GIF making app from a company I trust that connects directly to:
	- VSCO Grid
	- Twitter
	- Facebook
	- Tumblr
	- Instagram
- Easily selectable filters (just swipe left or right)
- Both the GIF and an image is saved to Photos.app

Cons:
 - No exposure control
- Ugly rainbow progress bar that goes around the screen
- You can’t save or share your GIF unless you post to VSCO Grid

That last con is a big one for me. Maybe I want to post a GIF to Twitter or Instagram—hell, maybe I just want to share one via Messages—but I can’t unless I first post it to VSCO Grid. This is a problem. I could sign out of the app, but then I would have to sign in every time I _did_ want to post to VSCO Grid—granted that would probably be far and few in-between. The app is free and definitely worth checking out, but for now, it isn’t anything to write home about.
