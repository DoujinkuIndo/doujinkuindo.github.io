The 7 JSRs submitted in August for Java EE 8 have been unanimously approved, with 24 'Yes' votes, by the JCP Executive Committee!
The different Specification Leads are now starting to formally assemble their Expert Group (see [instructions](https://jcp.org/en/participation/membership) for joining the JCP). JUG members can also help with any of these JSRs through the Adopt-a-JSR Program. And in case of doubt, just reach out to the Specification Lead you wan to work with, he/she will be able to guide you (e.g. JMS).
Those recently approved JSRs added to CDI 2.0, which was approved a few weeks ago, give us an impressive initial set of 8 JSRs for Java EE 8!
