Yeah, this isn't one of those awesome religion or political posts I promised yesterday, but at least it's somethingâ€¦

> American Engineers have built a robotic snake that could change the way heart surgery is performed.
>
> CardioArm can assist surgeon's procedures, slithering into places in the body too tight or dangerous for ordinary medical tools to enter.
>
> Though it's hardly comfortable, Snakebot is revolutionizing the way heart surgery is performed, mitigating the need for open heart surgery.
>
> Rather than having to crack open patients' ribcage during heart surgery, this slippery little sucker buries itself deep inside your chest via a 2cm hole in your solar plexus and slithers around your organs.
>
> The inventors of CardioArm say this technology has the potential to minimize the time it takes for patients to recover from heart surgery.
>
> Dr. Howie Chosets from the University of Cargenie Mellon in Pennsylvania told Discover magazine: "Instead of cracking open a person's chest we can do a surgery and send patients home the next day."
