title: The Mobile Update
---

The mobile version of this site has been very broken. It took me longer than I expected to fix it, partly because I'm learning as I go because I want to do it right and not patch it together like I have with other mobile sites that I have done.

The first thing I had to do was switch to a mobile-first style website. That way, I have one base stylesheet for mobile, then additional ones for larger devices. As a result, load time is much quicker on mobile because it only needs to load the CSS for the mobile site before rendering. The CSS for the other style rules will be loaded in the background as the user browses the page.

Since I switched to a mobile first site, I also had to rewrite the desktop version as well to put desktop-specific code in a separate stylesheet. So far, there isn't much difference, but expect to see more in the future.

Thanks for bearing with the continual design!  

As always, Have a great day!  
Josiah
