** 1. Which research methods do you most want to learn? **
I most want to learn the research method of writing for the reader. 
I think it would be incredibly helpful to be able to view my research objectively. This would help me to better edit 
by thinking of my research as aconversation.This would allow me to better present myself as someone who is well informed on the topic,
as well as to connect with my reader.

** 2. What topics in digital humanities research interest you? ** 
I have a great interest in the increasing opportunity of real estate for self-promotion that the digital age has offered. 
This in turn brings about the increasing opportunity for commentary, copying, and remixing of otherâ€™s ideas. 
This can bring about incredible inspiration, but it also is an avenue for piracy and mimicry. 
Additionally, I am interested in the increasing presence of distractions that has come with the turn of the century 
and the importance of multitasking that has come with it.

** 3. Which digital literacy especially do you most want to master? **
One thing I find the most difficult is successfully switching my mindset over from one activity or subject to the next. 
This can make the completion of many tasks difficult and can hinder my progress. 
If I were able to successfully multitask, I would likely find that I could get a variety of things done in a day.
