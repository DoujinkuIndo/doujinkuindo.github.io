A good friend of mine, John Cantarella, has been using the training courses provided by
[Train Signal](http://trainsignal.com/). I've had a look over his sholder at some of this stuff and it's fantastic.

The Microsoft Small Business Server 2003 R2 training is 'informal' in the sense that it actually feels like your in the same room with the guy, him telling me how it all fits together.

I wish I'd had something like this two years ago.... ;-)

Thanks to John for letting me take a look at it - he was able to show me some stuff I didn't yet know.
