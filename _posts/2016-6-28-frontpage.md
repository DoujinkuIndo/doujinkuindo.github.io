B.K is an aspiring software engineer and a data believer. Passionate about software development, economical issues, statistics and finance. Fascinated by what can be derived from processed user data.

As a developer, I love having the power to build meaningful and interesting applications. I consider ways to automate any repetitive task when I encounter one. Currently messing with React.Js to build awesome web/mobile applications.
