title: DevConfCZ 2016
---

Whoah, this conference just keeps getting ~~bigger~~ better.
The organizers counted about 1200 people just **in the first day**.
I remember attending about 5-6 years ago, there were about 120 people in total.

Just check out the [#DevConfCZ](https://twitter.com/hashtag/devconfcz?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash)
Twitter hashtag for proof. Also, the coffee from [Kofi Kofi](http://kofikofi.cz/) was just amazing.

Several *minor* problems occured to me during the weekend:

* Lack of recycling trash bins
* 8 parallel sessions, anyone? -- during some time slots, I've definitely been Hermione's TODO. How can you attend 3 talks at the same time? (Answer: YouTube live stream + archive!)
