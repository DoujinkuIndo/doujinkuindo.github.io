Anticipation levels are high and the pre-launch excitement is starting to build. It gives me great pleasure to announce a new blog from the Product and Technology Team @ CarFinance 247 is only a few weeks away.

We'll be using it to share our learnings on how we have, and still are, evolving as a team. Our thoughts and opinions on everything technology related and maybe even show off a little with some of the cool stuff we are building.

The next post you see will be from our Technology Director Jonathan Wilson who will officially kick things off. Be sure to check back soon.
