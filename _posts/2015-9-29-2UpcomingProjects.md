Hey all, I've got 2 exciting projects planned for my portfolio! The first, a redesign of MyCourses, the primary online course management software used here at RIT. MyCourses, at least the RIT version is not fun to use. It's got a wealth of useless information, widgets and panels. I could write a 2,000 word paper on everything that's wrong with RIT's customized MyCourses. However, that would result in me bashing the site. I don't aim to vent, I aim to provide some solid constructive criticism that will hopefully make it to the people that manage the RIT MyCourses front end.

Instead of doing a plain ol' redesign, I'm going to try and emulate industry practices in taking this from concept to full blown hi-fidelity prototype. Here are the steps I will be taking (tentative):

<ol class="readable">
  <li>Usability testing for current site (maybe have friends outside RIT test)</li>
  <li>Lo-fidelity prototypes (wireframes/sketches) in either Balsamiq or AxureRP</li>
  <li>Design the UI using Sketch</li>
  <li>Hi-fidelity prototype using Pixate or InVision</li>
</ol>

Once the initial hi-fidelity prototype is complete I would conduct more usertesting, perhaps this time with people that are more familiar with RIT MyCourses. Throughout this process I would document <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>. I am very excited and have already gotten started with step 1. I'll be posting more soon!

The second project idea I had is quite different. The idea of revamping the interface of an existing, tangible product enticed me. One day, I happened to notice my girlfriend playing with the settings on her iPV D2 e-cig or, vape. Her particular vape has a very small screen similar to the old SanDisk mp3 players that displays four different things: current power output, temperature control, atomizer resistance, and current battery level. It can also display temperature. That's a lot of information to display on a screen about an inch in diameter. Additionally there are three unlabeled buttons for interacting with settings.

It's actually very hard to figure out without an instruction manual and especially hard for someone like me who knows absolutely nothing about e-cigs/vapes.

This kind of project is a bit of a venture away from my comfort zone. I don't know how to design things that aren't apps or websites but why should that stop me? I'll be having a lot of fun with this one.
