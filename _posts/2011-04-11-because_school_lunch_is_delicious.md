From [NewsChicago.com](http://newschicago.net/tag/little-village-academy/):

<blockquote>
To encourage healthful eating, some Chicago schools don’t allow kids to bring lunches or certain snacks from home — and some parents, and many students, aren’t fans of the policy

Of course, what they mean by certain snacks is that if a particular student has a food allergy or other medical condition, then that student can bring food from home.

I like this quote from the school principal Elsa Carmona:

<blockquote>
to protect students from their own unhealthful food choices
</blockquote>

I think it’s more like this:

<blockquote>
to protect students from their own…choices
</blockquote>

Ah, yes, public school food. I remember high school and before. It was the most nutritious, delicious, and inexpensive food ever, right? That’s sarcasm, of course.

We were lucky if the food was cooked all the way. Plus, it was against the rules to complain. I remember buying breadsticks once - still frozen in the middle. And the wait? Well, we had a half-hour for lunch. Some students waited in line for a half-hour or more for their lunch. Schools were never the greatest on that whole logistics thing (the administrators probably don’t even know what that word means). Hell, my little brother’s school once ran out of food during lunch.

Needless to say, I packed my lunch the vast majority of the time.

Do you have any school lunch horror stories?

Until next time
