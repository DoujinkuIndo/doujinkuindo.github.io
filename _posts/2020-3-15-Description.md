# [Permissions](#permissions)

### Write to external storage permission

Calibre Sync requires access to device storage for downloading books to device.

# [OneDrive integration](#onedrive-integration)
These are known issues with OneDrive integration
1. Only **OneDrive for Personal accounts** are supported. 
Also, only a single account OneDrive account is supported for now. 
That means you cannot switch to another OneDrive account.
However, you might have multiple libraries in a single OneDrive account.
2. If you are facing sign-in issues with OneDrive or you can't get past Progress bar while trying to add a library, 
please terminate the app by opening Recent Applications screen on your device and try again.
3. In case your calibre library folder on OneDrive is not detected please retry. 
In case of an exception reported on the screen, please send us an email.

# [FAQs](#faqs)
## Which cloud services are supported?

*   Google Drive
*   [Microsoft OneDrive](#onedrive-integration)
*   Dropbox

## Can I read my downloaded books with Calibre Sync?

No. Calibre Sync is **not a reader** app. There are already many beautifully functional reading application on Play Store that support a multitude of formats & features. Google Drive comes pre-integrated with most android phones and it has an integrated PDF reader. Same goes with Dropbox android application too. Calibre Sync launches any of these apps for you when you try to open a book through Calibre Sync.

## Downloading multiple books at once?

There is currently no support for downloading multiple books at once because the intent of the application is to browse your library but download books only on demand when you need them. The device storage is constrained. Keeping all your books on device defeats the purpose of cloud integration. This is what we feel; though if there are enough demands for such a feature, we might go ahead with the implementation.

## How can I use multiple Dropbox accounts?

Logout from the current Dropbox account using 'Sign Out' at top right, then log in with other account.

## SD card support?

Not yet! That is still under development.

## Other Cloud storage service

Amazon Cloud Drive is in the roadmap.

## Should I worry that my desktop Calibre libraries are corrupted by this app

No. Calibre Sync only perform READ-ONLY operation.

## I moved my library to different location (still in Cloud Drive), what should I do?

Please delete the current library in Calibre Sync and add directory back again.
