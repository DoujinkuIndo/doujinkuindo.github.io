title: Setup an Okta Developer Account for Testing
---

In this post we learn how to create an Okta developer account that can be used to test various Okta workflows and integrations.

## Setting up the Dev Account

1. Go to https://developer.okta.com
2. Click on the [Sign Up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) button in the top-right
3. Fill in the required account info.
4. Login to your email account to respond to the activation message. The subject of the email message should be similar to **Welcome to your Okta developer account**
5. Set a password for your new Okta Dev Account
6. Once logged in, go ahead and copy the URL. This is important because it contains your dev organization ID, and you will need this info to get back to your Okta portal.
