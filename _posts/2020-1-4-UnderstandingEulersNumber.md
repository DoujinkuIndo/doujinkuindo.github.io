Before one dives into the deep recesses of neural networks, it will benefit to take a good look at a peculiar number - Euler’s number (_e_ ≃ 2.71828...). Also called ‘exponential constant’, it is largely used in infinitesimal calculus - a tool relied upon by all engineering sciences and now hugely employed in Deep learning principles as well. 

Interestingly, though the constant is attributed to Euler - a versatile mathematician of 18th century who made major contributions in various fields from calculus, trignometry, physics to even music, it was Bernoulli that originally stumbled upon this number. Jacob Bernoulli was working on compounding principle when he noticed that when a dollar($1) with a 100% annual interest is compounded yields higher and higher as the frequency is increased, but that it approximates to a certain value between 2.69 and 3.
