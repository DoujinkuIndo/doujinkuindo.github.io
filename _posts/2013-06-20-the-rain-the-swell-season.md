# The Rain-- The Swell Season

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HaVNBEYVyw A highway song if I ever heard one. I came across this song about a month before a spring break driving adventure. I was dropping my roommate off in Ohio and driving from Columbus to Chicago by myself, and I could not freaking wait, because from the first time I heard this song, all I wanted was to blast it on the highway in Indiana with my windows down and fields as far as I could see. I had a rough winter, and the thought of yelling “Okay, I’m not what I promised you I would become” over that one deep chord became a solid thing to look forward to. I’m a nightmare to be around when a new song grabs me because I listen to it on repeat and force everyone around me to do the same. It doesn’t happen all that often that the repeat phase sticks around for more than a day or two, but this one lasted. I think it’s because The Rain, like most of Glen Hansard’s music, isn’t gimmicky. Even when it gets strings-y and heavily harmonized, it has a simple drive that’s impossible not to give in to because it feels like it’s literally inside of you, moving you forward. It’s universal without being vague. I can’t picture a time in my life when this song wouldn’t feel applicable. It’s equal parts joyful and fuck you and let it be; what more is there?
