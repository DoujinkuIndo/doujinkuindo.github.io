We had three great speakers from Logical Clocks, Contino, and StackRox at the March Cloud Native London virtual meetup, joining us via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams.

We are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [UMATR.](https://www.umatr.io/) for your generous and ongoing support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Our first speaker for the night was Jim Dowling from Logical Clocks, kicking us off for the evening Building Hopsworks, a cloud-native managed feature store for machine learning (starting at [30:37](https://youtu.be/9yUHJ5So6Rs?t=1837)). His takeaways are to:

* Feature Stores are a key platform for putting ML in production.
* We will describe our journey bringing Hopsworks from an on-premises platform to a cloud-native managed service.
* We will talk about HopsFS and how we built a HDFS-compatible file system over object storage (S3 and ADLS)

Next up was Josh Armitag from Contino discussing BDD + Modules = Your Best DevSecOps Life (starting at [1:01:08](https://youtu.be/9yUHJ5So6Rs?t=3668)). He talked about how:

* BDD is about communication not testing
* Modules should be deep not wide
* Setting up compliance at scale is simpler than you think

Finally, after our break we returned with Steve Giguere from StackRox who talked about Lay3r C8ke - Deterministic Security (starting at [1:45:43](https://youtu.be/9yUHJ5So6Rs?t=6343)). His takeaways mentioned:

* Shift left is hard work and that difficulty scales as you do
* Providing kubernetes context WILL help you prioritise vulnerable images
* Everything as Code is great but new/old security methods for code still apply
