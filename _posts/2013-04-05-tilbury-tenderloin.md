# Tenderloin — Tilbury

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnwOvjYOepk A story, and I don't know. I can't know. I think they're from Iceland; all the documentation is translated badly — it's based on a short story named _Tilbury_, perhaps? By an author named Þórarinn Eldjárn. Perhaps the video elucidates; I know the song has content and confessional tones, I know the song is light alt-rock; I know the song drifts and shivers and shimmies between being light and dark, his voice is gorgeous and surreal; the song marches along restlessly; the strings and synths are beautiful and the bass is steady; I don't know what it means, and it doesn't matter. I know the end comes too soon.
