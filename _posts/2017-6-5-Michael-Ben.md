The first Cloud Native London meetup went smoothly, with [Michael Hausenblas](https://twitter.com/mhausenblas) and [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/Ben_Hall) speaking on "What does Cloud Native mean (to you?)" and "The challenges of becoming cloud-native" respectively.

There was great positive feedback about:

* My opening intro on why I founded the group and the four topics I want to hear about ([slides available here]({{site.baseurl}}/Cloud-Native-London-July-2017)).
* Michael's discussion on the philosophy of Cloud Native.
* Ben's lightning demos on how Kubernetes, Istio, Prometheus and more.
* The sliders, pastries and sandwiches. Since I'm choosing the food, I get to pick interesting food!

Thanks to our sponsors, StorageOS, Sainsbury's, the CNCF and Tecknuovo. Looking forward to [the next event in August](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London/events/240108222/) already!
