The first Cloud Native London meetup went smoothly, with [Michael Hausenblas](https://twitter.com/mhausenblas) and [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/Ben_Hall) speaking on "What does Cloud Native mean (to you?)" and "The challenges of becoming cloud-native" respectively.

Lots of people said they appreciated my opening talk giving context about why I founded the group and what I hope to see [slides available here]({{site.baseurl}}/Cloud-Native-London-July-2017), Michael's discussion on the philosophy of Cloud Native, Ben's lightning demos on how Kubernetes, Istio, Prometheus and more, and the sliders and sandwiches.

Thanks to our sponsors, StorageOS, Sainsbury's, the CNCF and Tecknuovo. Looking forward to [the next event in August](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London/events/240108222/) already!
