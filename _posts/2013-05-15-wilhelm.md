# The Wilhelm Scream — James Blake

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isIABK-0ohQ James Blake is a mountain, an island, simple and natural and isolated, untraceable in influences and uninterpreted in meaning; pure and electronic and subtle, evocative - but what of? - and an absolutely impossible musician to relate to. If you like him, too bad, I don't know who else sounds like him. He's blue-eyed soul, he's ambient techno, he's neoclassical, he's dramatic and flamboyant and very quiet, an indie darling and a quiet, reclusive mixer of sound, like Imogen Heap. And this song, the first of his that ever came to fruition and popularity, an unlikely single with a slow, dark, horrid build, like Ben Frost, a build to nothing at all. Hold on.
