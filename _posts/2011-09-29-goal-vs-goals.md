Min Zhao, an assistant professor of marketing, has this to say:>If you have only one goal it puts you in a more action-oriented mindset and helps you save more ... Too much thinking about which goal is more important keeps people from acting. via [Rotman School of Management](http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/news/detail.asp?ID=615).
