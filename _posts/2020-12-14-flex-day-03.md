## 1. Week 15 Prep
Last week! All eyes should be on Friday, unless:
- you have a presentation this week (great practice for Finals).
- you still need Skulls. They can overlap with your presentation or the WBDV program (Friday website or fancy things for next semester).

Tony could use some help with the show on Friday:
- If we use `sait-wbdv.github.io`, we'd have to make the program website Private (or move it).
- OBS overlay needed.
- Finals website needed.
- Showcase website needed.
- Sound effects, soundtrack and other pomp and circumstance!

### Friday Finals Checklist
1. Profile consistency
    - Decide on the social sites you will be using for your professional work.
    - Pick an avatar (i.e. profile pic) and use it on all your these socials: GitHub, Codepen, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
    - When possible, cross link your socials. For example: fill out "Profile Links" in your Codepen Profile. 
2. GitHub 
    - Repo cleaning: Set any unneeded repos to Private.
    - Repo polish: Comment and refactor any repos that stay public.
    - Repo naming: Rename past assignments that will remain public. For example: `cpnt260-a2` -> `team-card` or similar.
3. Personal/Porfolio website
    - What will you use for your primary website?
    - Will you use a custom domain?
    - What is your goal for 2021? Find a practicum? Find a contract? Focus on more learning with an eye for paying projects?
4. Friday Presentation
    - Will you present individually (5 mins) or as a group (10 mins)?
    - Who is the target audience for your presentation? Remember, presentations will be recorded and publicized to potential employers. You also receive a copy for your own uses.
    - What will be your primary message to your audience?
        - I've got a great eye for design. Check out this colour and form!
        - I've been a coder for just 4 months. Here's an example of how I solve difficult problems.
        - Look at how I learned can learn something not covered in class! 
        - Here's an example of how I've collaborated in a team.
        - Check out how DRY this code is!
        - My idea is awesome (with supporting evidence)!

You've worked hard this semester. Friday let's keep Friday fun, although kinda terrifying.
