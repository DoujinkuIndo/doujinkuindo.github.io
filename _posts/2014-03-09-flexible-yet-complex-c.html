<p>I never really learn how to understand C++ language and how the compiler compiles C++ source code even though I've been using this language for such a long time. Until now I finally determine to try my best to understand it and see how much I could inspect into C++. Not too far after I've gone, I found it almost impossible to fully grasp a language with such complicated design.</p>
<p>C++ was created to provide large-scope programming ability to origin C language with a package of newly emerged features back when it was created. At that time, when memory was still too expensive, CPU was still slow enough to make you cry, and C became almost most popular language in the world, C++ needs to designed with compatibility with C, and as low level as it can.  However, people don't really care the efficiency of program too much today, comparing to programmer's effectiveness. That's why Java, Python were created. So the C++, as an ancient language of which large part focused on the hardware effectiveness, falls into an awkward situation.  And the way out is obvious for C++ community. A lot of efforts have been done by the community try to catch up on syntax's compactness with Python, Perl or even functional language (C++ does support lambda in latest standard.) and hide more trivial under cover though it causes a significant performance loss. </p>
<p>But due to some obscure design at the first place, I have to say, C++ is still very hard to understand. Maybe I should stop here today and make a list of C++ language pitfalls when my schedule is not tight. </p>
