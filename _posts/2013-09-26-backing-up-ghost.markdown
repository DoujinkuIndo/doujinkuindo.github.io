Hi Everybody, since I supported Ghost, I'm proud to own a bloggin system made by them.

The cool thing about this is that is all made in [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/) and some SQL database in this case is [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/)

I've tried a few a few blogging systems, using Joomla, Wordpress, Mambo, Concrete 5, Nesta, Jekyll and others, but this feels so right because is solely created for blogging. Besides what I tried and only like to do is blog about things that might be interest to me and maybe to the general public.

In any case, hopefully I can continue blogging and start working on my documentation.
If you want to see my name you can search it here: [Ghost launch](http://blog.ghost.org/launch/) - then do CNTR+F and search for `Enrique Valenzuela`

Take care and enjoy.
