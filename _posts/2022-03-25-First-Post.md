Welcome to my blog! This is the first post that I have created for my blog, so essentially this post is going to be an experimental work where I test out the features of this environment and try to haphazardly justify my need to have a blog.

The first thing that I want to check is my ability to add a formula:

\[E = mc^2\]

Awesome it appears that that worked correctly.

The next thing to check is whether I can add code

```c++
int main(int argc, char** argv) 
{
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Alright that appeared to be successful too!

Now finally lets try to add an image:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-logo.png)
