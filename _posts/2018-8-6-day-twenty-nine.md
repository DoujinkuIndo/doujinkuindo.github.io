After a reccomendation from Dr. G, I looked again at running `dolphot` without running `wfc3mask` on the drc images. There's still a few troubling things, and I'm actually getting the same result that I was before, but it's not as bad as I thought at first. 

# `dolphot`
If you try to run `dolphot` with the pure drc image as reference, you get the error "Number of extensions are not the same" and the program fails. You can still run `splitgroups` on just the drc image without doing `wfc3mask` -- which is where the problem truly lies -- but this only 3/4 works. You get this:

It looks like `splitgroups` works for the first three extensions and not the fourth. Looking in the working directory, the file 'ib2o01020_drc.chip4.fits' is only 96 KB, as opposed to the other three at 130,003 KB. I'm troubled by this, but it turns out it's not fatal like I thought it was before. I ended up using 'ib2o01020_drc.chip1.fits' as the reference image (all the chips are the same dimensions take up the same space on my SSD, so I don't think it matters which I use) and ran `dolphot`. These are exactly the same conditions I used the first time I ran `dolphot`, and that time when I checked the task manager I saw that the Ubuntu terminal wasn't using any processor or memory. I figured this meant that dolphot wasn't working, but I failed to scroll down a little bit and look in "Background Processes," not just "Apps". Turns out, dolphot is running in the background and taking up about 30% of my CPU and almost 2GB of RAM. It does stop at the same point it did before, but I was more patient this time around and it moved past that part. At the time of writing this, dolphot has already computed the alignment from the WCS in the header and found 343 stars to use for alignment. It's now on the "Finding Stars" step for photometry, but hasn't found anything yet. 

So, I made a dumb mistake. I knew that dolphot was going to take a while to run and left my laptop on and plugged in for a few hours. Stupidly, I forgot to set the screen to go to sleep "never". The laptop is already set to never turn off when plugged in, but it goes to sleep after 30 minutes, and that means it stops running background programs like dolphot (bright side: I didn't lose any progress). I was expecting dolphot to be done by now -- it's not even close. I'll look through the sections in the [dolphot manual](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/dolphot_userguide.pdf) about dolphot's output to pass the time. 

I took some notes on _ยง5.3 DOLPHOT Output_ because it's a little wordy and I wanted something that's easy to look at and will just tell you what's going on in the output:

DOLPHOT's Output: 'output.phot'
---
- Another file, 'output.phot.columns' tells what each column means 
- First thing in the file:
  - Goodness of fit values: ฯ, signal:noise ratio, sharpness, roundness, major axis, object type
    - Source-by-source after astrometric matching using all images
- Next thing: Photometry blocks (one per image)
  - In each block
    - First thing: Goodness of fit values (still source-by-source, now unique to each image)
    - Next things: Counts, background, count rate, count rate uncertainty, magnitude, magnitude uncertainty, FWHM, PSF ellipticity, PSF parameters a,b, and c, error flag
      - might also contain: VEGAMAG
  
DOLPHOT's Output: other files
---
- 'output.info' 
  - General info including list of photometry blocks, image alignment, aperture corrections   
- 'output.res.fits' and 'output.psf.fits'   
  - Background subtracted images and images of the PSF, one each per input image    
- 'output.apcor' and 'output.psfs'
  - Used for troubleshooting

There are also .warnings and .align files generated by dolphot that the manual doesn't talk about. I can guess what they do. The manual also talks more specifically about how to use all of the values I talk about above, but that's actually good to leave in the manual; it'd complicated these simple notes.  

Quick update on dolphot progress: It's found 563,657 stars in the image and elimanted ~100,000 of those due to badness I'm guessing. It also is talking about "PSF Stars" and "Neighbors" -- not really sure what that means. But, yay! Progress!

I also looked back at the [WFC3 Module Manual](http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/dolphotWFC3.pdf) and read its section on dolphot's output.
