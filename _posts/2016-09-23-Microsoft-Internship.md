title: Microsoft Summer Internship in Oslo
---

Today is the last day of my summer internship at Microsoft.
During the last 12 weeks, I met an insane amount of very interesting and intriguing people
from all parts of the world.

Microsoft Developer Center Norway (previously FAST Search & Transfer, acquired in 2008)
is a diverse group of talented and resourceful people that love what they do.
This summer, I helped out with Continuous Delivery of the Search technology,
developing an internal tool for better monitoring and quicker issue response.

Apart from the actual work, I got to explore Oslo,
took a week long solo trip across South Norway,
travelled together with the other interns for a Europe-wide Microsoft Internship Event to Dublin,
got to know Norway and Norwegians as a society and had fun doing it!

Take a short photo-tour of my trip through Stavanger, Preikestolen (Lysefjord), Hardangerfjord & Hardangervidda,
Bergen and Flåm:

Lubka and Juraj visited during their Scandinavian tour and we went to see the city.

At the end of August, Microsoft flew all the interns in Europe to Dublin for a weekend of free beer,
team-building events and Dublin nightlife. I really enjoyed the bar atmosphere in Dublin (The Porterhouse!)
and had lots of fun meeting other like-minded people from all over Europe.

Silvia came to visit and we rented a car and went to see Gaustatoppen with Anca and Matei.

While Zuzka came to visit in September, we had a hackathon at work.
Me and Jonas designed and implemented a tool to load balance
[Oslo's City Bike](https://oslobysykkel.no/en) stations for greater availability.

For the rest of my internship, I tried to finish up and hand over any remaining work
and hand over what I built, explore the remaining coffee places I wanted to and
worked on my school project.

One of the things I regret is that I didn't have enough time and/or will power to finish
my individual software project at school, so I'll probably have to finish it next semester.
My third year at [Matfyz](http://mff.cuni.cz) starts in bit more than a week.

I really enjoyed this summer - it was a wonderful new experience, at Microsoft and outside it.
The best part were definitely my wonderful colleagues - the culture and coherency at FAST
was exhilarating and I wish them all the best while facing new challenges in the future.
Especially, I want to thank my team, my buddy Grant and my manager Manolis for the extensive
help, support and knowledge they gave me during my short stay.

Thanks for the amazing summer!
