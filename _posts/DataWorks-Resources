We're excited to have you here at DataWorks!  Before you dive into your work, take a moment to tell us about your team.  [Fill out this brief survey.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cmuESnpiKnIHegGq0n97hfiNUMfCBI7MqcG5fuRLmDQ/viewform).  This will make it easier for us to keep track of teams throughout the day.

Delaware's Government Information Center put together this extremely helpful list of [data sources and resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1apitTenAxfrmVVg5wVKaSph6LOx97iP_ClFEaRiE9oc/edit#gid=1238956174).  This is a great starting point for each of the challenges that have been given.  If you need a brief description of each of the challenges, take a look [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16GB56fnu5EW-_kRKwA7Pqj3pBXBHzlj4cMnO61fz32Q/edit).  If you have questions about any of the challenges or where to find resources, let one of the organizers know and they'll be happy to help!
