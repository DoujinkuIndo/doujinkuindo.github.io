Though it has been a long time since the original posts about decolonization, positionality, power and identity on this blog, there is some additional research to share.
The original blog postst were written in 2017, a time that many of us remember for the consciousness raising protest movements of the time: Black Lives Matter (BLM), and equally important, Rhodes Must Fall (RMF).

RMF especially left very deep marks on the academic power and knowledge centers of the British colonial apparatus at University College London and at Cambridge especially.
In the time afterward, a decorative window celebrating R A Fisher and one of his most influential contributions to science: the Latin Square (and, in extension the Null Hypothesis that proves significant difference), was [taken down](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/27/cambridge-gonville-caius-college-eugenicist-window-ronald-fisher) from the dining hall of R A Fisher's old College.
This was done to respond to requests by activists to reckon with the University's historical involvement in the proliferation of Eugnenics research and colonial worldview.

At the time, I was very happy to hear about this. 
Apparently even, the activists used some of the posts on this blog as research material to ground their demands on.
That said, the intervening years have helped me to see more conplexity in the situation.
Obviously, the time of pure cancel-culture are past and symbolic actions are not as valuable as they were at the time (and often have proved to be only symbolic actions, not connected to a true tranformative force).
These are both, very aesthetically beautiful windows, and the impact that rigorous experimental design and scientific thinking have had on western culture and academic practice is immense.

That said, another narrative that has emerged in reaction to these events, and to other similar calls for better inclusivity in higher education, more contextual history of science education and support for rethinking significant difference as the basis of scientific knowledge creation.
This narrative, exemplified by [this article](https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/march-2021/cancelled-by-his-college) in thecritic.co.uk, makes the decision to take away references to Fisher as hasty and uninformed based only on hearsay on social media.
This point obviously has some merit and, again, typifies why we no longer see in 2023 the same kind of cancel-culture media storms that we saw in 2021.
Every story is always more complex.

R A Fisher had a long, rich life and over and above his massive scientific accomplishments there are many examples of his engagement in pro-social projects from UN writing, to expanding university education across the commonwealth. 
His support of the Indian Statistical Institute is well known, as is the fact that he supervised students and kept correspondence with academics from across the commonwealth in India, Ghana and more.
In light of these contrasts, I was contacted about a year and a half ago by a journalist that was reporting a story for the Economist following up on the removed Fisher Window and trying to trace the source of the claims issued in the decision that "He was a prominent proponent of eugenics, both in his scientific work and his public pronouncements throughout his career." 
Since my blog was mentioned in the demands that were sent to Cambdridge, she wanted to see if I had any direct source quotes that would back up the claim of his racism, or whether this was just fabricated based on what is assumed of anyone who is the Galton Eugenics Chair at University College London.
I think she and her editors hoped to not find any direct quotes that show his outdated views of race, evolution and eugenics so that then they could publish a scathing piece about hysterical cancel culture mobs that rewrite history to serve their preconceptions.

So, here follows some quotes and interpretation from Fisher's Magnum Opus on science, eugenics, philosophy and political economy: "The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection" that I put together to answer the journalist from the Economist about whether R A Fisher should be considered racist in our modern eyes. 

My interpretation is based on understanding that R A Fisher, ultimately, was a man of his time.
He came from a British Empire drunk on its own power and the power of the academic-colonial-industrial complex to continue generating massive amounts of wealth for the Empire, and by extension all of Europe.
He saw the expansion of cartographic and scientific exploration and trade to all corners of the world based on the mathematics of understanding tides, winds and navigation and based on the application of probability in insurance which enabled more and more ships to get funding to sail.
He saw the efficiency gains in industry as scientists learned more about chemistry, physics and economics, and he formalized the experiment as the atomic unit of this type of scientific research.
He saw all the land around the world, ready for farming, mining or industry and, in his eyes, not being efficiently utilized by the people that lived there.
He, like so many of his academic colleagues in eugenics and elsewhere saw no limit to the scientific progress that could be made, enabled by the tools of peer-review, scientific experimentation, and colonial wealth generation.
When one reads his writings, his utopian, optimistic vision for the world is striking, and as a member of the educated class of the British Empire, he clearly felt a responsibility to work hard to form the future as he thought best.
This is the very definition of "The White Man's Burden", with everything racist, outdated and naive that this concept entails.

The first chapters of this influential book discuss inheritance, genetic variation and population genetics on a theoretical and experimental level.
They talk about how evolution and natural selection follow from inheritance of mutations that make populations more or less fit to survive in a given environment.
He formalizes explanations of concepts that are still extremely important in evolutionary biology such as Fisherian Runaway, which is an explanation of how sexual selection could create unintuitive evolutionary results such as peacocks ostentatious and expensive Male feathers.
They are based on sound observational, formalized mathematical, and experimental data, and have every reason to be celebrated as thought provoking advances to the status quo of evolutionary biology.

However, from Chapter 8 onwards, his discussions take a more general philosophical view on human evolution and how natural selection is applicable to the strange colonial world he found himself in.
He saw the varied conditions of human life around the world and the varied customs and concluded that genetic material defined the differences in human culture.
Furthermore, especially strange from our modern evolutionary perspective, he concluded that civilization was the result of human evolution and could be explained in terms of desireable genetic material being naturally selected for in a progression that he saw as going from Savage to Barbarian, to Proletariat to Aristocrat.
This arc was what he was trying to define from a "scientific", evolutionary biology perspective, and is worth examining in further detail.

First he discusses what defines high genetic value in a society, namely civilization and industrialization.
The following passage clearly shows the scope of his endorsement of British colonial supremacy as an unquestionable good for the world and for all peoples who become civilized by it.

> The specialization of occupations, involving the customary acceptance of a conventional standard of exchange, the maintenance of public order, and the national organization of military preparations, are thus the universal characteristics of the civilized in contradistinction to the uncivilized societies of mankind. 
> It is a matter of experience, which no one thinks of denying, that such an organization does in fact enable a given area to support a much larger population, and that at a higher level of material and intellectual well-being, than the uncivilized peoples who could alternatively occupy the same territory. 
> --P.174

He then goes on to discuss what could cause an increase in genetic fitness: namely war, competition and colonialism.

> Among a group of small independent competing tribes the elimination of tribes containing an undue proportion of the socially incompetent, and their replacement by branches of the more successful tribes, may serve materially to maintain the average standard of competence appropriate to that state of society. 
> --P.182

And this is tied into his vision that the British empire is materially increasing the average well-being in the world, even being a large net positive for colonially subjected countries such as India and China:

> Of the eastern civilizations of India and China we are, unfortunately, not in a position to produce satisfactory statistical evidence. 
> In the absence of European administration, the tremendous mortality among the poorest class in these countries occasioned by war, pestilence, and famine, must constitute a factor of great importance, and one that might arrest the progress of racial deterioration, though at a somewhat low level, if the conditions were otherwise similar to those observed in the West. 
> The prolonged phase of stagnation and lack of enterprise, from which both these peoples suffered before the impact of European ideas, is at least suggestive of an equilibrium produced by these means. 
> --P.222

Overall however, the prevailing theory in these last few chapters is something which might be called a "hyper-racialized" of the view of human civilization which classifies and ranks people from highest to lowest genetic value as distinct races. 
This is due to his view of the high "intensity" of natural selection of genetic fitness via reproduction which he says creates distinct genetic groups very rapidly. 
This is an unscientific claim viewed through today's eyes, since we know that there is little genetic distinction between human groups around the world. 
However, this claim is what underlies his whole theory of the decline of civilisation, where low genetic value peoples multiply with higher intensity than high genetic value people and thus decrease the fitness of the civilisation. 
This is exemplified by the summary on page 226.

Firstly, he ranks rich, upper class people as having the highest genetic value, (clearly due to the perfect process of economic selection which means that rich people have been selected as those that provide highest value to society).

> The different occupations of man in society are distinguished economically by the differences in the rewards which they procure. 
> Biologically they are of importance in insensibly controlling mate selection, through the influences of prevailing opinion, mutual interest, and the opportunities for social intercourse, which they afford. 
> Social classes thus become genetically differentiated, like local varieties of a species, though the differentiation is determined, not primarily by differences from class to class in selection, but by the agencies controlling social promotion or demotion. 
> --P.226

Poor people are a different "race" because they have been selected for by their parents inability to provide value to society and their inability to provide value to society. 
Thus also, charity messes with this process as it helps people out who would otherwise have died off, and thus is only beneficial because of the moral argument that maybe people with better genetic potential can be accidentally poor (due to genetic variation). 
This would mean that an imperative of education is to sort children into the good and bad genetic potential categories who are therefore worthy and unworthy of help. 
(See especially his writing on [Eugenics and Education]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/fisher_eugenics_and_education.pdf) which is some fascinating chilling reading combing eugenics views of class, disability and intellectual ability...)

> Those, on the contrary, who fail most completely to perform socially advantageous actions have the least claim upon the wealth and amenities of the community. 
> In theory they may perish of starvation, or may become indebted up to the amount of the entire potential services of the remainder of their lives, or of the lives of their children. 
> --P.183

> Charity, in the sense of the uneconomic relief of poverty, would evidently be a vicious weakness, although there would be some virtue in shrewdly backing for mutual advantage the capable, but accidentally unfortunate. 
> --P.184

However these are all British people who still clearly have higher genetic value than "barbarians" from whom, he argues, civilisations emerge, and much higher than "uncivilized peoples" who haven't even begun their ascent into civilisation, and so are lowest on the genetic value ladder. 
The civilisations Fisher classes into the "barbarian" categories all play into the narrative of racial value from the British colonial period (Nordic, Germanic, Arabic, Central Asian, etc.) and are credited with directly taking over from the Romans to be the forefathers of British civilisation:

> The state of society with which we are here concerned, which may be exemplified by the primitive peoples of Northern Europe, as represented in the Icelandic Sagas, in Tacitus' description of the Germans, and probably in the Homeric poems, by the pre-Islamic Bedouin of the Arabian desert, by many, if not all, of the Turkish and Tartar peoples of the Central Asiatic steppes, and by the Polynesians of New Zealand and Samoa, is characterized by a tribal organization, influenced, or indeed dominated, by the blood feud. 
> All these show a strong feeling for aristocratic or class distinction, and this character, as well as the blood feud, seems to be rather rare among uncivilized peoples generally. 
> For this reason it is convenient to designate this particular type of society by a special term, which shall contrast them with civilized, and distinguish them from the other uncivilized peoples. 
> We may conveniently call them barbarians. 
> This term is the more appropriate in that the examples given, few as they are, include the most important groups of peoples, who have, in the course of history, overrun the great centres of relatively permanent civilization, and to whom the existing organization of society can be traced back in historical continuity.
> --P.243

> Certain uncivilized peoples characterized by a tribal organization, the blood feud, and the importance attached to kinship and pedigree, exhibit a state of society in which the more eminent are certainly the more fertile, and in which the effects of Natural Selection are greatly enhanced by social and sexual selection. 
> The action of these factors is of particular importance in respect of the qualities recognized by man as socially valuable, which have, in this way, received a selective advantage very much greater than any which could be ascribed to the differential elimination of entire tribes. 
> The group of qualities understood by these barbarian peoples as associated with heroism has thus been developed considerably beyond the optimum of individual advantage. 
> The higher mental qualities of man, and especially his appreciation of them, seem to be ascribable to the social selection of this type of society. 
> --P.255

This clearly differentiates the barbarians, which he says have higher genetic value from the totally uncivilized "savages" found in other places. 
In fact, he defines in natural selection terms, how these peoples progress from being savage to becoming barbarians, namely through the introduction of land ownership, inheritance and capitalism.

> Amongst wholly savage peoples, although infanticide is not usually regarded as wrong, it is probably not practised more frequently than is on the whole racially advantageous. 
> If however, in the course of time, a people, with feelings in this matter appropriate to the condition of extreme savagery, came to be placed in conditions in which the accumulation of property is not only possible, but is the natural aim of the more ambitious, the temptation to infanticide will be more uniformly insistent, and the corresponding selection of the moral instincts which resist this temptation, will be correspondingly severe. 
> If we accept the view that all long civilized peoples have been purged of their more callous or murderous elements by passing through this period of severe selection, we shall be in a position to realize why it is that the consciences of civilized peoples, as expressed in their religious teaching, should so unhesitatingly condemn infanticide.
> --P.201

It would be absolutely ahistorical to not read this as including Sub Saharan Africa, the Americas and anywhere else that colonialism had a stake in dehumanising and displacing people for economic power gain. 
This needs to clearly be viewed though a modern racial context of black and white, and shows not only that R A Fisher was racist in a modern sense that he was predjudiced, but that he was racist in the dehumanising, detached, pseudo-scientific sense that defined early eugenics.
In his view, humanity wasn't one species, but instead was made up of many sub-species on varying degrees of the scale of evolution, aka civilisation.
When he wrote about exterminating tribes with lower genetic value to raise the overall global genetic fitness, he was justifying colonialism, genocide and ultimately giving credence to the same type of argumentation that led directly to the eugenics of the holocaust.
This picture is complex, but just because R A Fisher wasn't hateful towards people of color, or actively involved in the worst kinds of colonial exploitation like some of his contemporaries, doesn't excuse the world view he propogated or the implications of the research output he produced.

In the end, the Economist didn't publish their story, so I guess they understood that just because we aren't as deep in the throes of the cancel-culture moment, doesn't mean that they want to throw their whole brand behind the British colonial legacy. 
Wise choice, in my opinion.
