title: Owen Wagner ST_558 HW #1

I'm ocwagner and I'm a graduate student in NC State's Dept. of Agricultural Engineering. ST_558 is the final course in my degree and assuming all goes well, I'll graduate by the time I'm 40! Agriculture is becoming more data driven and I don't want to be left out of the conversation...
