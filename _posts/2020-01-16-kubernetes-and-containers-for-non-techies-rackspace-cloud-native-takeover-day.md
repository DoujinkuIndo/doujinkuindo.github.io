* Containers allows developers to precisely state what their services need and have the infrastructure hide any problems. Similar to booking flights and not having to worry if a mechanical fault means the aircraft is switched.

* Kubernetes isolates developers from each other. Like when you don't need to coordinate with hundreds of other people trying to book flights, you pretend that you are the only person in the world.

* Often developers are driving adoption, so you need to sell to developers. A good developer advocate should be able to communicate with and sell to a broad audience.
