Welcome all,

  Yes, its that time of year again and no I dont mean pumpkin spice everything and candy corn suddenly being desireable season.  I mean midterms and because of that I will try to keep this short and review what we have covered so far, been doing in class as well as the readings and look towards the evr looming final project.

The journey so far:

* We defined digital humanities as the use of digitl technologies to view and analyze traditional humanities or the creation of humanities through digital mediums (The Return of TGlavan).

* Following this we looked further into textual analysis exploring methods such as tf-idf (The TLDR on tf-idf and Shipping) and visual representations of text (Insert Clever Blog Name Here) to derive information without reading the full text or gain a deeper understanding of the construction of a text (A Large Amount of Difficulty Concerning Zip).

* In class this past week we covered networking and how chacters interact with eachother noting both the direction of and depth of the connection between characters. We then applied these methods to the Once Upon a Time pilot noting the direction of the dialogue between characters and their positions in scenes (methods-f16/once-data/).

  Looking forward
