title: World Design Summit 2017&#58; Designing the World (Part 1 of 2)
intro: I reflect on my favourite talks of the World Design Summit, my coincidental interactions with the attendees and speakers, mini-travelogues on my Montreal experience and my reflections about the philosophy of design as framed by Henk Oosterling’s Dasein as Design. What is the use of design today?

Walking down and enjoying the many colorful murals of the lively Boulevard Saint Laurent, I couldn’t imagine a better city than Montreal to host the inaugural World Design Summit. The entire trip was serendipitous, playing host to several happy coincidences. Montreal, the UNESCO City of Design, was also celebrating its 375th birthday that year.

The World Design Summit was ambitious in its aims, involving six disciplines of design: architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, graphic design, interior design and industrial design. It aspired to bring professionals, government officials and business leaders from all over the world to bring down their barriers and unite towards the common goal of how to use design to make a better future. The climax of the event was the signing of the Montreal Design Declaration which outlines concrete steps for designers to use as a resource for their own planning.
