  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started by writing the planning section</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>We needed to do the planning section as the classwork and the designing section for homework.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes because I completed the planning section in class to a decent standard (in my opinion).</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The only real strategy I used was referring back to the Scratch game to see what I had done, the controls, sprites etc to write about on the sheet. That method was fairly effective compared to just writing from memory but apart from that there wasn't much strategy I was just writing about what I had done or are intending to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was trying especially hard to focus but obviously there was the chat room incident which distracted me a bit but apart from that I think I was reasonably attentive and focused to what I was doing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I need to completely avoid any incidences such as the chat room because whilst I didn’t get a yellow card I was still part of it and it still got distracted so next time I need to be 100% focused on what I’m doing.</td>
