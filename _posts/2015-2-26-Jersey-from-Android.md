As usual, the Jersey Team is busy cranking out new releases. In February, the team has released [Jersey 2.16](https://github.com/jersey/jersey/releases/tag/2.16) and [Jersey 1.19](https://github.com/jersey/jersey-1.x/releases/tag/1.19) (see related [blog](https://blog.dejavu.sk/2015/02/13/jersey-1-19-is-released/)).

Jersey has a large, active and involved community. For example, there was a bug in Jersey when used on z/OS (who doesn't use Jersey on z/OS?). A community member raised this particular issue along with a suggested fix, fix which has been integrated in 2.16.

Jersey 2.16 is also solving some of the issues related to [running the Jersey client stack on Android](https://blogs.oracle.com/japod/jersey-2x-client-on-android). Supporting Android is more a side project and Jersey 2.16 clearly shows some initial success. But more work needs to be done. The Jersey Team is looking for concrete feedback on real uses-cases and why not, community contributions too.

So with 2.16, you can finally run a Jersey client on an Android phone connecting to a Jersey server running on Z/OS! Yeah!

And it's not because the Jersey community is already large and active that you cannot participate, contributions are always welcome! See here on the different ways to contribute to Jersey.
