title: API CollegeData
---
This is a study trying to predict what are the most important factors to determine the cost of college. I know, I am not that original and, I know, it seems obviuos but... You never know!!! Also, I just wanted to do some scraping and enjoy something I used to hate when I was 5: SOUP. I had to do a serious work (at least for me) digging and digging from the college data API and I came out with some interesting outcome.

## This is a brief description of this project.
  1. This is a project about BeatifulSoup and web scraping.
  2. It is interesting to find out how certains factors as seniority have an impact on it.
