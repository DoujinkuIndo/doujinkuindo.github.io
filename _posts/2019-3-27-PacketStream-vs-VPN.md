title: PacketStream vs VPN
---
Digital Privacy Needs To Be Convenient. Solutions like VPNs offer privacy at a big cost to convenience. That's where PacketStream comes in. <br><br>![Residential IPs]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/post_content/packetstream_vs_vpn.png)

Websites like Google don’t allow user to register accounts from “privacy” service IPs.

Ecommerce sites block Tor and VPN users from making online purchases.

Many sites deny access from shared IPs altogether. Current privacy services like VPNs simply do not offer a convenient solution.

This is where PacketStream is changing things. Our network is powered by our Packeters.

Every Packeter signs up to share their residential bandwidth with customers who are paying to get access.

This changes allows our customers to consume the internet as if they were browsing through their connection at home, except this time with added privacy.
