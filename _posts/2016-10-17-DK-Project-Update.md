I have decided to conduct my Digital Humanities research project by asking the following question: How does Internet usage impact the 
digital divide in South Korea? Because South Korea is famous for having the fastest average internet speed per capita, it is an especially
intriguing country to research further on.  In a recent United Nations e-government survey, using the E–Government Development Index, 
South Korea is ranked first with an index value of 0.9462. Indexes are measured out of 1, which indicates this as being a considerable 
score for the country overall. As a global leader in technological development, hosting the headquarters of LG , Samsung, and Hyundai, 
making it a fascinating and lucrative country to research.
 
Use of the Internet has become a prevalent characteristic of South Korean culture. In fact, ”Whether it be searching for information 
about travel, trading stocks, playing games, browsing entertainment websites, or shopping on-line for services and goods (or e-commerce),
South Koreans are among the most active users of these Internet activities each and every day.” (Rhee, 2004, “Intro”, para. 1). This 
appears to be an ongoing trend in the country. Internet usage is becoming a greater aspect  in the daily life of South Koreans, and, 
more gradually, worldwide.

Internet usage has a direct impact on the digital divide present in South Korea. The factors to consider when analyzing this include: 
“Other characteristics, such as age, educational level and perception of the benefits from Internet use proved to be significant factors
in Internet adoption as well. But income level (i.e., affordability) has no effect on Internet adoption because the Internet is easily 
accessible and widely available to the public in South Korea” (Rhee, 2004, “Conclusion”, para. 1). The population is most important when 
dealing with national impact. This leads to additional significance between the generations: “The Internet has proven particularly useful 
in civil society in the course of election campaigns and in mobilizing social movements where periodic social protests and demonstrations
in the streets of Seoul are not an uncommon occurrence. However, the disparity in Internet use has produced a widespread digital divide 
within the country itself. In particular, Internet use and non-use are clearly divided by generation, which leads some to warn of a new 
and widening generation gap” (Rhee, 2004, “Intro”, para. 1).

The article titled "The Adoption and Use of the Internet in South Korea" is only one of multiple recources I am currently investigating
to further develop my research project. I have to continue working on researching different articles, record and/or cite footage for my 
video, commentate over my findings, edit the clips, conduct sound editting, and complete the video artifact.
