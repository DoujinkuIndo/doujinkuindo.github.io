# Doctor Worm — They Might Be Giants

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkVHdUkMJdk This is a song of beginnings for me, purely by chance. _Severe Tire Damage_ is the first physical CD I ever actually owned, and this is the first song I recall enjoying so much that I'd go back, hit rewind and thrill in listening to it all over again (repeat a good seven or eight times). It's the song that came up first on shuffle as I rode the bus to the first day of high school; the song that came up when I first learned to drive a car. I still remember seeing this music video on _Ka-Blam! _at a very young age - vaguely recalling that some issue that was perturbing pint-sized me at the time was wholly decimated in the face of such a silly-yet-earnest song. So there's a special connection I have to this song that's remained through the years - it's like an old friend to me, and that feeling arises each and every time I hear it. It could've been _any_ song, really, but this is the one that kept coming back: a whimsical episode told with a straight face. If I have a spirit animal, I hope it's Rabbi Vole.
