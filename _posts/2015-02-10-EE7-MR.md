The Java EE 7 specification ([JSR 342](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342)) was finalised end of May 2013 and since then, various minors errors have been reported. Those will soon be addressed as the Java EE 7 specification will go through a maintenance release.

You can check a draft of the specification with the proposed changes incorporated [here](https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/).

Those proposed corrections should only impact the specification document itself and not the Reference Implementation nor the TCK. So once this MR will be done and voted, the version of the specification should be Java EE 7 Rev A.
