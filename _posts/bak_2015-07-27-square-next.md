New release shocker!

My second game, Square Next, is about to release on the Play Store!

It's an action puzzler where you need to complete the letter or number sequences within the time limit.

It's taken about 7 months to finish, which is probably ridiculous considering the original prototype was done in an evening, same as Nubbles. But it can be hard to find the time to work on these projects, as I have a full time job as well (boo). One of the main problems is flow, only working on the project in fairly random bursts after fairly random intervals means I can never get any kind of flow going. I can never remember where I'm up to (even though I always leave myself copious notes), so I tend to spend the first twenty minutes trying to remember what I did last, what's left to do, and why it doesn't compile.

At this point I have to admit I'm a bit fed up working on it, and it doesn't seem as fun as it did when I first had the idea and showed the prototype to a few friends. They all seemed to like it at the time, so I've forged ahead, and still plan to release. The original idea was to create something with a shorter cycle time than Nubbles, but even though the scope was smaller, it's still taken about the same length of time to finish.
