### Java Drill
Today we did the same drill questions again. Here are two questions that I was not very familiar with:
1. Join an array into a string=> this [link](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string-join) helped. I didn't get the 2nd method in this example(delimiter + elements)
2. Split a string into an array

### Git & command Line
A common issue I had when I dealt with command line was forgetting the commands. Tim shared a trick by recording commands before closing the window.
> ```history > ..\history.text(save it in the parent directory)```

### Java Tag: text response
1.a string variable with multiple methods: `String input.newLine().trim().length() + "" (empty string)`

### Trust 101
Today our team made three goals for entrusted behavior:

1. character: Talk straight
1. competence: Clarify expectations
1. both: Listen first
Tim suggested us to use the phrases in daily conversations to make it a habit. 

I tried "clarify expectations" and "listen first" on our individual working hour. My team members were all very supportive and we all practiced the skills together. We had a good start.
