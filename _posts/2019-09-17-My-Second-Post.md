## Learning Journal for September 17th

### Java Drill

### Git & command Line

### Java Tag: text response

### Trust 101
Today our team made three goals for entrusted behavior:
*character: Talk straight
*competence: Clarify expectations
*both: Listen first
Tim suggested us to use the phrases in daily conversations to make it a habit. I tried "clarify expectations" and "listen first" on our individual working hour. My team members were all very supportive.
