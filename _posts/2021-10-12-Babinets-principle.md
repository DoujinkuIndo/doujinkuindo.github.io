title: Babinet's principle, slot antennas and why does it matter for PCB design
---

Hello folks,I've been quite lazy lately, spending a lot of time on Netflix and useless stuff, like watching "A day in the life of (some profession)" on YouTube, just to regret spending 5, 10, 100 minutes gathering completely useless information, but dazzled just by the aesthetics of how these videos are done. 

Working from home has not been kind to me. I spend the whole day at the computer at home, at the end of the workday, I don't have the energy to turn on my computer and keep looking into stuff and delve into simulations and whatnot. I just want to move away from my office and slouch on the couch in front of the TV. Well, enough with the jibba jabba, this post is my resolve to get back at looking at useful stuff and creating structured content about things I deem worth to register and have available for future consultation, while at the same time share with others.

In this post, which I might split into two if it starts to become to long, I want to revise some material from Electromagnetics class, I'll even put some theory into it and then make a bridge on how this principle is applied to antenna design as well as it helps to explain phenomena that is relevant in the EMC (Electromagentic Compliance) field. I'm talking about the [Babinet's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babinet%27s_principle) applied to electromagnetics.
