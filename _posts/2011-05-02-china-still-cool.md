After 12 or so hours from Vancouver to Shanghai, I jumped on a domestic flight up to Xi&#8217;an to start this epic journey of mistranslations and mystery foods.

Day 1 got off to an interesting start, when I jumped in a cab armed with directions to my hostel only to find out the driver had no idea where I wanted to go because the address was in an english translation of what locals only understand in Chinese characters. After googling some more information I found an address in Chinese that the driver was confident he could get me to. Getting there in one piece was another story altogether; driving at speeds of up to 140 km/h while on the phone, darting in and out of lanes weaving traffic, and funnily enough the closest we came to an accident was driving down a back street at 5km/h whilst lost trying to look for the hostel.

Since this is the first of many* blogs to come from the next 2 months of travel I should probably introduce the main characters in the story. First up there is the handsome protagonist:

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>

Then there is the couple:

  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/asiaeurope11/IMG_4251-1.jpg"><img class=" " title="anna damo" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/asiaeurope11/IMG_4251-1.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="288" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    The little one is Anna, she's our interpreter. The tall one is Damien, and he is pretty cool.
  </p>
</div>

Last up is our quasi-american hombre, Dave Jasek:

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    ...but he hasn't even joined the trip yet, so forget about him for the moment.
  </p>
</div>

After a good night&#8217;s rest we spent the next day taking in the sights of the city, namely the city wall which Damien tells me is the largest in the world. I don&#8217;t really know, but I&#8217;m going to run with that. It&#8217;s about 13 or so kms around, and we rode all the way around that sucka.

</p>

Later in the day we went to visit the Wild Goose Pagoda with a massive water fountain out the front. Anna tried to wade through it, until a guard angrily kept blowing his whistle at her&#8230; he didn&#8217;t seem too impressed. Nice area to visit anyways.

</p>

Also for no reason at all, here&#8217;s Anna and I with the Eiffel Tower:
