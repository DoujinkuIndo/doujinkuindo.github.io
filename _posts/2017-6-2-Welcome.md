title: Hello world!

Welcome to Cheryl Hung's blog. I'm a developer advocate at [StorageOS](http://storageos.com), where I code, write and speak about storage, containers and cloud. I'm active in the developer community and speak at meetups related to Docker containers, Kubernetes, microservices, cloud native and more.

I founded the [Cloud Native London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London/), the official Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Meetup group dedicated to building a strong, open, diverse developer community around the Cloud Native platform and technologies in London.

I spent five years at Google working on backend teams across Google Maps, living in London and New York. I hold a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, King's College.

This blog is primarily but not exclusively technical/developer oriented, and you can get in touch via Twitter and LinkedIn.
