A common grumble I hear about the place is that the internet is too slow. While many things on the local LAN can affect this, the first port of call is to actually know what size pipe we have to the internet.

To determine this,
[Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/) is great. It shows with good use of eye candy how quick your upload and download speed is (or isn't).

Not only that but it identifies which ISP your using. A quick handy tool to use.
