title: Expired SSL certificate 
---

Seems we forgot to update our SSL certificate in time. This means our wiki and forum is not reachable for now.
We will work on the matter as soon as possible. In time, please use followed workaround:

* open a terminal
* enter followed line: **sudo date -s 2015-04-06 +09**

This will set back your system time to Mo 6. Apr 00:00:03 CEST 2015.

kind regards
Philip MÃ¼ller, Manjaro Development Team
