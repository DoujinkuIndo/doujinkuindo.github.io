title: Expired SSL certificate
---

Oops! We forgot to update our SSL certificate before it expired. This means you will get a warning in your web browser when you try to access our wiki or forum.

We are working on getting a new SSL certificate - please bear with us.

Until then, if you use Firefox you can try a 'private window' which may allow you to add an exception to ignore the expired certificate. You could also try a different web browser, as different browsers treat the issue in different ways.

If all else fails, you can set your clock back a few days:

* open a terminal
* enter followed line: **sudo date -s 2015-04-06 +09**

This will set back your system time to **Mo 6. Apr 00:00:03 CEST 2015**. Remember, this should only be used as a last resort, as it might cause issues!

Kind regards,
