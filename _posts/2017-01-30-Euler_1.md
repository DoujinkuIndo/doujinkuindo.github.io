["If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000"](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

One things to keep in mind for this problem is that there are certain multiples of 3 that are also multiples of 5, like 30. Therefore when going through and finding the multiples to add to the sum, we need to make sure we are not doubling into the calculation numbers like 30. All the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, are the multiples of 15. Therefore my approach will be to add up all the multiples of 3 and the multiples of 5 that are not multiples of 15.

My solution:

```Python  
def Euler1(a):    
    total = 0    
    x = 1    
    while x < a:    
        if x%3 == 0 or (x%5 == 0 and x%15 != 0):    
            total += x    
        x += 1    
    print(total)  
```

Looking at others' solutions, here are two that I really liked:

```Python
su  = 0    
for i in range(1000):    
      if i%3 == 0 or i%5==0:    
          su+=i    
print(su)    
```

```Python
print(sum(set(range(3,1000,3)) | set(range(5,1000,5))))    
```
