# More Than A Feeling — Boston

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSR6ZzjDZ94 Oh god, that word, 'classic'. I'd never really intently listened to the lyrics before; it was always just one of those songs I just _knew_ from experience; it was on Scrubs once, I heard it on the radio, it was part of my knowledge but never garnered my attention. I knew Boston was a band, I knew it was a great song, but... I don't know. There's a sweet spot for music, where it's not popular enough that you can just ignore it, but it's not totally off your radar. I love this song, I'd cheer for it on the radio, but I could never analyze it. It's an anthem hit, it's feel-good, but I wouldn't listen to it for comfort or advice. It's just... there.
