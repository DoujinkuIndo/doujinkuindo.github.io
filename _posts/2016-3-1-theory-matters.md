title: #theoryMatters in neuroscience?
---

- *What is the role of theory in neuroscience?*
- *How can theorists and experimentalists synergize better?*

To promote theoretical and computational neuroscience to the neuroscience community, I (Memming Park) have interviewed a number of neuroscientists with diverse background.
Most of these interviews took place at [COSYNE 2016](http://www.cosyne.org/c/index.php?title=Cosyne_16) main meeting (Salt lake city, Utah).

The videos were promoted on twitter with hashtag: **#theoryMatters**

Anne Churchland came up with the initial idea of making a promotional video, and I suggested interviewing COSYNE participants. CSHL has a related [blog post](http://labdish.cshl.edu/2016/02/25/if-you-thought-all-neuroscientists-work-with-neurons-youre-wrong/). I designed, filmed, and edited all interviews. This project is partially sponsored by COSYNE.
