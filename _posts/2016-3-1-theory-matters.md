title: #theoryMatters in neuroscience?
---

To promote theoretical and computational neuroscience, I have interviewed a number of neuroscientists with diverse background.
Most of these interviews took place at [COSYNE 2016](http://www.cosyne.org/c/index.php?title=Cosyne_16) main meeting (Salt lake city, Utah).

The videos were promoted twitter with hashtag: **#theoryMatters**

Anne Churchland came up with the initial idea of making a promotional video, and I suggested interviewing COSYNE participants. I filmed all interviews at COSYNE, and edited all footage. This project is partially sponsored by COSYNE.
