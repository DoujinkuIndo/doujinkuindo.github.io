# Sunrise — Shingo Suzuki

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZy0rBSscA Perspective — and I write this actively procrastinating a tricky CS125 assignment — is essential. This is why we celebrate, why we talk about our lives to other people, why we escape into fiction. All music is an international community, whether or not any particular genre likes to admit it. Hip-hop and rap are based especially upon _braggadocio_, which is unstable in a large perspective. Thus, world music is a distinct genre; international jazz and classical and even rock and pop are normal. But international hip-hop — hip-hop that admits there is a world outside the neighborhood in which it is made — is rare and often phenomenal. [Nujabes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnba1fKRNZo) gets his appeal from being multicultural, a Japanese dude who recorded with American rappers. French hip-hop, like the Shingo song above, serves the same purpose.
