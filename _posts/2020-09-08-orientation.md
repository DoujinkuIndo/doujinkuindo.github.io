You will be responsible for maintaining your development environment for each course in this program. The specific requirements will change from course to course but the following software will be required for the entire program.

## Messaging Apps
We will be predominantly using Slack as the preferred messaging tool for this program. You should see an invite to the SAIT WBDV Slack team sometime during orientation day.

- [Install Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/){:target="_blank"}

Note: The past two cohorts of this program also have access to this Slack team but each cohort has a private channel. Most of our communication will be in this channel but you're free to meet and interact with past students of this program. You may also use MS Teams if you'd like to avoid outside students. 

Your instructor also runs a public Discord server where you can find help:

- [Pixels YYC Discord Invite](https://discord.gg/9qZSrCG){:target="_blank"}

## Development Browsers
Regardless of which browser you prefer in your off-time, this course requires Firefox Developer for its superior (for the moment) CSS Dev Tools. Chrome can be optionally used for its Javascript Dev Tools in CPNT 262.

- [Install Firefox Developer Edition](https://nightly.mozilla.org/){:target="_blank"}
- [Why are there Four Firefoxes?](https://youtu.be/qQ1oQJJn1nQ){:target="_blank"}

The Mozilla Developer Network (the makers of Firefox) recently launched an entire [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh5UlGiu9d6LegIeUCW4N1w){:target="_blank"} to teach developers how to use Firefox Dev Tools.

## Code Editor
Most of your time in this course will be spent in your code editor of choice. If you haven't installed one yet, your instructor will be using VS Code (highly recommended).

- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download){:target="_blank"}

If you've been using one you like, stick with it, just as long as it doesn't get in the way of coding.The old industry favourite was [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3){:target="_blank"} and a few past WBDV grads loved [Brackets](http://brackets.io/){:target="_blank"}.

## Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"} will be a large component of this program starting Sept 15th with CPNT 201. We will use Git to manage, share and deploy our code. It is the defacto industry standard for source control.

- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git){:target="_blank"}

Unfortunately, the install page isn't very user friendly. If in doubt, both Mac and Windows users can install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. We will configure Git next week!

### GitHub
GitHub is a private corporation (now owned by Microsoft) that has built a world-leading community around Git. All sample code and projects will be hosted by GH and the program website is hosted using [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} if you haven't already. **Don't forget:** your GH username will be seen by potential employers.
2. _Watch_ and/or _Star_ the [program repository](https://github.com/sait-wbdv){:target="_blank"}.

## Homework
1. Read: [A Brief History of Print Design](https://blog.123rf.com/history-print-design/)
2. Watch: [11 Visual Hierarchy Principles](https://youtu.be/ZXItTIjC0Wk) by [Visme](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2isRzoZisjBS6PaGWTDV0Q) (many of their videos are about their proprietary presentation slide builder)
3. Find an example of print design in your immediate(ish) area (home, office, vehicle, etc) that you love, hate or wouldn't normally notice. You will be discussing your find in a group of 3 or 4 tomorrow.
