title: eWaste Management
---

My household e-waste gets recycled. I bring my old electronics to the nearest Staples to be recycled and properly disposed of. Old electronics are full of chemicals and toxins that should not be in landfills, but instead should be properly dismantled and disposed of. Recycling drop off centres will typically dismantle the e-waste and send the plastic parts to landfills. They will send recyclable metal overseas and they will dispose of any heavy metals in a safe manner. The transport of recyclable metals overseas poses a threat to the environment and to the people who are exposed to the harmful toxins that are present (NPR, 2010). E-waste needs to be properly disposed of and it is important to not just put these items in your trash can or recycling bin. Although the transport of recyclable metals has a negative impact on the environment it is important to recycle electronics at recycling drop off centres. I plan on continuing to bring my e-waste to be recycled at Staples. However, I plan to generate less e-waste by using my electronics till their expiry date. Also, I plan to get my broken electronics repaired rather than replacing them. There are many locations all over Manitoba that recycle electronics, so it is very important to find one nearest to you and bring all your old electronics to it.
