Last January, my husband [Nick](http://harveynick.com/) innocently remarked that since I had spent 134 days away from home, it would be nice for us to spend a bit more time together at home...

As it turns out, it only took a global pandemic to have 24/7 time together for the last nine months...! ðŸ˜†

__Professionally I had an exceptional year,__ including:
* [A promotion to Vice President](/2020/07/16/promotion-to-vp-plus-im-hiring/)
* [Joining Helio as an advisor](/2020/05/05/i-am-joining-helio-as-an-advisor/)
* [Launching the CNCF End User Tech Radar](/2020/06/12/introducing-the-cncf-technology-radar/)
* [Hiring CNCF's first Ecosystem Advocate](/2020/11/04/cncf-welcomes-katie-gamanji-as-ecosystem-advocate/)
* [Winning the individual #TechWomen100 award](/2020/11/16/cheryl-hung-wins-the-techwomen100-award-2020/)

My favourite talk was my [keynote at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America](/2020/11/17/kubecon-cloudnativecon-na-2020-keynote-are-certifications-worth-it/), including a fun demo of the certification exam:

__It's been a difficult year personally.__ I lost my [grandfather and uncle to Covid-19](/2020/04/01/my-grandfather-has-passed-away-due-to-covid-19/) in April, and [my former boss Dan](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/in-memoriam-dan-kohn/) in November. Like most people, I burned out several times, including being horrendously sick during filming of the keynote above.

__However, I have much to be grateful for.__ I started playing music again after 14 years. I've studied Mandarin for 255+ days straight. I've reconnected with old friends and family in Hong Kong. I [moved the Cloud Native London meetup online](/2020/03/17/cloud-native-london-going-virtual-and-thoughts-on-running-a-large-meetup/) and am so grateful to my speakers, sponsors and loyal community who make it possible to keep going and even expand into [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cloudnativelon) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQxZcD4SJRukX5Ae4ZZjL8A) livestreams:

__Above all I remain optimistic.__ I don't know what life will look like this year. But I've been blessed to receive many opportunities, and be able to give opportunities to others and watch them grow. Thank you all for sticking by my side through an extraordinary year.

Until we meet again,

Cheryl
