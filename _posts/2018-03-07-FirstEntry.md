Finally! I'm live and my blog is running!

This is my first entry. Maybe I'll edit that one later but we'll see.
Let's keep it short for now.

The reason why I created this blog is to keep myself motivated during my neverending coding journey.
I'll write down what I've learned so far and where I'll be struggling.
My goal is to become a professional full stack developer one day. Wish me luck, guys!

At the moment I'm learning some HTML/CSS and will move on to Javascript pretty soon.
I'm excited since I can use Javascript to create my own Plugins for RPG Maker MV.
Let's see how this will work out. I'm faithful.

So guys, that's all for now. See you around!
