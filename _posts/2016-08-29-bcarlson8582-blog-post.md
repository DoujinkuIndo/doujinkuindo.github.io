1. As an aerospace engineer major, I'm interested in theoretical physics. I really enjoy hearing about ongoing theories proposed by
  NASA and how they could be implemented to benefit the global community. Therefore, I'm interested in scientific research and current theories
  relating to space and air travel.
2. The topics that interest me is how people decide to make decisions and how other people affect the decisions they make. I'm curious to
  see how digital humanities relates to people I see and hear about everyday and the impact that humanities has on how I see other people.
3. After reading through the digital literacies, I've narrowed it down to judgement, multitasking, and play. I chose these because they all
  relate to how people decide to act around one another, which is one of my greatest curiosities. I chose multitasking specifically because
  mastery of this could help me learn how I could multitask better myself.
