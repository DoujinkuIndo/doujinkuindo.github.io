OK. I really meant to do this closer to the start of the year, but I kept forgetting. Below is my Five and Dime list for 2014. What's a Five and Dime list? It's a list of all games I played 5+ or 10+ times. I review a lot of games, so not a lot get repeat play. It's always interesting to see what games actually got played this much.

***10 or more plays***

Magic: The Gathering: 13 plays

***5 or more plays***

Pok√©mon Trading Card Game: 9 plays

Eleminis: 8 plays

Golem Arcana: 6 plays

Knee Jerk: 5 plays

Tsuro: 5 plays
