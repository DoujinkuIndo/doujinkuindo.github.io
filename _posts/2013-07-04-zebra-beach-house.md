# Zebra — Beach House

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-wfb25WmV4 This song, once romantic, evokes notions of complacency — of the lazy happiness that has the tendency to tie itself to romance, or family life, or success. I fear this, really — I don't want to be complacent. Less than anything. So this song, which doesn't even _have_ emotional content, and its tempo, its repetitive notions, its mood and feel; they're tied inextricably to this feeling, the feeling that lets you lie around on a couch all day, just passing the time. I think of it now as a sin, to be happy and waste that happiness in such a way. I want my happiness to push me.
