# Idioteque — Obadiah Parker (Radiohead cover)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El3ivyKx2oo This is a cover that comes along to change everything about a song — already a stretch from the usual repertoire, Radiohead's _Idioteque_ is techno, synth-poppy, weird and paranoid and seemingly as unmelodic as a song can get, at least at first. But Obadiah Parker's band here takes the frantic rhythms and absolutely brings them to life, turning whatever Radiohead is into indie pop, orchestral and brilliant and choppy — and, above all, melodic. Despite the normal chord sequences, the normal meter, the standard drumming and piano — it comes together in a syncopated way, like birdsong, repetitive and predictable but always new, just one or two beats ahead of where you think it should be.
