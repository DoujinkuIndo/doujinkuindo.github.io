# Twistin' the Night Away — Sam Cooke

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSoPeZMHMf4 This song, as the boundary between jazz/swing/bop to rock'n'roll. Not rock, but not big band; there's a showmanship that befits real rock'n'roll, Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry and maybe the Temptations. Maybe more R&B. This song, tied to my parents' joint 50th birthday parties; there was a playlist, full of decades of music, from the old to the new; a retrospective through their lives. I got a copy of the playlist, and this song stuck. It's so modern in its sensibilities; it starts with a tag, it balances equal time of vocals and not, even within verses; there's a horn callback; it's swung but steady; it's dance music, endlessly danceable, soulful and happy and charmed and perfectly befitting of my parents' great big party, full of dance and food and alcohol. I went to bed at ten.
