title: Setting up the Radioddity GD-77 in two Easy Steps
---
# Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need the following:
*Windows 7 PC 
and
* [DMR Radio ID](https://www.radioid.net/cgi-bin/trbo-database/register.cgi)
* [Radioddity GD-77 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Radioddity-GD-77-400-470MHz-Compatible-Programming/dp/B0749LHXFQ)

# Installing the Latest Firmware
1. Log in to the [radiooddity downloads page](https://www.radioddity.com/radioddity_download/) and download firmware version 3.1.3
2. Install the Software on your Windows PC
3. Update the Radio's Firmware
# Installing the Latest Code Plug
After tinkering with the Radiooddity software for a short time, I determined it would be easier to just get a code plug than try to figure out the specifics of how Talk Groups, RX Groups, Zones and Contacts all work together to make a working radio.  

1. I downloaded the latest GD-77 Codeplug from the [Ohio Arrl Digital Page](http://arrl-ohio.org/digital/digital.html) 
2. Then, modify the codeplug to include your unique DMR Radio ID
3. Then, I uploaded modified code plug to the radio.
4. Keep in Mind, this code plug only has Ohio repeaters and zones.
