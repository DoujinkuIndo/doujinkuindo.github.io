title: Setting up the Radioddity GD-77 in two Easy Steps
---
# Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need the following:
* Windows 7 PC 
and
* [DMR Radio ID](https://www.radioid.net/cgi-bin/trbo-database/register.cgi)
* [Radioddity GD-77 from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Radioddity-GD-77-400-470MHz-Compatible-Programming/dp/B0749LHXFQ)

# Installing the Latest Firmware
1. Log in to the [radiooddity downloads page](https://www.radioddity.com/radioddity_download/) and download firmware version 3.1.3
2. Install the Software on your Windows PC
3. Update the Radio's Firmware
# Installing the Latest Code Plug
After tinkering with the Radiooddity software for a short time, I determined it would be easier to just get a code plug than try to figure out the specifics of how Talk Groups, RX Groups, Zones and Contacts all work together to make a working radio.  

1. Downloaded the latest GD-77 Codeplug from the [Ohio Arrl Digital Page](http://arrl-ohio.org/digital/digital.html) 
2. Then, modify the codeplug to include your unique DMR Radio ID
3. Then, upload the modified code plug to the radio.
4. Keep in mind, this code plug only has ohio repeaters and zones.
