So...

It turns out the servos/gimbal combo I bought is kind of crap.
And the power converter I've been using is about to die or something because it only puts out about 4 volts to the servos. 
So I'm returning the gimbal and buying better servos + new power supplies.
They should arrive early next week; I'll get back to this then.
