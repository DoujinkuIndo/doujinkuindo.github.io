# People Like Us — Talking Heads

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNcjWdHD6GQ _True Stories _was a movie by David Byrne, and then an album by _Talking Heads_, and I'm not sure if it even matters which was first — I only know the album, but I think it's fascinating that the same song exists [as sung by a very young John Goodman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9a1JQi7G3k). Moreover, this is a song about the midwest, at least for me — it's vaguely country, but modern and 80s and nihilistic and resigned to the life given, modern America and strip malls and blue collar jobs and a — what's the opposite of romanticized? — version of American life around the turn of the century, the second one — the songs are from 1986, but they're still relevant, maybe not paranoid enough. But they're incredible and terrifying, about a brand new world, full of appearances and reflection and navel-gazing, progress and technology and ignorance, and I feel the meaning chasing me around, trying very hard to tell me something just out of reach.
