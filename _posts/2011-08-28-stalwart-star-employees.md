Just read two interesting articles by Thomas Delong over at the Harvard Business School:

- [Stop Ignoring the Stalwart Worker](http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2011/08/stop-ignoring-the-stalwart-wor.html)
- [Searching for Professional Significance](http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2011/07/searching-for-professional-sig.html)

To be honest, I've pretty much always seen two types of workers, performers and under-performers, so reading these has opened my mind to a few new thoughts.

The first article on Stalwart workers debunks 5 myths:

- Stars are smarter than Stalwarts.
- Everybody is the same.
- Everybody wants the same thing out of work.
- Everybody wants to be promoted.
- Everybody wants to be a manager.

It reminds of a saying that has had a lot of significance for me personally:

>I am unique.
>Just like everyone else.
>We all have our strengths.
>We all have our weaknesses.
>That is what makes us unique.

Everybody does want the same thing. That is happiness. They way we each get there is somewhat different.
