# Welcome
"Now, this is a story all about how, My life got flipped in automated style. And I liked to take a minute just sit right there, I'll tell you how i automated my workplace"

## What is Web automation ?

Home automation gives you access to control devices in your home from a mobile device anywhere in the world. for example, your smart thermostat, smart TV, smart light... pretty much everything with smart. Mr Davis used to say "keep your smart phone and not so smart phone off" while we used to write our exam... ah memories. 

## What is home assistant ?

Home assistant is home automation hub. or Home automation software to be more precise. It's free and open source and fully local alternative to things like HomeBridge and SmartThings. It gives you the power of home automation without the cloud so you won't depend on internet connection or remote servers. This result in faster operation and reliability. 

So i was able to spin up a HASSIO server on my raspi. and let me tell you it is awesome, I got so much control over my Iot devices and plus that I can write my own onn esp8266 and esp32. BLE$$ED.

Now To explain What is HASSIO >
