# Welcome
"Now, this is a story all about how, My life got flipped upside down. And I liked to take a minute just sit right there, I'll tell you how i helped my workplace get automated"

## What is Web automation ?

 Think of all the clicking and typing you do at your desk every day involving websites and web-based applications. All these actions can be automated with web automation.

Actions that can be automated include:

    Filling out forms and fields
    Scraping content from a web page
    Extracting and transferring data between applications
    Clicking buttons and elements

Every day, in businesses of all sizes, there are scenarios where automating tasks like these would come in handy. For example:

    Importing contacts into a CRM system from a third-party service
    Testing the user experience and order handling of an online shop
    Integrating a web-based ERP-system with a document management platform in the cloud
