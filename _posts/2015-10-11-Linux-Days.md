title: Linux Days 2015
---

This weekend I attended the [LinuxDays](https://www.linuxdays.cz/) conference
at FIT CVUT in Prague.
In between studying, I got to see some talks, most of which were quite good.
The ones I liked most were:

* Grafy a datová analýza v Gnuplotu by Ondřej Guth
* Poor Man's Cloud by Jan Baier
* Kubernetes - úklid mezi kontejnery by Tomáš Kukrál
