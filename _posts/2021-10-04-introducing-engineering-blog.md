Earlier this year when we introduced [Maxwell's operating principles](https://himaxwell.com/resources/blog/introducing-maxwells-operating-principles/){:target="_blank"},
we highlighted the idea of the ["bicycle of the mind"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmuP8gsgWb8&ab_channel=k0rthaj){:target="_blank"}. For us at Maxwell,
the "bicycle of the mind" captures the role of technology as a whole to amplify human ability to spectacular magnitudes.

As a team we view our mission to research, develop, and engineer the "bicycles of the mind" that give every lender in our network a permanent,
disruptive financial advantage in their market.

As we make progress on that mission, we want to share the stories and learnings of our work, processes, and culture that makes Maxwell special. So today we are
officially launching the Maxwell R&D & Engineering blog!

We think we are doing some really cool things here at Maxwell, and our sincere hope is that you find this content educational and
informative on your engineering journeys.

I would love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and feedback as you come across our posts. Feel free to reach me at rutul@himaxwell.com.
