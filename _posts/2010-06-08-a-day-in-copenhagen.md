Because I don&#8217;t feel like writing much detail, here&#8217;s a summary:

&#8211; walked all morning  
&#8211; saw the Royal Residencies  
&#8211; went to where the Little Mermaid normally resides. Currently it is somewhere in Asia, so there&#8217;s a TV screen with a picture of the Little Mermaid on it. Way to make a boring, insignificant statue even more boring and insignificant.  
&#8211; Â walked through Kings Park  
&#8211; attempted to look for clothes&#8230; before realising the value of the Danish Kroner is ridonkulous!  
&#8211; went to Tivoli (amusement park) and almost blacked out. Will fill you in on the details later. The park doesn&#8217;t offer massive amounts, but the little it does offer is fair intense. Aside from it&#8217;s EXACT replica of the Little Mermaid. Even it sucks. Get better symbols, Copenhagen.  
&#8211; may have gotten another piercing.  
&#8211; sat in maccas using up their free internet while eating deep fried cheesy Camembert bites.

Denmark still rules.

I&#8217;m thinking of giving up on my Gothenburg half-hatched plans&#8230; it&#8217;s going to cost the best part of $200 for the car, I&#8217;ll get in at maybe 6 or 7 pm, and will have to head back to Copenhagen by about 11am the next morn. Doesn&#8217;t seem worth it. Instead I think over the next day and a half I&#8217;ll go visit Christiania (old fort turned hippie commune), head out on a train to Roskilde for a look at some killer Viking boats, then over to Malmo which is now a part of Sweden. I will get to Sweden one way or another dammit!

Pretty sure it&#8217;s time to head back to Tivoli for a couple more rides.

Adios muchachos!
