# Nodes and Strings

You can represent the world as a series of nodes and vectors, yeah? With each person as a point and a motivation, an arrow towards what they want most. People are complex; they have lots of arrows drawing them in lots of directions, and they’ll eventually reach an equilibrium. A point between points, one that satisfies them and makes them — and by them I of course am talking about myself — as being someplace they (I) want to be. A step in either direction would be too much risk, and risk has downfalls and emotional vulnerability. But a happy compromise is the lesser of three evils — it gets tedious, monotonous, boring,and it guides us to seek out danger in our fantasies and our circumstances, encourages a boring life of consuming dramatic stories, or worse a boring life hiding a more secretive, dramatic one. If only we could live as honestly as our idols do, not hidden behind a veil of maturity and common sense, but free to act selfishly and greedily, out of love or want or need, without being, and, well, I don’t mean to say judged. We are judged when people see us as doing something averse to our typical persona. But there shouldn’t be a persona, only a person who does hat they want all the time, and the cards fall as they will. People as nodes and vectors and points with strings between them: people do what they want and the strings pull taut, and things settle into their best places.
