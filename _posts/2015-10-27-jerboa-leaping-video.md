After dabbling at some [boom-assisted steady-state hopping]({% post_url 2015-03-31-jerboa-hopping-video %}), Jerboa is now trying out transitional behaviors in 3D!

This project was based on [Aaron's initial work with RHex](http://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/Aaron/ICRA2013), and Anna Brill (superstar undergrad) was enthusiastic enough to try out some of the same on a much hokier robot. 

The [paper](http://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/Avik/IROS15) corresponding to this video was one of the most ones I have written, in part because of some great co-authors.
