As we start to plan for the next revision of the Java EE Platform (Java EE 8), we would like to get input from the community on the relative importance of some of the features that we might add.

Please participate in the _Java EE 8 features survey_ (now closed!) to let your voice be heard and help us prepare the future of Java EE, it shouldn't take you more than a few minutes! 

This is the first part of a two-part survey. We'll be announcing part 2 in the beginning of the new year. So again, if you want to help shaping the future of Java EE, please participate in the survey.
