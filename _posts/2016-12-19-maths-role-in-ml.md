# Tool vs. target  

I believe that one of the crutial and secret part of success for a carreer, particularly in AIML is that one should distinquish clearly between *target* and *tool*. *Target* is what you want to achieve or decode in your models (do not confuse the word *target* here with target function) and *tool* is what actually helps you realize your *target*.  They are both indispensable but your contributions are mostly from *target*, not *tool* even if in a typical academic paper, you would see its larger portion dedicated to presenting *tool*.
