In this post, I attempt to point out that AIML is not mathematics even if mathematics play an important role in AIML.   
**Target vs. tool**: AIML is target while mathematics is just a tool or a forma language to describe your models.   

I believe that one of the crutial and secret part of success for a career, particularly in AIML is that one should distinguish clearly between *target* and *tool*. *Target* is what you want to achieve or decode in your models (do not confuse the word *target* here with target function) and *tool* is what actually helps you realize your *target*.  They are both indispensable but your contributions are mostly from *target*, not *tool* even if you would see a larger portion of a typical academic paper dedicated to presenting *tool*.  

In particular for AIML, *tool* is *mathematics* and *programming* while *target* is priors which are reasonable behaviors that you force your model to owe. Since *programming* can be viewed as just a realization of *mathematics* which is in the lower level, I only focus on *mathematics* when refer to *tool* in this post. From my perspective at this moment, *mathematics* in AIML field (I am talking about mathematics in a particular field AIML, not in general) in its own right is meaningless until you use them to encode priors into your model. In another word, *mathematics* is not intelligent in its own right, it simply follows logical rules. It is an AIML reseacher's role to come up with reasonable and well-educated priors and make use of *mathematics* to force such priors into their model's behaviors ,hence, giving *mathematics* a meaning.
