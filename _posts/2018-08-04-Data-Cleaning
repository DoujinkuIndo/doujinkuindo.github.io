I recently read a helpful [article by John Sullivan](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/5-data-science-projects-hired.html) on skills to showcase for a career in data science. He describes data cleaning as requiring these skills:

Importing data
Joining multiple datasets
Detecting missing values
Detecting anomalies
Imputing for missing values
Data quality assurance

During this cleaning I discovered the Caifornia Deparment of Education (CDE) doesn't keep track of closed schools after some time. Since 1981, 322 schools are forgotten. If you look at the national data, it is even worse. This seems a seems a shame for people that went to those schools, even though they are closed now. What if they are interested in how their school performed in the past stacked up against other schools? They will never know because CDE let their records rot. 

In order to prepare data for enrollment analysis, I performed most of the cleaning tasks outlined above. Below I share the code and reasoning I used to perform these tasks.

#Import<a name="import"></a>
##Download Files
Originally I wrote a scraper in python to bulk download the files from http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/, however I was having timeout issues from the cde server and clicking a few dozen links isn't that bad, so I downloaded by hand.
File formats include .csv, .xls, .txt, .zip, .dbf, .exe (all pretty straightforward except that on mac .dbf requires OpenOffice and .exe are self-extracting zip files that can be unzipped on the command line). 
I converted all files to either .txt or .csv and organized the files in a Data/ subdirectory within the project directory.

##Import Files
In this case I imported files directly from a local repository. For the most part this only requires the [read.table](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.5.1/topics/read.table) function from base R.
.txt are tab delimeted and .csv are comma delimited so the main difference is the sep parameter:

For .txt files
'''R
DT.list <- lapply(file.list, read.table, fill=TRUE, na.strings=c("", "NA"), sep ="\t", quote = "", header=TRUE, check.names=FALSE)
'''
For .csv there is a built-in read.csv that makes sep=","
'''R
DT.list <- lapply(file.list, read.csv, header=TRUE, check.names=FALSE)
'''
##File Lists
I used naming conventions to differentiate files with slightly different structure that needed to be modifed to combine them into a single data table. Then I used regex to collect files of similar type into file lists. Once we have a list of files, we can use lapply to perform read.table on all of the files and put the resulting data frames in a list. A list of data frames can be named by year and actions can be performed on their columns en masse.
For example, with the EL data that was in .csv format I found that '80 contained a duplicate CDS_CODE column that needed to be removed. Notice that I was able to remove that column before renaming all of the columns and combining all of the data frames into one data table with [rbindlist](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/versions/1.11.8/topics/rbindlist) from the data.table package.

'''R
# Convert file list into a data.table with an ID row (Using starting year as the year indicator)
DT.list <- lapply(el8000.list, read.csv, header=TRUE, check.names=FALSE)
setattr(DT.list, 'names', c("1980", "1981", "1982","1983", "1984", "1985", "1986", "1987", "1988", "1989", "1990", "1991", "1992", "1993", "1994", "1995", "1996", "1997", "1998", "1999", "2000"))
DT.list$`1980`$'CDS_CODE,C,14' <- NULL # Remove duplicate CDS col from 1980
DT.list <- lapply(DT.list, setNames, colnames)
DT00 <- rbindlist(DT.list, use.names=TRUE, fill=TRUE, idcol='YEAR') # creates data.table from list of data.frames
'''

#Join
It has been shown that rbindlist is significantly [faster than rbind](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2851327/convert-a-list-of-data-frames-into-one-data-frame), so ideally we can modify our list of dataframes and create one long list before our call to rbindlist. This requires that each dataframe have the same structure (number of variables, colnames, coltypes). When I was unable to put all of the data frames in one list, I used rbind to bind the rows of the data tables.
CDE does include a file structure file for each individual file, so I looked through these to find some structural changes to the data. 
##Enrollment
With enrollment data, these changes created 5 timespans: 1981-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2017. The primary difference was that ETHNIC categories changed as discussed in my post on [Enrollments by Ethnicity]().
Additionally there are historical enrollment files from 1948-1980, however they don't include many variables. 1948-1969 seperates grades and gender, 1970-1976 seperates gender, 1977-1980 only have county-level enrollment (no School-level data, no ethinicities).
###CDS_CODE
County, District, and School values are missing from 1981-1992, 1993-1997, and 2007-2008, so these are imputed with correct values from a database of California Public Schools.
'''R
# Load database of California Public Schools
# CDE doesn't keep complete CDS records at https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/pubschls.asp
pubsch <- read.table("./Data/CA/pubschls.txt", fill=TRUE, na.strings=c("", "NA"), sep ="\t", quote = "", header=TRUE)
pubsch <- data.table(pubsch)
setnames(pubsch, c("CDSCode", "County", "District", "School"), c("CDS_CODE", "COUNTY", "DISTRICT", "SCHOOL"))
pubsch <- pubsch[, CDS_CODE:=as.character(CDS_CODE)]
# Attempted NCES list at https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/geographicGeocode.aspx but it was LESS schools

# Create data.table with CDSCode County District School Charter Latitude Longitude
sch <- pubsch[,.(CDS_CODE, COUNTY, DISTRICT, SCHOOL, Charter, Latitude, Longitude)]
setkey(sch, CDS_CODE)
sch <- unique(sch)

# Create data.table with school CDS information only
cds <- sch[,.(CDS_CODE, COUNTY, DISTRICT, SCHOOL)]
setkey(cds, CDS_CODE)

# Set key for data tables
setkey(DT92, CDS_CODE); setkey(DT06, CDS_CODE); setkey(DT97, CDS_CODE); setkey(DT16, CDS_CODE)

# Reorder cols in DT92, DT08 and DT16
setcolorder(DT08, c("CDS_CODE", "COUNTY", "DISTRICT", "SCHOOL", "YEAR", "ETHNIC", "GENDER", "KDGN", "GR_1", "GR_2", "GR_3", "GR_4", "GR_5", "GR_6", "GR_7", "GR_8", "UNGR_ELM", "GR_9", "GR_10", "GR_11", "GR_12", "UNGR_SEC", "ENR_TOTAL", "ADULT"))
setcolorder(DT16, c("CDS_CODE", "COUNTY", "DISTRICT", "SCHOOL", "YEAR", "ETHNIC", "GENDER", "KDGN", "GR_1", "GR_2", "GR_3", "GR_4", "GR_5", "GR_6", "GR_7", "GR_8", "UNGR_ELM", "GR_9", "GR_10", "GR_11", "GR_12", "UNGR_SEC", "ENR_TOTAL", "ADULT"))

# Merge County, District, School onto 92, 97 and 06 datatables
DT92 <- cds[DT92] # duplicates existing district and school
DT97 <- cds[DT97]
DT06 <- cds[DT06]
'''
###Ethnicity
Since ETHNIC categories changed I kept four timespans as seperate .csv files.

##English Larners
For ELs there is a hint about the TOTAL variable starting in 95 and changing in 98. However, changing colnames is straightforward, the full story is that the filetype changes between starting year 2000 and 2001, there are no header rows for starting years 2002-2008, and the duplicate column in '80 that was removed in the code snippet for file lists above.

##Free/Reduced Lunch
There is a change in filetype between 2003 and 2004. In the first set there are 3 different groups of variables (1988-1997 13 variables, 1998 14 variables, 1999-2003 15 variables) a sample of the structure from the file list is shown below:

I add year and district columns to 1998, and there is an extra column called "Rank" that may need to be removed for merging... or if it looks to be on later years (2004+), we can add it to these. Additionally, before 1998 includes AFDC_PCT and FREE_PCT, and these two variables need to be added post 1998. Finally, post 1997 include CALWORKS, TOTAL_MEAL, CALW_PCT, MEAL_PCT. The two MEAL vars can be backfilled, but Calworks is specific to post-97. So these are two seperate date ranges. The final list of colnames for each range should be,
'''R
colnames97 <- c("YEAR", "C", "D", "S", "DISTRICT", "SCHOOL", "GRD_SPAN", "PUBLIC_ENR", "PRIVATE_ENR", "RED_MEALS", "FREE_MEALS", "TOTAL_MEAL", "CALW_PCT", "RED_PCT", "FREE_PCT", "MEAL_PCT")
colnames98 <- c("YEAR", "C", "D", "S", "DISTRICT", "SCHOOL", "GRD_SPAN", "PUBLIC_ENR", "PRIVATE_ENR", "CALWORKS", "RED_MEALS", "FREE_MEALS", "TOTAL_MEAL", "CALW_PCT", "RED_PCT", "FREE_PCT", "MEAL_PCT")
'''

In the second set, there are multiple changes in variables: every starting year until 2014 has a different structure file... 2004 20 vars? (14), 2005 13 vars, 2006 14, 2007 14, 2008 14, 2009 14 , 2010 14 , 2011 15, 2012 22, 2013 28, 2014-2017 28. 
So it looks as though the same colnames from 1998 can be used until 2011. Followed by one or two more name vectors in 2012 and 2013-2017. First I checked if the headers in 2017 were the same as 2013 colnames,

#Missing Values
Since CDE doesn't keep complete CDS records at https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/pubschls.asp, we did our best to heal rows of schools with undefined CDS_CODEs. One successful approach was to recover the C,D,S of NA CDS codes after 1996 from the 1992 data. The script to recover the CDS is included below,
'''R
# ================== Check NA values =============================

Much of this code duplication could have been avoided by placing the data.tables in a list. However, the counts in the comments show how *this process was able to recover over 90% of the missing CDS values.* The meat of the recovery lies within the recoverLostCDS() function,
'''R
# Recover lost CDS labels from '92 data
recoverLostCDS <- function(DT92, sch) {
  cdsna92 <- unique(subset(DT92, is.na(SCHOOL), select=CDS_CODE)) # unlabeled schools
  setkey(cdsna92, CDS_CODE)
  setkey(DT92, CDS_CODE)
  cds92 <- unique(DT92[,.(CDS_CODE, DistrictName, SchoolName)])[cdsna92] # recovered District/School for NA
  # Recover COUNTY field
  countyDist <- sch[,.(COUNTY, DISTRICT)]
  setkey(countyDist, DISTRICT)
  countyDist <- unique(countyDist)
  # Remove "Elementary" and "High" from DISTRICT and DistrictName to increase matches
  countyDist[,DISTRICT:=sapply(as.character(DISTRICT), removeWords, stopwords = c("Elementary", "High"))]
  cds92[,DistrictName:=sapply(as.character(DistrictName), removeWords, stopwords = c("Elementary", "High"))]
  setkey(countyDist, DISTRICT)
  countyDist <- unique(countyDist) # Remove duplicate districts (used to have elem + high)

    Check variables in the header row
    Recovered some lost data from missing values
    Dropped missing values rather than imputing
    Merged various tables to create a larger dataset for visualizations and analysis
