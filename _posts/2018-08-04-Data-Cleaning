I recently read a helpful [article by John Sullivan](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/5-data-science-projects-hired.html) on skills to showcase for a career in data science. He describes data cleaning as requiring these skills:

Importing data
Joining multiple datasets
Detecting missing values
Detecting anomalies
Imputing for missing values
Data quality assurance

In order to prepare data for the enrollments analysis, I performed the following tasks:
    Import yearly files
    Check variables in the header row
    Recovered some lost data from missing values
    Dropped missing values rather than imputing
    
Below I share the code I used to perform these tasks.
