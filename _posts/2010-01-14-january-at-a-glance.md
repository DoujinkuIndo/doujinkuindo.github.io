<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Already been:</span>  
7 &#8211; **Burning Empires** @ Spectrum  
Really good show. Band made up of guys from Misery Signals + drummer from Fall Out Boy

8 &#8211; **The Temper Trap**, Bridezilla @ Enmore Theatre  
Show was packed. Was an ok set, but nowhere near as good as I remember at Glastonbury. The support, Bridezilla, were really snoozeworthy, actually almost fell asleep. Had a post-show party with guys from work & Liberation.

9 &#8211; **Black Joe Lewis & The Honeybears** @ Martin Place (part of Sydney Festival First Night)  
I don&#8217;t remember them being all that good at Lollapalooza, but this set was loads of fun, even if the night was incredibly hot.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">To come:</span>  
18 &#8211; **Walter Schreifels** & **Jamie Hay** @ The Sandringham  
19 &#8211; **Rise Against** / **A Death In The Family** @ The Enmore
