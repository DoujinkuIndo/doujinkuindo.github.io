I'm Petroleum Engineering junior at [Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology](http://rgipt.ac.in/)

My name is Girish Joshi and I’m a pre-final year student at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, majoring in Petroleum Engineering. 

I’m a self-motivated man with outstanding academic record and a passion for learning by doing. As a part of Tinkering Lab – RGIPT’s Technical Club I learn new technologies and try to find their applications for Oil & Gas Industry. I spent my last summer making a quadcopter fly and building a low-cost Plough Depth Sensor. You can read about it here.  

I am also the convener for the Kode Club at my institute. I teach coding and emerging technologies (Machine Learning, Internet of Things)
