In which I admit for the first time on camera that I kind of hate infrastructure! (25:16)

This was a super fun panel, featuring Forrest and Kevin on the merits of serverless vs containers and ably moderated by Greg. Of course I don't actually hate infrastructure ðŸ˜‰ but as an application developer by background, infrastructure is unreliable and challenging, so I'm a fan of all approaches that simplify the experience of shipping code and running with infrastructure.
