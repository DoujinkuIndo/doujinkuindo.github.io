title: EA Games' CEO resigns due to company failures
---

CEO John Riccitiello of EA Games announces his resignation, effective March 30th, and current Chairman of the board, Larry Probst, has been appointed Executive Chairman.

To say that EA has gone through a rough patch over the past two years would be nothing less than an understatement. From their online gaming service Origin to “Star Wars: The Old Republic” and from “Mass Effect 3” to, the most recent, “SimCity,” EA has continued to anger both fans and shareholders. In fact, in an internal memo from Riccitiello to the employees of EA, Riccitiello holds himself personally responsible:

“My decision to leave EA is really all about my accountability for the shortcomings in our financial results this year. It currently looks like we will come in at the low end of, or slightly below, the financial guidance we issued to the Street, and we have fallen short of the internal operating plan we set one year ago. And for that, I am 100 percent accountable.”

In attempts to remove themselves from Valve’s online marketplace and game launcher, Steam, Electronic Arts launched their own digital video game marketplace named Origin in June of 2011. Many gamers criticize EA pulling their games from Steam and developing their own system. The move has caused a need for gamers to create a new account in which they need to find and add all their friends, install another piece of software on their computers and trust that the brand new system is secure. On top of that, Origin only sells and launches EA’s games, whereas Steam sells and launches games from hundreds of developers.

First announced in 2008, “Star Wars: The Old Republic” was supposed to be the killer of Activision Blizzard’s world dominating MMO, “World of Warcraft.” The game finally launched in December 2011, with EA boasting it already had 1.5 million subscribers on the first day. Not quite the “WoW-killer” they were hoping for. While WoW’s subscription numbers were reported to drop near the release of “The Old Republic,” those subscribers quickly went running back to Activision Blizzard. “WoW” still maintains a strong 10 million monthly subscribers. While these numbers may be upsetting, EA said that they could recuperate costs of development with only 500,000 subscribers.

EA’s next disappointment was a double-whammy. March 2012 marked the release of the third and final game in the “Mass Effect” series, “Mass Effect 3.” Fans were outraged when EA released DLC on day one, rather than including the content in the game.

Here’s what EA had to say:

“From Ashes is a 600 MB+ download with all new content, including the mission on Eden Prime, new dialogue options and conversations with Javik, new cinematics, the Prothean weapon, and new appearances for all squad members. All of the above content was completed while the main game was in certification and are not available on the disc.

"As stated previously, in order to seamlessly integrate Javik into the core campaign, certain framework elements and character models needed to be put on disc. We did something similar with Zaeed and Kasumi in Mass Effect 2.”

While the content was designed after the game was fully created and awaiting certification, it was a poor judgment call on EA’s part to release the content at launch.

The second issue fans had with “Mass Effect 3” is the ending. While in games past, players could change the outcome of the game depending on what choices they made during the play through of the main story. These changes varied from where you were when the game ended to which of your crew members were a live and which ones had died. “ME3” let its fans down when they reached the end of the game. Instead of the ending varying like its predecessors, the only difference this time was the lighting color of the final scene…yes, the lighting: green, blue or red.

EA’s most recent game to warrant such harsh criticism is the new “SimCity,” released on March 5. The launch has been plagued with server errors so severe that there are hours at a time where players cannot even log in to play. For an online game this would make a good amount of players upset, however, this has also tormented single player. Why? Because EA chose that every time you launch the game (using Origin), the game must connect to their DRM servers for authentication. While this was intended to help prevent piracy, it really kicks the loyal player who purchased the game while their already down. No more playing “SimCity” on your laptop at grandma and grandpa’s house who don’t have Wi-Fi.

The fact that Riccitiello puts so much of the blame on himself for EA’s failures, really does make it appear that he had the final word in many key decisions. Hopefully they can find a new CEO who can pick them up and dust them off. With EA on such a steady decline already, there really isn’t anywhere to go but up.
