Another successful meetup, featuring Karolis Rusenas from StorageOS, James Munnelly from Jetstack and Steven Thwaites of Docker.

Around a hundred attendees joined me at Skills Matter, our new venue which has very professional AV and a bar.

Everything ran smoothly and we had some excellent questions throughout the talks. Most importantly, there was plenty of pizza, beer and networking, especially in the pub afterwards.
