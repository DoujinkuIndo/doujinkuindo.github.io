Some notes from [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow][Flow: The Psychology of Happiness]] One of the better
books I have read in the recent past. The book is slightly more on the
academic side than a regular non-fiction book, but worth the effort and
time to grok the book none the less. The book begins by defining what
the author means by flow experience and goes on describe the different
types of flow experience as well as ingredients for achieving a flow experience.

**Flow experience** 
 A state in which the activity (physical or mental) is all encompassing and the actor feels one with the environment and task.  In some sense, achieving flow experience is tied to being able order information 
in the  consciousness. This is the central theme of the book --
ordering of information in the consciousness. There are a lot of nice
quo table statements strewn through out the book which I would
paraphrase as "Pleasant is
not same as enjoyment,  enjoyment comes from overcoming challenges"

**What are the ingredients of flow**
The three ingredients to effect a flow experience are 1) Clear
Challenges and goals 2) Skills that match the challenge. When skills
are greater than challenges, it leads to boredom, while the other
side of the equilibrium leads to anxiety. 3) Constant Feedback on how
well the goals are being met. While initially the goals/challenges are
what motivate us to under take a task, later on the act of doing is self serving and joyful on its
own. To me, this idea seems to reflect the teachings of Srimad Bhagvad Git
that also talks about the doer having rights only over the action and,
never over the results.

**Lack of self awareness**
An interesting aspect of the flow experience is the destruction of the
self, forgetting the self during the activity and being deeply
involved in the task, and paying laser-like focus on the environment
for feedback. Another interesting idea in the book is around what
determines happiness in unfavorable/unpleasant situations that one
inevitably gets thrown in. Basically, more than the event, how we
interpret and respond to the event, determines our happiness in such
situations. In other words, being able to control the
information/order in our consciousness is the only determinant of our
happiness, not the external environment or the daily stuff that it
throws at us. Again, similar teachings can be gleaned from the Srimad
Bhagvad Gita. To quote from the book "Those who know how to transform
a hopeless situation into a new flow activity that can be controlled
will be able to enjoy and emerge stronger from the ordeal. Sooner or later everyone will have to confront events that affect the self like job loss, disappointments, illness etc. Being able to control how to respond to negative events and order consciouness is important 
to make progress."
