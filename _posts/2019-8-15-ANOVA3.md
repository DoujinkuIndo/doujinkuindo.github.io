title: ANOVA 3 - Evaluation of the effect of multiple factors (From one-way to multi-way)
---
Last time I have introduced the `F-statistic` and the partition of total variance into **explained** and **unexplained** variance. However, there may be more than one factor 
that contribute to the outcome of a variable. In such cases the **unexplained** part gets smaller as a part of it moves to the **explained** part. In this article I am going to
build the ground required to introduce two more jargons `interaction` and `experimental design`, which are important when more than one factors come into play. The content can
 be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/subhadeep1024/Blogs/blob/master/ANOVA3.ipynb)
