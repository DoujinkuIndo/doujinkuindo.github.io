Today I was lucky enough to receive and early access copy of [Total War: WARHAMMER](http://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/) for review/streaming. I did a [quick stream](https://www.twitch.tv/rkalajian/v/67447447) of the game's Campaign Mode using the Empire and running through the tutorial.

I've exported the video to YouTube. It runs about 19 minutes long, and you can watch me play while having no idea what the hell I'm doing. The tutorial wasn't much help, but I think I just need to play the game a bit more. Once I do, I'll be sure to get a review up.
