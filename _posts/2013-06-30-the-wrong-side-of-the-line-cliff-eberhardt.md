# The Wrong Side of the Line-- Cliff Eberhardt

(I can’t find a video of this song, but it’s really, really worth seeking out.) How often do you hear a song about Sherman’s March To The Sea?  (If it is often, good for you, and also who are you.)  If you are like me, and this is not a common occurrence but you kinda wish it were, than this is the song for you.  It’s also the song for you if you like simple, straightforward stories.  Well, straightforward until it starts makin’ you question the morality of apathy during war.  It’s just about a dude who happened to live in Savannah when Sherman was doing his thing.  The thing I like best about this song is its transition from a kind of sad but detached storytelling into “taking the lord’s name in vain.”  And by god, the way Cliff Eberhardt rips through “God damn Mason, God damn Dixon” is powerful.  It’s raw and angry reminds us of the lack of power of the individual, particularly the individual who doesn’t have strong beliefs.  It makes me think a lot about what apathy indicates.  Plus, you know.  It’s pretty.
