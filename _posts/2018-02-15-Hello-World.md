title: Hello World!

This is my first blog post, using my new Jekyll/GitHub Pages website. I looked at a few options for creating a personal website/blog - such as WordPress and Blogger, both of which I have used before, and are very user-friendly but quite clunky. 

I have had a GitHub account for a few years, and keep the code for all my personal/hobby projects in there. I knew GitHub Pages existed, but had never really looked into it before. On delving a little further, I discovered that, behind the scenes, it uses [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/), a Ruby-based static site generator, which is specifically designed for blogs and software documentation. I'd never heard of this, but was keen to find out more.

Initially, the idea of a blog based on static web pages sounded pretty archaic - surely dynamic page generation is the way to go? However, although it requires a bit more technical knowledge to set up, there are quite a few compelling reasons to use this approach:

* Performance: our web server is simply serving up static files - there is very little server-side processing
* TBC

It's also been a good opportunity to look at some new web frameworks and approaches which I haven't encountered before, namely:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/):  a simple, blog-aware, static site generator written in Ruby
* [JekyllNow](http://www.jekyllnow.com/): a pre-configured GitHub Pages blog which can be forked and customised
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): a scripting language used to generate CSS
* [YAML](http://yaml.org/): a human-readable data serialization language, commonly used for configuration files
* [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/): template lanugage for web apps

I will be adding content and functionality as and when over the coming weeks, so please check back soon.
