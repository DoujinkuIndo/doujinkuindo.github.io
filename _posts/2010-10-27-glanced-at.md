Two quick things:

- [Winerlinks](http://github.com/danielbachhuber/WinerLinks/blob/0.1/winerlinks.php) - Add Dave Winer style paragraph # marks to your WordPress.
- [Evernote 4.x is up for download on their site](https://www.evernote.com/about/download/).

I've oft thought about Dave Winers hash marks, which contain a permalink to each paragraph in his blog posts. Now, Daniel Bachhuber has made a WordPress plugin that does it automagically for you.

And of course, Evernote, now in version 4, my third favorite application, after the command prompt and ACT!.
