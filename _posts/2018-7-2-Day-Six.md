It seems like I'm mostly going to be reading today. I want to look at as many resources as possible today to try and find useful information -- I'm on an information safari. I'll be looking more carefully through the resources I meantioned [last Friday](https://thom-ory.github.io/day-five/) and trying to learn about aperture photometry (the process of determining and subtracting the background flux of an image to clearly determine which excitations of the CCD in the telescope are coming from the subject source). Hopefully, I'll be ready to go back to the [photometry code](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20practice/photometry_practice_updated.py) that I started the other day by tomorrow and figure out the last part of these exercises. After I get this code up and running, I should be able to take Hubble data, which is already reduced for photometry, and learn how many of the electron excitations (counts) that occurred on Hubble's CCD during the time of observation were due to photons that came from the stars in Hubble's field of view. After the code I have so far works, I need to learn how to reduce raw data (like the data I have from Diafi) so I can perform the same type of operation on that. Finally, once I have an accurate measure of the number of counts I have from each source in all the data I have from Diafi and Hubble, I'll have almost everything I need to make some initial color-magnitude diagrams. I only need to convert from counts to flux to magnitude and the astrometry from Marta, and she seems to be making a lot of progress with that and should have something by the time I'm ready for it. These first diagrams won't be the most useful ones of the summer, as we're really interested in Chandra X-ray data, but we still need them to best understand our sources. But, I hear that X-ray photometry is a little more difficult, so I'll cross that bridge once we extract all the information we can from Hubble and Diafi data. After we have X-ray photometry as well, we'll be able to make some real conclusions about the nature of X1, our name for the primary source of interest in NGC6819 and the catalyst for this study.
