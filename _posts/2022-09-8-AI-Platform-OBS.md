# AI Platform Training

**Huawei Cloud:**

This is a step-by-step guide for the NCAIâ€™s AI Platform. The platform is hosted using Huawei Software.

Start by setting up your account via the email you received from Technical Enablement (TE). Next, logout and login using IAM User as follows:

Account: NCAI_test1

User: your_user

Password: your_password

After verifying your account, you should familiarize yourself with the most important features for you as an AI Engineer. Which are:

- Object Storage Service (OBS)
- Elastic Cloud Server (ECS)
- Model Arts

In this tutorial we will go through the OBS functionality and its benefits.

OBS is an object-based storage service that provides customers with massive, secure, reliable, and cost-effective data storage capabilities. OBS allows the user to benefit from the AI platform in an efficient way.

When creating the bucket, you can choose to define an Enterprise Project to manage all the services and who can read/write to this bucket. 

- I was able to connect to the notebook using VS code in the DevEnviron
- Each time I start the notebook I have to install all the extensions again
- There is no timeout for the notebook; I have to specify a period before I start, which is not convenient.
