### Homework: Quality Analysis

## Quadrant of the matrix

 horizontal: Business Fancing: describing to a business expert.   
 
│Q1   Q2│
│Q3   Q4│   

horizontal: technology facing: talking to a product ***check detectors***

vertical left: Supporting programming-***integrate part of the act of programming***, preparing and reassuring, checked/coaching examples
vertical right: critique product-***finding inadequencies of a finished product***, 

## What is Quality?
1. value to some people
2. it can be political and emotional

## Quality in Business Fancing
1. Programmers need context, background, and tacit knowledge
2. To create story
   1. about the pacing of examples
   2. about the conversations around examples
   3. about the interaction between business-facing and technology-facing
   4. about how business-facing affects the architecture and design of the code
   5. about FIT (framework for integrated tests)
   6. about balancing examples and push the code forward
   7. about the distinction between checked detectors and checked examples
 
## business-facing product critiques
1. should be heavy on manipulation or approach the actual experience of different types of users
2. trying five kinds of exploratory testing
   1. one explaratory tester
   2. Pairs of exploratory testers
   3. Pairing an exploratory tester with a programmer on the project
   4. Pairing an exploratory tester with the on-project business expert
   5. Pairing an exploratory tester with interested non-participants ("chickens", in Scrum terminology) like executives, nearby users,   
      and so forth.
 3. explarotory testing: finding bugs & revealing bold new ideas

## technology-facing product critiques
1. finding security problems, performance problems, bugs that occur under load, usability problems
2. if necessary, finding specialists in these fields
