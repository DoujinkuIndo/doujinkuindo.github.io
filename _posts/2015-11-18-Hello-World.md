Not sure that there will be a whole ton of content here, but I'll likely start putting up any school/side projects I'm working on. Hopefully it will make them a little more comprehensible than just as a github repository with a readme file. And, who knows, maybe I'll start writing a little too. God knows I don't flex my longform muscles enough.

Anyway, more to come soon, I promise.
