In this panel with Tom Granot and Gary White Jr, we discuss:

* Optimizing costs across the engineering organization
* Handling tight deadlines with fewer working hands by increasing developer productivity
* Closing knowledge gaps due to developers departing the organization to reduce time to market
* Reducing MTTR (Mean Time To Resolve) even with a small on-call rotation
* Measuring the effectiveness of your processes and double down on what works
* And So Much More!
