## We laugh, we die, and we laugh again
 
 First I want to start with this video that's pretty much what was all this epic journey...

 I have to confess that I have **no frickin idea** of which places we visit, I was only a picture-asian-monkey, and also I'm really *bad with names*. So I can't be specific saying *tinkukurapomimu" it's an amazing place, also because that place doesn't exist, I think.
 
### The Raiders

In the eternal randomness of life we meet in **Blenheim**, with **Jeremy** working at the *pine trees* and he introduces **Jure** to the party (yeah like the *RPG parties*) at the beginning wasn't part of my plans to travel, not even now, but one day at the **best place of Blenheim**, Domino's, at that point my plan was, staying in Blenheim till they say me: 

> Sebastian we don't need you anymore

My thoughs

Till this couple of *pseudo humans* told me... **You can come with us in our ROAD TRIP, it will be really funny travel with you**

So yes, it's not because I'm a good person o anything like that, was only because **I CAN MAKE FUCKIN PEOPLE LAUGH**
fair enough, also it's true.
### DA TRIP
**Kiss kiss, good bye Blenheim** and we depart to **Nelson**, one of the Highlights of our self called **fury** road **trip** besides doing it fast, was, **Gold searching**

Of course we didn't find anything beside Sheeps, Lambs, Cows, and roads, a lot of damn long roads, well and Chicken in a can the best food you can buy for ~3 dollars.

After **Nelson** we went to **Greymouth**, or this it's what the *gps data* of my pictures says, and we stay for the first night in the **wilderness**, 3 guys in one tent for... 2 persons...

**Timaru** the best **Timaru** in the universe, and **Oamaru** a cool kind of old town that's really into **Steampunk** things.
