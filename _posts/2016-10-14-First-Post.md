title: This is my first Jekyll Blog!
---

I just want to make a blog post in the fastest and easiest way. Now, I don't understand much, but
in the future, it should be the best option for my business. _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
