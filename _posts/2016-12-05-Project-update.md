Finals week is among us! It's tough working on both the project and studying for finals, however,
Amina and I have made some strides in figuring out the research that needed to be involved in order 
reach the bottom of our research question. We adjucsted our claim to ask: which presidential candidate uses 
more pessimism in their tweets?

The original question was too biased based on what made a notion a bash or insult. Instead, we are 
using a program that notifies us the overall sentiment within a given phrase, or in our case, 3000 phrases.
Therefore, we simply have to measure the overall sentiment among the presidential candidates to figure out
which uses more pessimism, and display this using a carefully designed video.
