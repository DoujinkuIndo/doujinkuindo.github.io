The inaugural Cloud Native London meetup went smoothly, with myself as host and [Michael Hausenblas](https://twitter.com/mhausenblas) and [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/Ben_Hall) speaking.

There was great positive feedback about:

* My intro on why I founded the group and the four topics I want to hear about.
* "What does Cloud Native mean (to you?)" - Michael's discussion on the philosophy of Cloud Native.
* "The challenges of becoming cloud-native" - Ben's lightning demos on how to work with Kubernetes, Istio, Prometheus and more.
* The sliders, pastries and sandwiches. I enjoy interesting food, so it was never going to be just pizza!

My slides are available here:

Thanks to our sponsors, StorageOS, Sainsbury's, the CNCF and Tecknuovo, plus all the work that happened in the background to make it happen - reception, food prep and delivery, the AV crew, name tags, serving staff and cleaners.

Looking forward to [the next event in August](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London/events/240108222/)!
