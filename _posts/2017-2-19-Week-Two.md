# Completed Items this week

Day 1: [FCC][1] JavaScript catchup (Re-visted JavaScript section, completed Iterate with JavaScript For Loops through Nesting For Loops)

Day 2: Complete JavaScript section. (Iterate with JavaScript While Loops through Invert Regular Expression Matches with JavaScript)

Day 3: Start Object Oriented and Functional Programming (Declare JavaScript Objects as Variables through Make Object Properties Private)

Day 4: Complete Object Oriented and Functional Programming (Iterate over Arrays with .map through Join Strings with .join)

Day 5: Planning for the Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage basic front end development project. General layout idea added in [CodePen.io][2] and will continue this work in the next week or two to ensure each userstory is complete and the portfolio doesn't look like complete garbage.

Day 6: Start Basic Algorithm Scriptiong section.  I cleared Reverse a String and Factorialize a Number but the [Check for Palindromes][3] challenge and have been tripped up by the palindrome("_eye") and palindrome("0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0") requirements/tests.  I believe this is difficult for me because they are not palindromes but are supposed to report that they are...

Day 7: Setup GIT to sign commits via keybase.io

## Continual work/forward plans

- I'm still working to get more familiar with the GIT process (GitHub in particular).
- Create a list of other learning tools I find in this process.
- Get to [Confirm the Ending][4] challenge.
- Continue [Build a Professional Portfolio Webpage][5] development.
- Keep a running log in GitHub for this weekly post.
