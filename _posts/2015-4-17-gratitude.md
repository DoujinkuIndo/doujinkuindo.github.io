Gratitude is gold. Itis the transformative currency most easily exchanged for success and happiness. Gratitude is an expression of conscious awareness of our lives. It is not simply an emotion response, but also a choice. When gratitude becomes a habit of the heart, we can remain open to joy and possibility, regardless of what comes our way. Appreciate all that is good, take nothing for granted, invite your ego to step aside, and watch everything around you grow in ways you never could have imagined.
