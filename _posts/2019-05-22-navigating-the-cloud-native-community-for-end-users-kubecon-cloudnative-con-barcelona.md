* End users are organizations that use cloud native technology internally, but don't sell any cloud native services externally.

* The Cloud Native Computing Foundation helps end users to navigate the ecosystem, hire engineering talent, and align with cloud native.

* Joining as an [End User Supporter](https://www.cncf.io/endusersupporter) is cheaper than buying five KubeCon tickets.
