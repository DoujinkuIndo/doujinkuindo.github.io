At the start of Jan 18 I joined CarFinance 247 as Head of User Experience & Design. CarFinance 247 is made up of brilliant, passionate people who are great at what they do.

CarFinance 247 was set up in 2006 and has grown from 6 people to nearly 500. We are the market leader in Broker Finance and help thousands of people a month get car finance and their car. Also we have recently become a lender, actually lending our own money, it's a really exciting time.

One of the main goals/challenges for me was to instil design thinking within teams whilst setting up a first class UX team/structure. This takes time. Recruiting people is hard... maybe not hard but time consuming, no wait - actually it is hard.

>In my experience people are happier when given a problem to solve rather than told how to solve the problem.

Long gone, well hopefully they are, of design handing over a 'finished' set of files for developers to build from. Working in cross functional teams you work quicker, collaboratively. The perceived role of design has changed from the person sat in the corner bashing out designs, potentially getting stroppy if anyone questions a decision they've made, to a more collaborative type of animal.

Design is about solving problems. In my experience people are happier, more engaged thus producing 'better' work, when given a problem to solve rather than told how to solve the problem.

This is where UX testing can be so powerful. Currently while writing this I'm waiting for two great designers to join the team next week, actually by the time I've finished this draft and published they'll probably have been here a month... I digress.

>It's the easiest way to bring design thinking to a cross functional team

CarFinance 247 moves fast. We have an amazing team of engineers, data scientists, product owners etc etc and we are always releasing improvements. Often in companies designers can't be involved in everything and teams still need to release value. So how can you know how to improve your product/features with minimal design guidance? - you run a user experience testing session and let engineers, product owners, stakeholders see and understand the problems they need to fix.

>In all the years I've been working I've never heard anyone say observing a UX testing session was a waste of time - ever.

The thought of observing this isn't something that necessarily fills engineers with joy but in all the years I've been working I've never heard anyone say observing a UX testing session was a waste of time - ever. It acts as a lightbulb moment and allows non designers to ideate solutions to the problems. Some of these ideas may need some shaping by a more user focused person but it gets you a lot closer to a valuable user focused solution. It's the easiest way to bring design thinking to people who aren't used to user centred design.

## Car Finance 247's first user experience testing session

The impact UX testing can have was demonstrated when we ran our first days session. It broke down like this.

* We saw 5 people individually for an hour each who were looking for car finance
* They use their mobile phone online daily, shopping, Facebook etc
* A chat about their situation and thoughts around cars and finance
* They apply for car finance on our website
* They receive a call from one of our advisors
* We wrap up, the person is paid £50 and free to go
* The team breaks down their findings

This was the first full UX testing day and so I didn't want to focus on anything in-particular, just observe people going through the process.

To say this was eye opening for the team is an understatement. We saw people hit brick walls and not know what to do. We saw people tap something not expecting the consequence of what happened next. We found the answer to one technical bug we'd been struggling with and found another we didn't know we had. Being an organisation that hadn’t been exposed to user testing in the past, this opened up a whole new way at looking at the customer journey for everybody at CarFinance 247. The service we offer is clearly providing the right results but you don’t know how much room there is to iterate and develop your products until you see real-time customer interaction.  

If your company has never had any UX testing before the results you get can be massive. As you continue sometimes the results may not be quite so impactful but you will always get value and be able to iterate and improve your customer's experience.

Oh and by the way, I was correct, the designers have started.
