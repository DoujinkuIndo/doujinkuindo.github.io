# Moonrise Kingdom, Transcendental: Fresh Sorrow and Old Happiness

Moonrise Kingdom was... transcendental. At the risk of becoming one of those people who prefaces strong words with warnings that they're sparingly used and therefore carry enough weight to compensate for the linguistic treadmill that strong words often fall victim to, I don't often use the word transcendental. To me, that's a Peter Gabriel record, or a perfectly hazy summer night on a rooftop with a vague sense of purpose, or the first steps of fresh air after a long subway ride. I don't know what they have in common, but I know they're difficult to describe. They're not happy. They're not sad. They're very alive. Once I was on a train, by myself. Late December, bundled up tight, headphones on. Looking out the window at an unfamiliar landscape. It was nearly sunset, and the train station had been painted with yellows and purples and nothing of importance at all was said. But I remember it all the same. I don't know why. It seemed important, somehow. Maybe it was. _Moonrise Kingdom _is like that. It's an important chapter in the lives of these kids, and it's not really clear why. Certainly it's something that changes their lives; certainly it makes them better. But they remain at the end as stoic and emotionless and unflinching as they began it, whether they have love lost or love found. And the film begins as it ends, with a complacent, world-weary static that balances a fresh sorrow with an old happiness. The movie was nearly poetry. And it had a sense of childhood love which nobody could ever relate to. Children of the age depicted in the movie would have felt too young, and anyone older would have felt too old. But the on-screen romance was unpolluted by phone calls and text messages and parents. It was a character study. We don't have those any more. I don't know people except through their devices. And my transcendental moments are becoming fewer and fewer.
