# Round Here — Counting Crows

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAe3sCIakXo Another misplaces attachment to this song — I'm twenty-something, living in Boston, maybe, somewhere in the Northeast with warm buildings and a cold outdoors, maybe I'm postgrad or working, doesn't matter — I have a vision of just _malaise_, maybe from Good Will Hunting, and I'm not unhappy but I'm incomplete, the music's emptiness and the winter and this weird distant city, not my own New York but somewhere _else_; I go to concerts and the shows reflect it; it's a college town, but the college rock bands play 90s music, my god, I wasn't even alive in the 90s; this isn't my dream, this is somebody else's; this is the plot of Portlandia, except they're thrilled with it, and I'm dreaming; maybe this was a dream I had on that trip to Philadelphia? And this is the song — a complete life, cohesive and not without its benefits, but not mine, not mine at all.
