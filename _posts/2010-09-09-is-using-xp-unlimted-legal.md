This is a question I've been asked, and I've seen a multitude of opinions out there on the wild wild web.

Thus I thought I'd share my findings.

First of all, what is XP Unlimited?

>XP Unlimited turns your Windows System into a full blown Terminal Server, without any limit. XP Unlimited gives you eXtra Productivity when using Microsoft Windows.

It is meant to turn your XP machine into the equivilant of a terminal server machine without the expense of spending money on Terminal Server CALs (Client Access Licenses)

Thus the question, is this legal? is it legit?

The document on the Microsoft Site (MS Word format) found here:

[http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/5/695ba00d-c790-4c90-813a-f10539d97991/Licensing%20Windows%20Server%202008%20Terminal%20Services.doc](http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/5/695ba00d-c790-4c90-813a-f10539d97991/Licensing%20Windows%20Server%202008%20Terminal%20Services.doc) (Full URL included for the sceptics).

Now this document is about Windows Server 2008, but it makes three points that I feel are important:

- Is this a change from Windows Server 2003 licensing? No.
- Do I need a TS CAL if I am using a third-party technology like Citrix XenApp, Ericom PowerTerm WebConnect, Quest Virtual Access Suite, GraphOn Go-Global, etc. to directly or indirectly access the server software to interact with the graphical user interface? Yes.
- Note: WindowsÂ® client operating system (OS) license terms do not permit multiple users to access or otherwise use more than one licensed copy of the software simultaneously.

I would put XP Unlimited into this same category as these products.

So if you were to use XP Unlimited on an XP Pro machine, I would feel that invokes the third point above, if you where to use XP Unlimited on a Server 2003 machine then you would still require TS CALs, so I wouldn't need XP Unlimited.

What do you think?
