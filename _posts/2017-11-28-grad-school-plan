title: My plan for grad school
---

Going into undergrad, it was obvious I was going to do either computer science or mechanical engineering.
I wanted to do robotics, but wasn't very interested in the E.E. side of things (turns out I like it more than I thought I would).
I ended up majoring in M.E. for a simple reason: I could minor in C.S., but not M.E..
So now I'm thinking about grad school and I'm realizing I'd like to explore the more R&D side of things, which leans C.S. heavy.

Enter Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. 
It's an online masters in C.S..
It's from a great univeristy.
It has a robotics and computer vision specialization.
It's cheap.
I'm in.

So, I'm changing my self learning plans. 
Before, I had been using [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu)'s computer science and data science curriculums to pick classes to take and things to learn.
To be the best applicant possible, I'm going to change to a much more focused list of classes.

| Topic | Class | 
| ----- | --------- |
| Git/Github | [How to use Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) |
| C Refresh | [Modern C](https://github.com/mattboler/ModernC) |
| Java Refresh | [Software Construction: Data Abstraction](https://www.edx.org/course/software-construction-data-abstraction-ubcx-softconst1x) |
| Python Refresh | [Introduciton to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11) |
| Math Refresh | [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm) |
| AI Introduction | [Intro to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271) |
| Operating Systems Introduction | [Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) |

I'm already working on the C refresher. 
I'm also taking a Diff Eq refresh to prepare for the spring, and edx's robotics micromasters for fun. 
After I finish the Diff Eq refresh, I'll cut down to two classes at a time.
