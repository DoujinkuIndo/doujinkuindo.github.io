Kinda feel like I&#8217;ve been hit by a truck at the moment. Head is congested as anything and my nose won&#8217;t stop running so I&#8217;m currently dosing up on cold and flu tablets.

It has probably been brought on by the long and ridiculously hot days here in Denver but I&#8217;ve been having a pretty good time. Warped Tour was good fun, mid afternoon showers helped to cool the day down a bit, and the whole show wound up by about 8pm or so. Don&#8217;t think I could have held out much longer anyway, even if I tried.

Bands I saw:  
Fake Problems  
Parkway Drive  
Anti-Flag  
Reel Big Fish  
Andrew WK  
Dillinger Escape Plan  
Terrible Things  
Of Mice And Men  
Far From Finished  
The Casualties  
Suicide Silence  
Set Your Goals  
The Jukebox Romantics  
Riverboat Gamblers  
Dropkick Murphys  
Alkaline Trio  
Face To Face  
Pennywise  
Every Time I Die

Highlights included ETID covering Tourettes (Nirvana) and Bill Stevenson doing backup vocals on Pennwise&#8217;s &#8216;Society&#8217;.

    Also learned Chuck Ragan was doing a set later that night at Only Thunder&#8217;s farewell show. $8, I couldn&#8217;t argue with that&#8230; The first 2 bands were pretty lame, Chuck was decent (and even brought Tim from Rise Against out to sing on one song). I wanted to see Only Thunder but it was already midnight by the time Chuck finished and as I mentioned I&#8217;ve been feeling pretty dodgy.

    Leaving for Albuquerque tonight, going to be in the deep south for the best part of the next week or so. But for now I&#8217;m about to go to the movies to kill some time (I have 5.5 hours before the bus leaves). Here&#8217;s one last picture of Denver:
