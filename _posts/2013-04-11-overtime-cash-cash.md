# Overtime — Cash Cash

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85ftfVUTzM4 I don't care about any of this song past the 0:08 mark, but let's talk about the first eight seconds. The subtle swell out of dimness, raising into the treble as the drums hit, giving a sense of rhythm, the simple riff already, at the 0:04 second mark, already varying, playing off itself, subverting whatever tiny expectations we've built in the four second the song's been on — not even — until the hit at the end, showing that this was a precoda, the introduction to a song, like candy before a meal. And the rest of the song doesn't disappoint, but... damn, those first eight seconds.
