title: How programming can help solve (almost) all your problems
---

Today I had a short talk with the students at my old high school in Slovakia.

We talked about informatics, data and the students' views on its use in modern society.
I strongly feel that programming will find its place in a lot of workplaces even outside of
software engineering. We discussed their ideas, which I tried to illustrate by showing
them some cool examples related to software popping up in unexpected places.

You can take a quick look at [the slides]({{site.url}}/talks/2016_gymy.pdf), but unfortunately, they're only in Slovak.

At the end, I presented my proof-of-concept idea of teaching a voluntary extra-curricular Intro to Computer Science course.
I'll post more information about this later, if someone [signs up](https://goo.gl/forms/OsDEQGVMwZTZ1HZh2) :)

P.S.: Check out the talk I did [last year]({{site.url}}/Math-popularization-talk-at-gymy/).
