## Summary
I implemented the Python GUI program using PyQt4. It was the first time I had implemented gui in Python. In addition, the system is constructed by applying MVC pattern and observer pattern. 

## Environment
+ Python 3.5
+ PyQt4

## Project duration
2016.5.1 ~ 2015.8.27

## Main Text
In short, this program parses the articles on the Cyber Response System website and generates the resulting files. The UML diagram used in the design is as follows.

Until now, I have never had a chance to design a program directly. I was able to learn many things by designing using various design patterns. Because it was made in the army, it contains military confidentiality. So I could not upload the source code.
