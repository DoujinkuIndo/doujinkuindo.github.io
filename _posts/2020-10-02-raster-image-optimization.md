## Homework
1. Review
    - [First Contentful Paint (FCP) and First Meaningful Paint (FMP) Explained](https://www.acmethemes.com/blog/first-contentful-paint-and-first-meaningful-paint/)
    - Reference: [Image file type and format guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types)
2. Sample images: 
    - Find 5 or more images that you've taken or designed so we can optimize their file size. 
    - _Do not_ use Lorem Picsum (or similar services) since these images are probably already optimized.
    - Try to find diverse image types such as photos, logos, graphic design, etc.
3. Image Formats and Compression
    - Watch: [Image compression deep-dive](https://youtu.be/F1kYBnY6mwg) by Jake and Surma
    - Read: [`picture`] element
4. Image `width` and `height` attributes
    - Read: [Setting Height And Width On Images Is Important Again](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/setting-height-width-images-important-again/)
    - Watch: [Do This to Improve Image Loading on Your Website](https://youtu.be/4-d_SoCHeWE)

4. Complete two performance audits on your project page using Chrome Lighthouse: once with the original image file and a second with the optimized image file.

## 2. Supporting alternate image formats with the `picture` element

## 3. Image `width` and `height` attributes
