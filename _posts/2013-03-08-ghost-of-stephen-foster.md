# Ghost of Stephen Foster — Squirrel Nut Zippers

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sxFyu_U2go Genres don't always stay dead. Swing died off after about the 50s, but, like the Cat in the Hat, it came back. The musical subculture, accompanied by dance, made a resurgence in the late 90s in places like L.A. and New York, as [neo-swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDWtWNwNUjk) — mostly pioneered by bands like [Squirrel Nut Zippers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uiYp8xKjLM), with some modern work done by bands like [Caravan Palace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sBZdSHAIZI), who do _electroswing_, which is absolutely wonderful. Enjoy the above video, (action starts at 0:34) done in the style of [Minnie The Moocher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaZOXF83zBg), the famous 1930s Betty Boop cartoon with music by, and starring a rotoscoped, [Cab Calloway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8yGGtVKrD8). Note the scene in which three ghosts voluntarily electrocute themselves, as well as the dancing walrus. Thanks, 1930s.
