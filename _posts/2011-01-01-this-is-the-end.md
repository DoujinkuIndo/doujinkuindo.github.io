Almost everything that occurred had a pretty large degree of being unplanned or straying from how it was meant to turn out, and it still wound up being a much better year than I could have imagined. I have to say the &#8216;winging it&#8217; approach to life has been working out pretty good for me.

If you didn&#8217;t take the hint, I&#8217;m not coming home anytime soon.
