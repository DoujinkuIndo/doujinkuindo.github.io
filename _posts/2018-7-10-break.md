Awesome! Generally I'm super happy to travel and speak, especially for keynotes and if you can provide support for travel costs.

Recently I've had to turn down a lot of speaking invitations, so figured I should explain the hiatus. At the end of August I will marry my brilliant partner, Nick. He's a software engineer at Google and [writes about machine learning frameworks and iOS development](https://harveynick.com].

This means that I'm focus on wedding planning, so I can't commit to any speaking engagements until that's done. If you're looking for a speaker from mid-September onwards, [tweet me](https://twitter.com/oicheryl).

Back shortly
