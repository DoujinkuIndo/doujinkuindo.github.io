Thanks also to our sponsors [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Contino](https://www.contino.io/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/),  [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com), and [D2iQ](https://d2iq.com).

First up, Grant Schofield from Humio discussed being Stateful in a Stateless Land (starting at [50:29](https://youtu.be/M8HnRvYZ05c?t=3029)). His takeaways are that:

* Running stateful systems in Kubernetes doesnâ€™t require you use StatfulSets, alternative approaches such deployments may be better for your stateful workload.
* Understanding the consistency needs of your application and employing other systems, such as Kafka and cloud storage, allows for orchestrating complex workloads in a stateless way.
* Architecting your applications to take advantage of cloud native principles can allow for more flexible approaches to deploying, managing, and running your applications.


Next up, Kevin Chen from Kong told us about Building a Modern Architectures with Service Mesh with Envoy (starting at [1:17:11](https://youtu.be/M8HnRvYZ05c?t=4631)). His takeaways will be posted once available.

Finally,  Rob de Canha-Knight from SUSE wrapped up our evening by discussing An open source visual user experience for Cloud Native Platforms (starting [2:02:57](https://youtu.be/M8HnRvYZ05c?t=7377)). He summed it up in these points:

* Kubernetes is incredibly developer focused and heavily API driven. CLI tools are not necessarily easy for everyone in an organisation to use.
* Stratos is a vendor agnostic tool to manage multiple Kubernetes (and Cloud Foundry) environments, running in any cloud.
* While easy to use for developers, it also allows operations staff to manage applications at scale in an easy way, while enabling line of business views into critical security vulnerabilities or best practice tweaks that can be made.
