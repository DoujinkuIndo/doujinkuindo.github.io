This post like a lucky three leaf clover comes to you in three parts.

##Part 1: We're shipping what, where now?

  To ship is to support a romantic relationship. It's when you pair two people together that you want to be in a relationship. The term ship is commonly thought to be the shorthand for the word relationship. This is especially popularized in fan culture. It is rare now a tv show or movie without multiple ships, and ship names.
  
##Part 2: What's in a name?

  Believe it or not there is an actual science behind all the shipping names. It's not just someone making up the names of the top of their head. I mean there someone doing that but there are specific reasons why some ship names stick over their alternative madeup name.
  
  Overlap: Occurs when names have an overlapping common sound, but one of the sounds overrides the other.
  Examples:  Grindelwald and Dumbledore becomes Grindeldore (or Dumblewald) with the over lapping "I" sound. Rumbelle is a near overlap with the "bl-" from Belle evoking the "pl-" from Rumplestiltskin. Ruffy or Briley comes from Riley and Buffy which uses the same ending sound to overlap the names.

  Orthographic Transparency:

  Lexical Neighbourhood Evaluation: Occurs when other words sound close to the ship name.
  Examples: Pepper's and Tony's ship name is Pepperony which sounds like pepperoni.

  When it doesn't work: Last names or other descriptive words about the characters are used to create the ship name.
  Examples: SwanQueen is Emma and Evil Queen Regina Mills ship name. Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Bruce Banner become Star-Spangled Banner.

##Part 3: This is digital Humanitites?
