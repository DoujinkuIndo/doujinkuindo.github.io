This post like a lucky three leaf clover comes to you in three parts.

##Part 1: We're shipping what, where now?

  To ship is to support a romantic relationship. It's when you pair two people together that you want to be in a relationship. The term ship is commonly thought to be the shorthand for the word relationship. This is especially popularized in fan culture. It is rare now a tv show or movie without multiple ships, and ship names.
  
##Part 2: What's in a name?

  Believe it or not there is an actual science behind all the shipping names. It's not just someone making up the names of the top of their head. I mean there someone doing that but there are specific reasons why some ship names stick over their alternative madeup name.
  
  
  
##Part 3: This is digital Humanitites?
