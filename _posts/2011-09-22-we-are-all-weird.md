Seth Godin has a new book out called "We Are All Weird", to quote:>The bell curve is spreading, normal isn't what it used to be and the age of mass is over.

We've lived with mass all our lives, and now it's gone. What are you going to do about it?

How much longer will we isolate and denigrate people because they don't fit our mass-market definition of the way people should choose to act?
