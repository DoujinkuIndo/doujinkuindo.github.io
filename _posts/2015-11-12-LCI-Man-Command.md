The oldest English-language use of the proverb has been found in Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie's (1837–1919) novel, Mrs. Dymond (1885), in a slightly different form:

<pre>"I don't suppose even Caron could tell you the difference between material and spiritual," said Max, shrugging his shoulders. "He certainly doesn't practise his precepts, but I suppose the Patron meant that <strong>if you give a man a fish he is hungry again in an hour. If you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn.</strong> But these very elementary principles are apt to clash with the leisure of the cultivated classes. Will Mr. Bagginal now produce his ticket—the result of favour and the unjust sub-division of spiritual environments?" said Du Parc, with a smile.</pre>

The proverb has been attributed to many others, but no good evidence has been produced.

And the most commonly used version is of course

<pre>give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime</pre>

If you don't have the time to practice unix terminal commands then I strongly suggest that you learn at least the "man" command...

<pre><code>man</code></pre>
