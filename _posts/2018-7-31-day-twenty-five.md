I'm finally caught up on my laptop. I have all the data and PSFs I need, I got DOLPHOT to compile, and have all of the commands I need all on my personal computer. It took a fresh installation of Windows, but I actually don't mind that; my computer feels quick. Unfortunately, that took most of the day itself, and my attempts at running DOLPHOT left me in exactly the same place as yesterday. I went back to MAST and downloaded the data as flc and drc this time, but the same issues keep coming up. I tried running just `splitgroups` on the drc stuff, but that hasn't helped so far. Maybe one of the extensions is useful, but after struggling I can't find which one.

# Conclusion
I wish I had more to say about today, but almost all of the work was in catching my laptop up to where I am on the Mac. But, that's done now, and I was able to spend some time trying to get further with DOLPHOT. At this point, though, I'm just confused as to what is even going wrong, so haven't made it very far.
