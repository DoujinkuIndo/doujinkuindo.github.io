I've updated my SQL Reporting Services and Dynamics NAV Option Strings solution to version v2.00.00 which will work with 2013. Â Updated some of the code/syntax (which was quite ugly looking at it years later) and updated the report from classic, with an RDL layout. \[embed\]https://github.com/eknraw/SSRS-Dynamics-NAV-Option-Strings\[/embed\]
