I'm releasing my third album, **Astral Logical**, as **Taylor J Hawkins**, in **February, 2022**. 
It will be available on Spotify, ITunes, and other digital distribution platforms. 
The material was recorded this past year (2021), with [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), my current DAW, in my home studio.

The original intention of this album was to take a step towards a metal sound with the nylon guitar. Instead it became a blend of thoughtful instrumental composition and more alternative themed songs. I was also happy to incorporate the fretless guitar in places.

The microphone used for the album was an [S-87](https://microphone-parts.com/collections/microphone-kits/products/s87-microphone-kit) that I soldered together from MicParts. 

**Album List:**  
- Prelude
- Astral Logical
- Ever After
- Interlude
- Aflame
- Postlude
