I really enjoyed recording this podcast with Kunal Parmar, Director of Engineering at Box, on their journey towards Kubernetes. Co-hosted with Ken Owens from Mastercard and Alex Williams from The New Stack.

> Online storage management company Box was one of the first companies to build on Kubernetes. Initially creating its platform on PHP, Box’s architecture still uses some parts of the PHP architecture. Today, Box serves as a case study of a software platform’s cloud native journey. The company also continues to rely on its legacy infrastructure dating back to the days when PHP ran on Box’s bare metal servers in its data centers.
