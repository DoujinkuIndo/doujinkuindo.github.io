# One Man Wrecking Machine — Guster

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxyw3Ew5LGw Dad folk, dad rock, full of regrets and symbolism, striving to justify its own existence, careful and measured and inventive, but not music with nothing to lose — this is rock by and for a crowd that isn't free to experiment. And the song reflects that — the song _is_ nostalgia, weird and cute and sad and whatever, this is the way it is. A younger person would look back and say — no, this was wrong, I can fix this, I can do better next time. But I get the sense from these guys that it's just longing — they wouldn't _want_ to change anything. They've become complacent, they've become happy with their lives, warts and all, and while they may _like_ thinking about the past, it's just a pasttime, a hobby, not a fixation, an obsession.
