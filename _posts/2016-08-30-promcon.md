Last week, I was fortunate enough to be invited to speak alongside an old friend, [Chris Urwin](https://twitter.com/containerschris) at [Promcon](http://promcon.io/) in sunny Berlin. Promcon 2016 was the inaugural Conference for all things Prometheus,for those of you unfamiliar with Prometheus, it’s in essence a queryable metrics store built-upon a time series database.

Sounds interesting, but why would you need such a thing? Prometheus is a powerful tool, able to store multi-dimensional data and search it efficiently through PromQL, i'ts custom built query language. From where i'm standing, Prometheus is one of a number of new generation monitoring tools that have recently come of age.

These are the tools that will help us *finally* deliver the quality of monitoring we’ve not often enjoyed.

# The confrence

Spanning two days, we heard from a fantastic selection of speakers, all eager to share their experiences and to learn from the wider community. We had great examples at scale from the likes of SoundCloud and DigitalOcean, demonstrating how Prometheus can be used at absolutely massive scale, we also had some equally important talks from companies like Shuttlecloud who’ve been able to take Prometheus and drop it straight into their platforms with great success. 

Of the talks, I have to say my personal favourite was Björn Rabenstein's talk about how Prometheus stores and handles data. It’s something he’s clearly passionate about and it’s fascinating when engineering is taken to such high levels of optimisation. I’d highly recommend watching his talk and many of the others available to view online at the links below.

The conference offered fascinating insight into how successful open source project can be run and importantly, how you can engage the wider community in the ongoing development of the product. For me personally, the focused nature of the conference allowed for a greater level of detail to be explored, making it very useful, even for the more experienced attendees.

# Our expereince

So how did we come about Prometheus? We first discovered Prometheus when one of my colleagues was on the hunt for something simple yet powerful that could be leveraged to monitor a proof of concept build we undertook for one of our clients. The POC its-self, based around Docker and a container management & orchestration tool called Rancher. 

After some positive initial feedback, I started to get involved and explore Prometheus further. One thing led to another, before you know it we had contributed a catalog entry available in the Rancher community catalog. In this catalog item was a collection of modern open source tools you could one click deploy to dynamically monitor your platform. This proved popular, with now over 10 thousand downloads, we have also had over 50 thousand downloads alone of a plugin we wrote to make the Rancher API scriptable by Prometheus.

# Further Info

[Brian Brazil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbrazil), one of the founders of Prometheus, heads up consultancy called [Robust Perception](http://www.robustperception.io/), offering training and consultancy around Prometheus, he also runs a highly useful blog that goes into detail around the different features Prometheus has to offer. 

Brian’s been kind enough to agree to talk at our offices in Leeds, if your in Leeds on the 13th of October and want to drop by for his talk, get in-touch at ed@infinityworks.com and i’ll make sure we reserve a seat for you!
