The old (and extremely cheap and dodgy) record player I had died. I&#8217;d been meaning to upgrade for a while, but now I had no real choice. Since the old one had a preamp built in it didn&#8217;t even cross my mind to consider a preamp, so obviously I get it home and I can&#8217;t get any sound out of my stereo.

Today I go buy the preamp and power supply for it, take it home and all that happens is a loud hum/buzz and then nothing. Take the power supply back to the store to realise I had bought a AC supply instead of DC. A couple of facepalms later I get it all up and running.

Why did I not buy a good record player earlier? The sound is divine.
