**What innovation could RPG groups most benefit from?**

Well here's an interesting topic. Two main technologies come to mind: VR, and Holographic Projection. How better become immersed in the fictional worlds we play in? Of course both would take a lot of time and money invested to properly work, and in my opinion would take away from one of the main reasons to play RPGs. That reason? To unplug with some friends and enjoy some low-tech fun.

There's something charming about pencil and paper RPGs. Physically rolling dice, flipping pages to look up rules/charts, constantly updating a character sheet with various items, stats, etc...

You know what would be great? Something like the [Noteslate](http://noteslate.com) preloaded with character sheets, maps, and books.
