One of the greatest things about Tak is the open nature of the game. Cheapass Games provides the [rules](http://cheapass.com/node/215) online, along with piece dimensions. People all over have been making their own Tak sets, and some of them are just awe inspiring. I've started keeping a [Pinterest Board](https://www.pinterest.com/rkalajian/tak/) with sets I like, but I figured I'd spotlight a few here.

Posted by reddit user [Shidda](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shiddha), this board is simple, functional, and beautiful.  Simple wooden pieces on a stitched board.

Flickr user [TevK](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tevk/) created two different board with two different techniques. He provides instructions for both [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tevk/27171427796/in/photostream/).

Next is a really beautiful boxed set created by a reddit user that I can't seem to find again (apologies!)

Finally, my absolute favorite. Imgurian [AaronSchmersal](http://imgur.com/user/AaronSchmersal) created a board that's both beautiful and thematic, using characteristics taken from the Kingkiller Chronciles.

I'm still struggling to make a set that I'm happy with, but I don't even have a fraction of the talent these fine folk have. I'll just have to settle with what I have until the official sets come out in November.
