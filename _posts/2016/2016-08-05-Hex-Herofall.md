Gameforge and HEX Entertainment have announced HEX's upcoming fifth set, [“Herofall”](http://en.hex.gameforge.com/news.html?p=7711). The latest card set brings an additional 275 new cards to HEX: Shards of Fate, and is slated for release this fall. Alongside the new cards, we will see the first tournament based on the newly introduced ladder system in the “Cosmic Crown Showdown”.

Cosmic Crown Showdown pits all the players who have reached the Cosmic tier against each other, with the top 64 from both the constructed and limited ladders being able to participate. Finalists are expected to be announced in August, with the first  Cosmic Crown Showdown starting in September.

As for the new set, 18 legendary cards and 20 new champions will be introduced, along with new sleeves. The conflict between HEX’s two factions—between the Ardent and the Underworld—will be in the spotlight for the new troops, actions and heroes.
