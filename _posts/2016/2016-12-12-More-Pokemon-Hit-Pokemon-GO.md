New Pokémon arrive today in Pokémon GO, including Togepi, Pichu, and several more select Pokémon from the Johto region. These new Pokémon can only be hatched from eggs, so make sure you hit up all your favorite Pokéstops to fill up on the hatchables. Thanks to several all-new Pokémon GO promotional partnerships, such as one with Sprint in the US, more than 10,500 Sprint and Boost Mobile and Sprint at RadioShack locations have turned into PokéStops and Gyms.

There's also a new Pikachu in town. Donning a festive Santa hat and available to capture until December 29, 2016, 11:00 A.M. PST.
