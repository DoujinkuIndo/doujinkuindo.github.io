[Acquire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire) has changed hands quite a bit in its history. It's been in the hands of Hasbro since 1999 when they first published it under their newly-acquires (pun intended) Avalon Hill brand. Acquire has gone from a more functional to a more visually pleasing transition over the years, but the basic gameplay has stayed the same.

Now Hasbro has a new version on the market that has its own unique look and feel to it. It's very minimal, yet still striking. Very plastic/cheap cardstock, but not to much detriment.

Take a look for yourself and see how you feel about it. Then go out and snag it because it's the cheapest you'll find this classic game that deserves a spot on every gamer's shelf.
