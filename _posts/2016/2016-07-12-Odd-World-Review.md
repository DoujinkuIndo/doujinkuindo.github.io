It's a small, inexpensive card game with easy-to-learn rules, but with a little bit more than you'd expect from a kids' title like this.

The goal of the game is simple: have the most points when the cards run out. Look a little deeper and you'll see there's a bit more to it. To earn points you need to have sets of matching planets. Not only that, but your sets have to have an odd number of cards to actually score. Have four planet Earth cards? That's worth zero points. Have three, or five? You're good to go.

The cards are set up in two equal piles at the start of the game. Each card back features two different planets. Only one of those planets is on the flip side. Players need to pick a card from one of the piles, decide to keep it or give it to another player, then the card is revealed. It's a balancing act trying to keep your sets of odd numbers while trying to even out other players' sets. In the end, it's really quite fun.

I've played Odd World with my 10-year-old, 9-year-old, and 6-year-old. They all enjoy the game, especially because it's so easy for them to take out, set up, and play on their own. It's a game I can play without cringing when they suggest it.

My only complaint? It would have been really nice to have different planetary facts on each card. It wouldn't make or break anything, but it would have been a great touch to an excellent kids game.
