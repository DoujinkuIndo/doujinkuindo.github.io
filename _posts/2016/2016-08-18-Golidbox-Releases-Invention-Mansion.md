We're huge fans of [Goldieblox](http://www.goldieblox.com) in our house. For those who don't know, Goldieblox puts out STEM-related products focused at girls in the form of building and invention sets. We've got a few sets ranging from a simple zipline to a zoetrope animation studio. Everything they do has been thought of from the ground up. Building manuals are written in the form of stories, or as build diaries written by the various Goldieblox characters. Pieces are sturdy and colorful, never straying far from anything but their functional use.

Now Goldieblox is releasing their version of the dollhouse. Called the [Invention Mansion](http://www.goldieblox.com/products/invention-mansion), it's over 350 pieces that will give kids the power to build the house however they please. An included manual is filled with ideas to get them started, and there's tons of fun features to add into the mansion like a trap door, zipline, balcony, bridges, levers, linkages, climbing wall, and more.

The Invention Mansion is up for a [limited pre-sale](http://www.goldieblox.com/products/invention-mansion) for $60 right now. It looks amazing, and I'm sure out kids will be digging into this set at soon as it arrives.
