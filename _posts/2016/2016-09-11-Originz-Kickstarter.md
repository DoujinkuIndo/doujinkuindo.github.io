My first September Kickstarter pick is a game I'm a huge fan on. [ORIGINZ: The Superpowered Card Game](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flavorfaction/originz-the-superpowered-card-game/comments) is a self-contained card battling game with 12 different superpower decks. I've already done a [Kickstarter Preview](http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/09/kickstarter-preview-originz-the-superpowered-card-game/) for the game on Purple Pawn and have [streamed the game live](http://pawnsperspective.com/Originz-Tabletop-Simulator/) over Tabletop Simulator with one of the game's designers, Evan.

The best part? The game is already funded. Pledge $40 to get your own copy, and that includes shipping. There's also a $79 pledge level that gets your play mats for the game. Now all that needs to be done is to help Flavor Faction raise even more to include some great stretch goals, like increased card quality and Cosmic Powers.
