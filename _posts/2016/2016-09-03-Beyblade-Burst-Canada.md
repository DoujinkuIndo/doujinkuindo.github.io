Bey Brad over at the World Beyblade Organization has posted [some pics](https://worldbeyblade.org/Thread-Hasbro-s-Beyblade-Burst-OUT-in-Canada-First-Photos-LOTS-of-images) of Beyblade Burst on shelves in Canada. Toronto, Ontario, to be exact.

We should be seeing them in the states soon, but it's exciting to see English releases already. Of course there's some difference already being spotted, like Hasbro's Beys [not having teeth](https://worldbeyblade.org/Thread-Hasbro-s-Beyblade-Burst-Energy-Layers-have-no-teeth-bursting-is-rare-UPDATED) on the Energy Layers. Instead there's solid, sloped incline. This makes the parts incompatible with Takara-Tomy Burst parts. So far the Bursting effect seems uneffected, but the WBO will be conducting more tests.

I keep following up with my Hasbro PR rep in hopes to get a handful of Beys to test out, take pics of, and report on. More when I have it.
