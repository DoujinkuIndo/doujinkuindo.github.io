The other night I sat down with Evan from Flavor Faction to play their super hero card game, [Originz](http://www.originzthegame.com/card-types#!/page/418080/about-flavor-faction). I had a chance to play this back during CT FIG, but this time I got to play over Tabletop Simulator to check out the [implementation](steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=718481315&searchtext=Originz).

How does it play? Really well. All the cards look great, and the game plays like you'd expect. Evan and I had a great match, trading blows back and forth for quite some time before I finally slipped up and he got the upper hand. I'll be posting a more indepth view of the game once Flavor Faction launches their Kickstarter. Until then, you can snag the module for TTS [here](steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=718481315&searchtext=Originz). You'll also need the [rulebook](http://image9.photobiz.com/3850/20160708080528_214270.pdf), and you may want to watch the [How to Play Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0APCBxQQeE&feature=youtu.be).

You'll need a copy of [Tabletop Simulator](http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160), which costs $20 on Steam.

Here's some screenshots from the game:
