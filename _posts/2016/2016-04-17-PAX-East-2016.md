It's that time of year again! On Friday I'll be heading to PAX East, this time for the full 3 days. I've already got a lot of appointments lined up with various game companies, and I'll be wandering the tabletop area on the lookout for cool and exciting things. Of course, being there longer than I usually am, I'll be looking to play more games!

If you're going to be at the show, gimme a shout on [Twitter ](http://twitter.com/rkalajian) if you're up for a game or have something new to show.
