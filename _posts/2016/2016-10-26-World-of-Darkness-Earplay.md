I hadn't heard of [Earplay](http://ear-play.com) before today. Earplay is currently available as a skill on Alexa Enabled devices, and enables you to play games via voice and audio on said devices.

Earplay and White Wolf today announced a new partnership to create a full length interactive audio experience scheduled to release this winter through Alexa and iOS. This will be the first immersive digital experience set in the World of Darkness universe. A free interactive audio teaser titled “The Orpheus Device” will be available soon through signup in the Earplay Alexa skill and in November in the Earplay iOS App.

The Orpheus Device is written and designed by Dave Grossman (Day of the Tentacle, The Wolf Among Us) and game writer Richard Dansky (The Division), the original developer of the Wraith tabletop game (my favorite WoD setting.) Players will hear the story, interact with the characters, and become immersed in the narrative through this exciting new medium.

“As we are developing the World of Darkness it is very inspiring to work with Earplay about how to bring our universe into the new medium of interactive audio storytelling,” said White Wolf CEO Tobias Sjögren. “The way you can now interact with a story fits the Wraith brand extremely well and we think Earplay has a unique ability to make an immersive experience for the players,” said White Wolf Lead Storyteller Martin Ericsson.

The teaser should be available on Halloween and has the player conversing with a Wraith by using their Alexa enabled device as an Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) device built by the ghost hunting organization Orpheus.

Being a World of Darkness property, it's safe to say it's not suitable for children.
