**What makes a good character?**

The player makes a good character.

I'm not just talking about assigning stats, creating the backstory, etc... It's all about how the player actually *plays* their character. Even the most tired tropes and cliches can be great when in the hands of a good player. What makes a good player is hard to describe, but you always know when you've got one. A good player/character helps the game flow, making the story a more of a living entity as time goes on. They roll with the GM, helping to shape the campaign.
