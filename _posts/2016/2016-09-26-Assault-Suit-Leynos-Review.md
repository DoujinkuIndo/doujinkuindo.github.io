<h2>Prelude</h2>

If you haven't guessed my now I'm a huge fan of interactive fiction, so when I was offered a review copy of Out There Chronicles I didn't hesitate the download it to my phone and give it a whirl. The game is set in the same universe as Out There, a different interactive sci-fi graphic novel was written by FibreTigre. It's a choose-your-own-adventure style game with beautiful artwork and an eerie soundtrack.

<h2>Play</h2>

Gameplay is super simple and very minimal. As you read through the game you'll be presented with a set of options. Choose the one you want by tapping on it and the story continues. Sometimes a scene will play out and present you with some of the previous options, and sometimes there'll be a scene change or new options that open up to you.

Sometimes you'll die.

Out There Chronicles, while sometimes a bit linear, doesn't hold your hand. There're times where your actions will get you into trouble. There're times where your actions will get you killed. In that case, you'll be whisked away back to a checkpoint where you'll have to play several scenes over again in hopes that you don't mess up as badly again.

It's a laid back experience where the story is first and foremost a part of the game. Different choices will lead to different outcomes and will always have a great bit of fiction to go along with them. Watching events unfold around you is satisfying.

The artwork in Out There Chronicles is fantastic. All the illustrations are done by renowned artist Benjamin Carr√©, a man known for his work in science fiction. Siddhartha Barnhoorn provides the haunting music that accompanies the story and helps give emotion to the various scenes in the game.

All the artwork is still frame, and it works perfectly as to no distract from the story, but to enhance it. Text boxes are colored in a way so you can easily tell which characters are speaking, and what's descriptive text. All this combined with a simple UI make for an overall pleasant experience.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

I'm a huge of the game. Out There Chronicles provides the pleasure of a good piece of science fiction with the excitement of old-school choose-your-own-adventure books. It's just the right length to keep you hooked without dragging on to the point where you lose interest.

This is just the first episode of a longer storyline, and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the next episode. If you're interested in the game it's currently on sale for 99 cents in both the Google Play and iTunes stores. I'd snag it now if I were you, though the game is still worth every penny of its full price.
