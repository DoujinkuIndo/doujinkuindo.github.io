Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. (KONAMI) announced today that Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist is now available on PC Steam in the Americas and Europe, marking the first time the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise is available for the popular PC platform.

Newcomers players can hone their skills courtesy of the gameâ€™s accessible tutorial, while veteran players can dive into the rich Story Campaign and Duel with more than 90 characters, customize their Decks on the fly with a new Deck Editor, and compete with other Duelists online in new Battle Pack Sealed Deck and Draft play. Nine new sets of add-on content are also available bringing the total card pool to more than 7,400 cards. Each set is based off the TV series: Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, and Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V, and includes a single-player story Duel, two complete Decks played by the characters in the Duel, and a character avatar.
