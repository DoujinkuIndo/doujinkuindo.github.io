[Aurora](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/aurora1) is a game about the evolution of a solar system that was entered into The Game Crafter's Learning Games contest by Rampage Games. I got a chance to see it briefly at CT FIG, but now have my own copy to review and take some pictures of.

Everything has a wonderful "space" feel, and it's always great to see how far The Game Crafter's components have come.

I'll have a review of this one up shortly, so make sure to keep an eye on [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com) to see when it lands.
