Continuing my earlier [Tak](http://pawnsperspective.com/Discovering-Tak/) [posts](http://pawnsperspective.com/Discovering-Tak-Part-2/), I figured I'd look into some Tak bots. Sometimes it's nice to practice against an AI, and i've played with 3 pretty good ones.

The first one I tried, and it's actually a newer AI, is [Takkerus](https://github.com/cdbfoster/takkerus) by cdbfoster. It needs to be compiled in Rust of OSX and Linux, but there's also Windows binary available to play. It's text based, and you need to know [Portable Tak Notation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tak/wiki/portable_tak_notation) to play. I really like it, and it provides an excellent challenge. I have yet to beat the bot on Takkerus' default setting.

Next is [Taktician](https://github.com/nelhage/taktician), a bot written in Go by nelhage. It's another text-based bot that's a bit faster than Takkerus, has been around much longer, and is *way* too good a bot for me to play against with its default settings. I like it, but I like Takkerus better. It may just be because I tried Takkerus first.

The last, and my current overall favorite, is [playtak.com](http://playtak.com). It's a web-based, graphical implementation of Tak that allows you to play against several bots of varying skill and difficulty. Being graphical, it's a bit easier to visualize without exporting PTN files and using something like [PTN Viewer](https://jsfiddle.net/bwochinski/043hpzwu/embedded/result/). Even though I've logged more games with Takkerus, I can say with certainty that this will be my default for solo play from now on.

I continue to love Tak. I love playing with my kids. I love playing against bots. I love discovering the layered complexity of play. I look forward to November when the official sets come out, though I'm still working on creating better and better sets on my own before then. I'm currently testing a [new set](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1546860) of 3D printed pieces by Ingo Dellwig. Instead of printing piece-by-piece, each players' set is done all at once. It's taking about 7 hours, but my first 31 tiles came out great, with the second set currently printing now.

My next step is to create a nicer board on the lid of a wooden box I picked up at the craft store. I'm thinking of stenciling gears and dots on top. Gears for the 5x5 board, and the dots in between for 6x6 play. After that I think I'm going to try some wood and metal filaments for my printer to create better looking/feeling tiles.
