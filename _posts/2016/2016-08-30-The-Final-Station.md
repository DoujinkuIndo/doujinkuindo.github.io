I've been playing a beta build of [The Final Station](http://thefinalstation.com) for some time now, but it's finally been released on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/435530) and the PS4. The game is a post-apocalyptic train game where you're scavenging cities for supplies and survivors, trying to keep your train running, and trying to keep the survivors alive. It's a constant juggling that provides an excellent challenge, all with a moody, pixel style and eerie soundtrack.

I'll have a full review up soon, but I highly recommend paying the $15 to snag this one.
