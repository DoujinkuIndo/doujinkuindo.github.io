I get a lot of press releases, and more often than not I skip a lot of the video game related ones. Every once and a while something catches my eye. This time it's Assault Suit Leynos, a side-scrolling-bullet-hell-mech game from Rising Star Games. Available now for [Steam](http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=35733063&msgid=527186&act=8QBT&c=275324&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F441350%2F) and PS4 at $19.99 for the standard edition, with a digital-only special edition costing $24.99.

What really caught my eye about this one was how much it reminded me of the 1990 Sega Genesis classic, [Target Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Earth_(video_game)), a favorite of mine.

I've got a review key for the game, and will stream/review it soon. It looks pretty great, and I'm hoping it really is a modern take on a classic favorite of mine.
