[Skud Pai Sho](https://skudpaisho.wordpress.com) is a set of rules for playing Pai Sho using the [Wiki Pai Sho](http://paisho.pbworks.com/w/page/24174526/Wiki%20Pai%20Sho) tile set. I've been trying to get a game to the table for some time, having received a beautiful Pai Sho set from [Lyris Laser Studio](http://lyrislaser.com/product/pai-sho-board/), but it's been tough for some reason. Now, the creator of the Skud Pai Sho variation has created a [play-by-email interface](http://skudpaisho.com) for playing the game.

I just finished up a game, and was impressed with how it played. While still a work in progress, it's fully functional.

If you'd like to give the game a shot you can setup a game [here](http://skudpaisho.com). Just make sure you read up on the [rules](https://skudpaisho.wordpress.com/).
