**Historical person you'd like in your group? What Game?**

Gygax. It's gotta be Gygax. He's the daddy of modern RPGs, and I'd love to play Chainmail with him.

Of course I'd want to play in the back at the beginning when everything was fresh and new. I feel like if I were to play now it wouldn't feel as magical. I would have loved to have been there things began. To play when things started to take off. To play those sessions where things didn't work out quite as planned, or when they worked out so well that it was a no-brainer that they'd be part of the released system.

To play Chainmail, and it's eventual variation to D&D, with the man himself would be amazing.
