Mattel recently released a new [Game Developer Barbie](http://shop.mattel.com/product/index.jsp?productId=99225426) after a pretty nasty snafu with a similar theme in a book back in 2014. Thankfully the new Barbie hits the nail on the head, and is a great doll.

Game Designer [Marcus Montgomery](http://twitter.com/marcusingames), of [wearegamedevs.com](http://wearegamedevs.com), wanted to get the doll for his wife. No problem, right? Not quite. Game Developer Barbie only comes in one skin tone (which wasn't the tone he was looking for.) Being a resourceful guy, he fixed the problem and saved the day. Pics from his [twitter account](http://twitter.com/marcusingames) below:

A simple fix that looks great. Unfortunately, he had to buy TWO dolls to get the one his wife wanted.
