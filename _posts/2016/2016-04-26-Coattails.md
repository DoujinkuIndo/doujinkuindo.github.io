description: So many people are making Cards Against Humanity clones...

Thomas Deeny ([@DenaghDesign](https://twitter.com/DenaghDesign)), another [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com) Editor, wins the award for making me laugh so hard I almost fell out of my seat today. Thomas handles our Crowdfunding Highlights, and has started reporting on "Marketplace Confusion/Parody/Coattail Riding" games. Generally these are party games that are following in the footsteps of Cards Against Humanity. Usually these games are terrible.

Anyway, he added a new image to this section of the Crowdfunding Highlights, and I'm in love with it.

I probably laughed way more than I should have, but seriously, there are so many of these games hitting crowdfunding sites that it's almost a joke in itself. This card is just the icing on the cake.
