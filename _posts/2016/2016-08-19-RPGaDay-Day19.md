**Best Way to Learn a New Game?**

Play.

There's no better way than to play. It's even better if you can play with someone who's familiar with the system. Mistakes will surely be made, but you'll get into the game and the important mechanics quickly enough, and soon you'll be off with a familiarity that just can't be gotten from reading the books alone.

I'm not saying you *shouldn't* read the materials. A quick look through is always a good idea, but it can't beat just sitting down and plunging in head first.

Hell. I don't think I'd have ever starting playing RPGs if I didn't just sit down and play. I'd probably have the books on my shelf, sitting there collecting dust until I decided to flip through again and sigh.
