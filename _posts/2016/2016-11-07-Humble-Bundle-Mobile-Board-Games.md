For those unfamiliar with Humble Bundles, they're bundles of items (usually digital) that are sold on a pay-what-you-like basis with money going to charity. The program has grown tremendously over the years with multiple bundles being offered at a time with different themes. One of the more popular bundles, the mobile bundle, focuses on apps for Android and iOS. This time around it's a [Board Game bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/mobile/board-games-mobile-bundle), and it's chock full of awesome games.

Pay at least $1 and you get Carcassonne and Scotland Yard. $3 or more gets you Splendor, Catan, and The aMAZEing Labryinth. $5 or more unlocks the whole bundle, adding Ticket to Ride, San Juan, and Galaxy Trucker. In typical Humble Bundle fashion you can expect more games to be unlocked in the future and automatically added on to your order.

This bundle supports both the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/) and [Child's Play Charity](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/).

You're not going to get a better deal on mobile board games than this and you can feel good knowing the money will go to a great cause.
