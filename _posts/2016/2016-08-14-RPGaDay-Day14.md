**Your dream team of people you used to game with?**

I've mentioned some of these people already in previous posts.

**Dennis D.** - The person who first got me into RPGS

**Scott** - A great RPG player and GM that I spent many summers RP'ing with at camp.

**Gabe** - One of the best GM's I've ever played with from high school.

**Brian and Greg** - Two great people from my college RPG times.

I really wouldn't want the group to be much bigger than that. Also, I have no idea if this group would actually work well together. While they all had their strong points, and contributed to my history of playing RPGs, I have no idea if the group would really mesh well.
