I just got a box from [SunCoreGames](http://suncoregames.ch/en/) containing their 2015 release, Light of Dragons, and their current prototype, Roots of Mali. Both look really top notch, and I should be playing them soon and posting my official review. Until then, here's some pictures of what comes in each box. In all the following, Light of Dragons will be on the left of the pictures, and Roots of Mali will be on the right.

Keep in mind that my copy of Roots of Mali is a preview prototype, so things can change between now and when the game is release.

I'm really impressed with the artwork, and the quality/feel of the dice with these two.
