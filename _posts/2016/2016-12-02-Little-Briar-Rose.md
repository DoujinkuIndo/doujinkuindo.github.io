Little Briar Rose is a game I hadn't heard about today, it's release day. It's a point-and-click adventure game with beautiful stained-glass artwork that absolutely takes my breath away. The game is available for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/little-briar-rose/id1160731868?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mangatar.littlebriarrose), and [PC](http://store.steampowered.com/app/555290), and is $2.99, $2.49, and $7.99 respectively on those platforms.

The story is classic Brothers Grimm’s “Little Briar Rose”, with the player taking control of the fearless prince who must solve puzzles to enter the castle and awaken the sleeping princess. I've delved a bit into the game on my phone already and have been more than delighted with it.

More to come soon!
