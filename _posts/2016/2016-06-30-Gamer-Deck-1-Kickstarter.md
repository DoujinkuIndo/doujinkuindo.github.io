[Gamer Deck 1: Mechanics](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1238697612/gamer-deck-1-mechanics?ref=user_menu) is a card system/poker deck highlighting different game mechanics. It's a standard card deck featuring game mechanics as a theme. The four suits are: Cards, Meeples, Hexes, and Pawns. Each card in a suits has a game mechanic that relates to its suit. Each card also has a die faced on it equal to its value.

The cards can be used in many ways. You can use them as a standard card deck, or a mechanism for game design ideas. You could even come up with your own games using the cards and the information contained on them. They look beautiful, and I was lucky enough to get in on the early-bird special for a $6 deck. Even at full price, $12, it's not too shabby.

Gamer Deck 1: Mechanics is already funded, and has 6 days left in the campaign. It's a simple project, so there aren't any stretch goals. What you see if what you get, and that's OK by me.

The project has a September deliver date, but it's expected to deliver earlier than that.
