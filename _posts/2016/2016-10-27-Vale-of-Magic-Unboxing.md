Previously I've unboxed[^1] and reviewed[^2] AEG's Mystic Vale. Now I've gotten my hands on its first expansion, Vale of Magic.

The expansion contains 54 advancement cards, 18 new vales, and the rulebook.

I tried to get one of each new advancement type and vale in their respective pictures. Other than that it's just the box and rulebook cover. The rulebook contains no actual new rules, just summaries of the new advancement and vales. All you need to do is shuffle the new cards in and play.
