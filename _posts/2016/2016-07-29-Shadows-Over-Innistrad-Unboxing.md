There's a lot of excitement in our house today as we just received our copy of Magic the Gathering Arena of the Planeswalkers: Shadows of Innistrad. It's a new base game, so it can be played without the original boxed set. The Battle for Zendikar expansion is fully compatible.

There's a lot to like in this box. Great miniatures, awesome plastic structures, and wonderful art. The downside? Giant cardboard terrain, just like the original. It seems we're never going to see masses of plastic hexes like we did with Heroscape again. The cardboard terrain is double sided, though, so there's some nice variation there.

We'll most likely be playing this over the weekend, so thoughts will go up shortly after that!
