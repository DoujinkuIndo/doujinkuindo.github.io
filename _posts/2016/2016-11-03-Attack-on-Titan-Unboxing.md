Cryptozoic's Attack on Titan Deckbuilding Game is hitting shelves soon, and the wildly popular anime's license will no doubt move units off the shelves. I haven't had a chance to play it yet but it's one it's one I'm looking forward too. I didn't snap a pic of every card in the box, but these images should give you a fairly good idea of what you're getting into with Cryptozoic's latest Cerberus engine game.

One thing to note is that the hero Hange is only available in the first printing of the game as a promo. This brings the total number of heroes to 8, instead of the 7 listed on the back of the box.
