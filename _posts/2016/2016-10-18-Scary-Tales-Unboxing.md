I've already [reviewed](http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/05/second-look-storyline-fairy-tales/) and [unboxed](http://pawnsperspective.com/Storyline-Unboxing/) [Storyline: Fairy Tales](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ABYSWP4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01ABYSWP4&linkCode=as2&tag=pawnsperspect-20&linkId=8529a8350c86f5f6da37a8274cdfeffb). Now Asmodee has released Storyline: Scarytales just in time for Halloween. It's the same game, just spookier.

Similar to Fairy Tales you're getting 2 tales and over 100 cards. As is expected, you can combine both games to make even crazier stories.

I didn't take as many shots of the game as I did the first one. Just enough to get an idea of how to new artwork, cards, and tokens look.
