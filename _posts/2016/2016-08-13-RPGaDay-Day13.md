**What makes a successful campaign?**

Some of these prompts feel like they're really dialing it in...

What makes a successful campaign? Both the players, and the GM, having fun. That's pretty much the entirety of it. If you're not having fun, then the campaign isn't successful.

That doesn't mean a campaign can't invoke anger, sadness, regret, or any other emotion. A good, fun campaign will play off your emotions. Make you feel love, or hate. Joy, and terrible sadness. Longing, loss.

In the end we play to have fun.
