I received a copy of [Formula μ](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/formula-micro) (Formula Micro) from Michael Groll's Games when I had requested a review copy of [Operation Dandelion](http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/11/second-lookoperation-dandelion/). Originally I wasn't planning on writing a review of the game, but I figured I might as well give it a shot since it was sitting on the shelf.

I'm glad I did.

Formula μ manages to pack an exciting racing game in a small package. The games has rules for a simpler, family version and a more strategic full-fledged version. You can check them out [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.thegamecrafter.com/1471479795/Rulebook%20printer%20friendly.pdf). The game has what you'd expect from a racing game. Customizable cars, shifting gears, speed management, fuel, damage, pitstops, etc... It also features modular race tracks assembled with cards. It teaches quick, plays quick, and has a *very* small footprint.

My kids and I have played both the full and family rules. Both maintain the excitement of the race, though I prefer going whole hog and managing everything. The family version works well, but really is just meant to play with younger ones so they can get the feel of the game. My 6-year-old was a bit overwhelmed going past the family game, but held his own even though he got a bit frustrated.

Now, it's not the most beautiful game out there. It's fairly plain, and the component quality isn't outstanding. The cars are represented by wooden cubes, and the tracks are very minimal, using colors to indicate the speed limit of the spaces. The cards for each player are the most detailed component in the game, but are still more functional than anything else. The game is as visually barebones as needed to get the point across.

It's a bit pricy, but that's to be expected seeing as it's made on demand through The Game Crafter. Even at $24.99 it's worth taking a look. There's a lot of choices during play, and a strategic depth that I wouldn't have guessed at first glance. Formula μ feels like a big-box racing game, just with the visuals and size stripped down to almost nothing.

I'm really glad I took a chance to try this one. Fans of racing games should definitely give this one a go.
