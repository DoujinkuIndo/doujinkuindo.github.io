I received a copy of [Formula μ](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/formula-micro) (Formula Micro) from Michael Groll's Games when I had requested a review copy of [Operation Dandelion](http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/11/second-lookoperation-dandelion/). Originally I wasn't planning on writing a review of the game, but I figured I might as well give it a shot since it was sitting on the shelf.

I'm glad I did.

Formula μ manages to pack an exciting racing game in a small package. The games has rules for a simpler, family version and a more strategic full-fledged version. You can check them out [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.thegamecrafter.com/1471479795/Rulebook%20printer%20friendly.pdf). The game has what you'd expect from a racing game. Customizable cars, shifting gears, speed management, fuel, damage, pitstops, etc... It also features modular race tracks assembled with cards. It teaches quick, plays quick, and has a *very* small footprint.

Now, it's not the most beautiful game out there. It's fairly plain, and the component quality isn't outstanding. It's also a bit pricier considering it's made on demand through The Game Crafter. Still, it's worth taking a look. There's a lot of choices during play, and a strategic depth that I wouldn't have guessed at first glance.

I'm really glad I took a chance to try this one. Fans of racing games should definitely give this one a go.
