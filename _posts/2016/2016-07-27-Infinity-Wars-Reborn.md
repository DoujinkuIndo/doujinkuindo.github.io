Infinity Wars is a free-to-play CCG on Steam. As my readers will know, I'm a sucker for free CCGs, even if I only play each one for a short while. Sometimes you find a great one that sticks. I'll be giving Infinity Wars a spin soon to see if this is one of those titles.

At the end of this year Infinity Wars will be getting a major update, and a name change. Infinity Wars: Reborn will contain over 100 new cards from the new Rebellion Set, the first in a wave of three sets totaling over 750 cards. You can actually play the Beta of [Reborn](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001BE1MCcg31kvC9mDg6BietPJAbTimThISkN-q6sios_b_t2EwOJvUr1Ig2_nxPUs8fU5dsywCfwfJswFPbMkOJn1ljiInazloq7W0jjxCE95-8JLl-_Z20EHO0HfI_1TW5PvKhVxVQfNVEyQ4WTsBT2ewhbYqflrm3LV-CyDRAriRwB_iTmiU5Dd0oE4_TXSWRDwPAW43Ydk=&c=aZHCvDXaOE3_L45izMFISjr92IzsqurVbk5mesioB6sHOGTAjAzGjg==&ch=8GMzshl9x1OpYWQASryU4ZZoVSU0JIhyinGv0_Cd6cJHpocaYu5z0A==) on Steam now. An update this month just added 21 missions to the game's single-player campaign to start ramping up for the full release, as well as a new PvP mode, and some Rebellion preview cards.

I'm currently downloading the game, and will stream some play of it soon. A full review will be up once I get a good feel for it.
