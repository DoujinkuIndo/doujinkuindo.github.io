I just found out about a new mod for [Terraria](http://terraria.org) releasing soon called [Super Terraria World](http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?social-forums/super-terraria-world.436/). STW is a standalone MMORPG style Client and Server for Terraria that adds an RPG feel to the game by adding quests, leveling, and a ton of new weapons, armor, NPCS, and more.

STW is currently in a single player open Alpha, so you can mess around with it if you're brave. Installation instructions can be found [here](http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/download-and-installation-instructions.13418/)/

If STW is something you're interested in, you can keep track of the latest announcements [here](http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/announcements.13938/).
