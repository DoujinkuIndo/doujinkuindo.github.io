**Most unusual circumstance or location in which you've game?**

I've already mentioned this back on [Day 10](http://pawnsperspective.com/RPGaDay-Day10/). There were times during summer camp where we'd play AD&D 2nd while in the camp van. It's not super unusual, but it's what I've got.

It really wasn't too hard. The Planescape setting at the time came in a box, so that's where the dice were rolled. Clipboards were always readily available, so character sheets weren't a problem either.

Really the only thing that was a problem was car sickness.
