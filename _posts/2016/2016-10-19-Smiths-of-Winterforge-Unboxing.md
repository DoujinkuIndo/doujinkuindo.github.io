[Smiths of Winterforge](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allofthed/smiths-of-winterforge-a-game-for-2-5-dwarven-black) is currently up for funding on Kickstarter. I'll actually have a review of the game going up soon on [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com), most likely this Friday.

The first thing I have to say, and what you're about to see, is that this is one of the best prototypes I've ever received. While it's not the final product, it looks *really* close. As for the rest, you'll need to wait for my review.

Until then, you can check out more about the game on its [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allofthed/smiths-of-winterforge-a-game-for-2-5-dwarven-black).
