<h2>Prelude</h2>

<img src="/images/featured/santorini2.png" alt="Santorini" class="float-right"/>Santorini hit Kickstarter like a storm, raising over CA$ 700,000 and blasting through its stretch goals. It's a game focused on strategy but comes packed with beautiful 3D components and amazing artwork that elevate what [used to be](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9963/santorini) a purely abstract game into the thematic masterpiece. A wonderful update to an excellent game.

<h2>Play</h2>

Roxley's subtext for Santorini has been "Learn it in 30 seconds. Play it for life." This holds true for the very basic playing of the game. There are only 3 basic rules to the game:

1. Move - Move one of your two builders to a neighboring space either orthogonally or diagonally. A builder can move up one level, or down any number of levels.
2. Build - After moving you may build in any space next to the moved builder. There's 3 levels to a building plus a domed cap.
3. Win - If you can get either of your builders up to the 3rd level of a building, you win! A builder cannot move on top of a domed building.

That's it!

Of course, there's more to it than that if you want a bit more depth. There's a stack of God cards that can be used to provide tons of variation to how builders are moved, buildings are built, and more. The youngest player chooses as many God cards as there are players, and then the players choose which God cards they want. The power granted from that card is used throughout the game.

Want a bit more than that? There's also the Golden Fleece expansion which adds more God cards, Hero cards with powers that can only be used once per game, and a Golden Fleece token that changes the way God cards are used.

When using the Golden Fleece, the token is placed on the board by the first player to place a builder. A single God card is chosen, then the player who placed their workers second takes the first turn. Whenever a builder is placed next to the Golden Fleece token that player can use the God power listed on the chosen card.

Santorini works best with two players, but there are rules for playing with 3-4.

<h2>Pieces</h2>

Everything in Santorini's box screams quality. The first thing you'll be presented with upon opening the game is a softcover children's story explaining how the game of Santorini came to be. The book is beautifully illustrated and excellently crafted.

After the rulebook and the bottom of the board. Underneath that are the bags of building pieces, the builders, and the rest of the board.

The board is amazing, with the play space elevated a few inches off the table. The builder miniatures are finely sculpted and cast in a sturdy plastic. The building pieces are lightweight, yet strong, and fit together in a way that's incredibly satisfying. The cardstock is thick, yet the cards are easily shuffled. As for the artwork and design, it's all top notch through and through.

Santorini has some of the best components I've been in a while.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

Santorini hit all the right buttons with me and my family. With colorful, cute artwork, amazing components, and easy-to-learn gameplay I can see this one hitting the table a lot in the near future. Already we've played the game more than a few times and the kids keep asking for more. Between the sheer quantity of God cards, and the added bonus of Hero cards and alternate gameplay added with the Golden Fleece expansion, I can't imagine us getting board with it anytime soon.

This is one I'd say is a must-have for any gamer's board game collection. It's a serious strategy game that's family friendly, easily accessible, and looks absolutely amazing.
