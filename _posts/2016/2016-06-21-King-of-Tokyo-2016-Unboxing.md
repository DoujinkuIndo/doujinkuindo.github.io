To celebrate the 5th anniversary of the game, there's a new version of [King of Tokyo](http://www.iellogames.com/KingOfTokyo.html) out with brand new artwork. The game is exactly the same as before, but got a facelift to match the upcoming mobile version of the game.

The new version also sees two new monsters, Space Penguin (not really new to the game, but hard to find) and Cyber Kitty.

KOT is a hot game in our household, and the new edition was met with much excitement by me and the kids.
