I finally got my hands on a physical prototype of Flavor Factions' [Originz](http://www.originzthegame.com/), and I couldn't be more excited. Having played the game a fews times at both CT FIG and over [Tabletop Simulator](http://pawnsperspective.com/Originz-Tabletop-Simulator/), it's great to have a copy of my own to try out with my kids.

Of course I had to take some pictures before sitting down and breaking in my copy, so here they are for your enjoyment.

This is another game that I'll be posting a full preview of on [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com) once its Kickstarter launches.
