Yodo1 is releasing [Looty Dungeon](http://lootydungeon.com/) to Android on September 27th. The game tosses 40 different classes, each with their own abilities, into increasingly difficult dungeons filled with monsters and traps. In a similar fashion to their wildly popular Crossy Road, Looty Dungeon features a "one-tap" control scheme. Of course it will also use a similar free-to-play model with paid unlockables.

Looty Dungeon is already available on the [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/looty-dungeon/id1055455919), so if you've got an iOS device you're ready to dig in and play.
