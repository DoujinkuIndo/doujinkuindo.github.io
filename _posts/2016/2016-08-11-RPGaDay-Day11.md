**Which gamer most effected the way you play?**

I can't really say one player has effected the way I play more than others, as my experience as a role-player only grows with each different person I play with. Was is Dennis D., the first person to introduce me to RPGs back when I was 8-years-old? Was it Scott, who first introduced me to different campaign settings? How about Gabe, the most excellent GM I played with in high school? Greg, who both ran and played so many different campaigns in college? What about Wil Wheaton? I've read and watched his thoughts/experiences with RPGs.

There's so many people who've opened my eyes to may different ways and styles of play. I can't just choose one and say they've had the greatest impact on me.
