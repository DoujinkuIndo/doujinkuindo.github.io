The [Connecticut Festival of Indie Games Mid-Year Event](http://www.ct-fig.com/festival-info.html) is now over, and it was a great time. As usual, the folks over at [Geek Fever Games](http://www.geekfevergames.com) put on a hell of a show. [The Tabletop Shop](https://www.facebook.com/TabletopShopCT/info?tab=overview) was an excellent venue with tons of space for everyone and I'm glad I finally had a chance to take the ride over there. Huge thanks to Matt for letting everyone use the space.

The festival was filled to the brim pretty much the entire time I was there. I rarely saw an empty table. There were plenty of familiar faces about, and a lot of new ones, too! I had a chance to try a bunch of games I have played before, including [Super Weapon](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/super-weapon), [No Regerts](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samromage/no-regerts-the-game-of-art-and-poor-life-choices), [Looting Atlantis](https://sites.google.com/site/shootagaingames2/home/looting-atlantis), Sausage Factory, and more.

Full coverage of my time at CT FIG will be going up on [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com) tonight. I really wanted to start yesterday, but a bit of a cold running through my family finally hit me. Rest assured I'll have a full report of all the awesome stuff I saw completed by the end of the week!
