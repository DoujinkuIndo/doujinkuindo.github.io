[Four](http://www.marchforthgames.com/idevaffiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1) is a new, team-based card game by March Forth Games. It's a chaotic game where teams of players ages 8+ can enjoy an easy-to-learn rule set and a quick 20 minute play time.

March Forth sent me a copy to review so I figured I'd do a quick unboxing before I did so. There's not much in the box except cards and tokens. Thanks to a small deck size I was able to take a picture of every card type in the deck.

*A copy of Four was provided by March Forth Games for unboxing and review. This is a commission paid product posting based on the game's sale through A Pawn's Perspective referral.*
