AEG is on a hot streak with games recently and Yeti doesn't look to be an exception. Aimed at families, it has a 3D board that you build before you play and comes in at 20-40 minutes of game time.

While I normally just take pictures of the components straight out of the box, I couldn't help but put the board together to snap some pics of.

Everything here looks top notch, and I can't wait to get the game to the table with the kids.
