While I've never played any of the Anima tabletop games, I've always admired the art style of them. To be more specific, the crazy weapons. A while back ago BadLand Games kickstarted a video game adaptation of Anima called Anima: Gate of Memories. It's an action RPG that has a very similar feel to games like Devil May Cry where you're creating huge combos to take down hordes of baddies. I haven't tried it, but it looks like I may be soon.

As of June the game has been available on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/380750/) for the PC, Xbox One, and PS4. Come October 28th Mac users will be able to snag and play the game from Steam as well. The reviews are mixed, so I'm holding off judgment until I actually get my hands on the game.
