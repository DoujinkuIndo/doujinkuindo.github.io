Yesterday some Beyblade fans were lucky enough to grab Hasbro's upcoming Beyblade Burst app as it popped up on the iTunes store, then was quickly taken down.

Reddit user [n0xWave](http://reddit.com/user/n0xWave) was able to grab some screens for me, since he was able to get the app before it disappeared. In the shots you can get a good look at the interface, and some of the app's functionality. We also get a glimpse of what Hasbro is renaming some of the Beys.

You can see it's similar to past Beyblade apps released by Hasbro, but with some extra functionality like a scanner, most likely for scanning codes that come with physical Beys. In the past they used codes you had to enter by hand.

Overall it's looking pretty slick, and it's nice to know we'll get seeing Burst in the states soon.
