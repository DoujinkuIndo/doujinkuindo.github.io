title: 2016 08 08 The Silver Case Demo
---

I recently posted about the upcoming visual novel, [The Silver Case](http://pawnsperspective.com/the-silver-case-hd-remaster/). Today Grasshopper Manufacture Inc. has released a playable demo of the game on Steam and PLAYISM. The demo contains the first chapter of the game, "Decoyman." The full game will be released in Fall 2016.

For those interested in getting their hands on the demo, it can be found on the following sites:

**Steam:** [http://store.steampowered.com/app/476650](http://store.steampowered.com/app/476650)\\
**PLAYISM:** [http://playism.jp/game/454/the-silver-case](http://playism.jp/game/454/the-silver-case)

There still hasn't been any word of what the full game will cost when it comes out.
