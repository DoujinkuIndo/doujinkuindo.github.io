Hot on the heels of [last night's post](http://pawnsperspective.com/Looney-Labs-Holiday-Gift-Sandships/) is my micro-unboxing of Looney Lab's Sandships!

It's micro because there's not much to it before adding [Looney Pyramids](http://store.looneylabs.com/Looney-Pyramids-Rainbow?sc=2&category=1676) and dice.

Like I said last night, I already have 4 sets of Pyramids from my Zendo set. I just printed a 5th set today that didn't come out that great but will hold me over until I buy a full set of 5 (listed above). I also found a stash of blank dice I can sticker up. I'm all set to give this one a whirl!

Until then, here's Sandships in its unboxed glory.
