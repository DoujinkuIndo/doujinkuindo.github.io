Having just written a review for [Storyline: Fairy Tales](http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/05/second-look-storyline-fairy-tales/), I figured I'd take the time do take some unboxing photos. The game doesn't contain much except cards and tokens, but the production value is excellent.

One of the coolest things about Storyline is how the Narrator Cards and Story Cards combine to look like pages in a book. Combine this with excellent fairy tale artwork, and a party game mechanic made into a kids game, and Storyline is an excellent way to spend time with the family.
