[Oh My Gods](http://www.gameworthylabs.com/games/oh-my-gods) is a game I first played at [CT FIG](http://ct-fig.com). I've got a review of the game coming shortly, but I figured I'd take some pictures and get them posted before then.

As you can see, there's not much in the box. Don't judge the game by that fact, though, as there's a lot of fun to be had here!

One of my favorite little bonuses is the inclusion of both a book of tear-off check sheets and several cards that work with dry erase markers.
