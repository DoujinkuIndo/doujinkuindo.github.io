**Most amazing thing a game group did for their community?**

This is going to be a short one today, mostly because none of any game group I've been part of has done anything for the community as a group. We've all done our own things, whether it be donating time, money, or items in need, but never anything as a group.

It's a great idea, especially for long established groups or public groups that allow anyone to attend and play. What better way to both spread the joy of gaming and help those in need.

I've been playing a bit of email tag now for almost a year with an organizer of the local [ABC program](http://www.simsburyabetterchance.org) where I live, trying to setup a game day. I'm now going to give her an email again to see if we can connect.
