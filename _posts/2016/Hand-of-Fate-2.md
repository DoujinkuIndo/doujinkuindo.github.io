title: 2016 08 16 Hand Of Fate 2
---

I enjoyed the original [Hate of Fate](http://www.purplepawn.com/2014/08/second-lookhand-of-fate/), though I got burnt out on it fairly quickly. It felt like a great start, but it needed a bit more. Hand of Fate 2 looks like it may deliver that, though I'll have to see once it's actually released.

Today Defiant Development announced a new companion to help players. Colbjorn is a brutal melee warrior who also provides an extra die to roll during mini-games.

While he's been announced, his full debut will be at PAX West 2016.

Hand of Fate 2 will be released in Q1 of 2017.
