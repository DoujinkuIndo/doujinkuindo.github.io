I first played [Wrath of Dragons](http://www.catalystgamelabs.com/casual-games/wrath-of-dragons/) at PAX East this year. The giant fire-breathing dragon kind of caught my eye while at the [Catalyst Game Labs](http://www.catalystgamelabs.com) booth, and I just had to request a demo.

The game is a Resource Destruction game where you're trying to destroy the most stuff by the end of 6 centuries. It's a fairly standard Euro, but comes together well for a really satisfying game. There's a ton of crunchy bits inside the box, along with some great artwork.

Two words: Dragon Meeples.
