After [yesterday's post](/Drowning) I decided to sit down and take inventory of everything that's come in recently. In line with my estimates, I've got 50 games on the dot that need to get played and reviewed. Again, this doesn't include games already played, digital titles, toys, or gaming accessories. There's a long road ahead, but I've already started planning **r_day**, and am hoping to lock down a date and location soon.

As for the latest additions to the list?

There's more on the way, too, plus a few requests I've put out for Kickstarter prototypes of games I'm especially interested in.

I'm hoping to knock off some of the lighter card games this weekend, getting a game group going at work, and possibly setup a few "play dates" in the next few weeks. I'm thinking **r_day** may have to wait until later in June or early July.

It's a long road, but that doesn't mean it won't be a good time!
