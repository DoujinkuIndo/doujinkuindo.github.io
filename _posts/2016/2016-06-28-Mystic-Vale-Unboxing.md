Back during Toy Fair 2015 I saw an early set of notes for Mystic Vale at the AEG booth. To be more specific, it was rough information about the Card Crafting System, as the game was still early in development and didn't even have a name or specific theme. Ever since that day I've been waiting for AEG to announce what the game would be. Then came the news about Mystic Vale. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.

Thankfully AEG sent me a copy to review. I haven't had a chance to play yet, but I snagged some pictures of what's in the box. It's not my best work, but it will give you an idea of what's inside the box, and how the cards fit together.

So you can see, there's a lot of cards. There's also a bit more room in the box for future cards. Let's hope the game is popular enough to see those slots filled!
