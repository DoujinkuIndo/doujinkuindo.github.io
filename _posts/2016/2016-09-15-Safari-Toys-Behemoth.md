Safari Toys has announced [eight new toys](https://www.safariltd.com/new-dragon-animal-dinosaur-toys/?mc_cid=086c062ed3&mc_eid=1308119b49) that are now available for purchase. One of those stood out to me immediately.

[The Behemoth](https://www.safariltd.com/behemoth?mc_cid=086c062ed3&mc_eid=1308119b49).

> This terrifying figure takes some of the classic Behemoth qualities like powerful legs and a thick tail and combines them with modern renditions like sharp teeth and spikes. The effect is striking.

It's monstrous looking, with an amazing level of detail for a $14.99 toy. It's 5", which isn't huge, but I wouldn't expect it to be at that price point.

I'm expecting a both a Behemoth and a [Crystal Cavern Dragon](https://www.safariltd.com/crystal-cavern-dragon) in for review soon, so I'll be able to post [#HowiSafari](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HowiSafari&src=typd).
