Safari Toys has announced [eight new toys](https://www.safariltd.com/new-dragon-animal-dinosaur-toys/?mc_cid=086c062ed3&mc_eid=1308119b49) that are now available for purchase. One of those stood out to me immediately.

[The Behemoth](https://www.safariltd.com/behemoth?mc_cid=086c062ed3&mc_eid=1308119b49).

> This terrifying figure takes some of the classic Behemoth qualities like powerful legs and a thick tail and combines them with modern renditions like sharp teeth and spikes. The effect is striking. 

It's monstrous looking, with an amazing level of detail for a $14.99 toy. It's 5", which isn't huge, but I wouldn't expect it to be at that price point.

I'm trying to get my hands on one for review, so stay tuned.
