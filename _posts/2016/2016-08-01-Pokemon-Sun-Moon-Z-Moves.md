**Oricorio**

Oricorio changes its form by sipping the nectar of certain flowers. Since it has four different forms—the same as the number of islands in Alola—it would seem that different Oricorio live on each of the islands.

*Baile Style*\\
Type: Fire/Flying

The Baile Style Oricorio is very passionate, and power fills its body when it dances. It sends downy fluff flying during its intense dances.

*Pom-Pom Style*\\
Type: Electric/Flying

The Pom-Pom Style Oricorio is very friendly toward people, and it uses dancing to encourage Trainers who are feeling glum. When it dances, its feathers are charged with static electricity.

*Pa'u Style*\\
Type: Psychic/Flying

The Pa'u Style Oricorio acts at its own pace, which sometimes makes it difficult to deal with. It sharpens its spirited moves through dance, which increases its psychic power.

*Sensu Style*\\
Type: Ghost/Flying

The Sensu Style Oricorio is quiet and collected. By means of its dance, it gathers the spirits drifting about in an area and borrows their power to fight.

**Minior**\\
Type: Rock/Flying

Minior are formed in the stratosphere and live by absorbing the detritus around them. When they’ve consumed a large quantity of particles, their bodies become heavy, and they fall toward the planet’s surface. Minior has a hard and heavy outer shell with a core within.

**Gumshoos**\\
Type: Normal

Gumshoos is the Evolution of Yungoos. It will call on Yungoos allies and stand in the way of trial-goers.

**Fomantis**\\
Type: Grass

Fomantis is nocturnal, and it performs photosynthesis while it sleeps during the day by spreading out its leaves in all directions. Because of the danger of staying in the same location two days in a row, Fomantis begins its search for the next day’s spot as soon as the sun sets.

**Lurantis**\\
Type: Grass

Lurantis draws opponents near to itself with its flowerlike appearance and aroma—and then it takes them down. It’s said to be the most gorgeous of all Grass-type Pokémon, due to its brilliant coloration and elegant moves.

**Mudbray**\\
Type: Ground

Mudbray could once be found all over the world but is now a protected species. It’s said that the Alola region is the only place in the world where Mudbray can still be found in the wild.

**Pokémon Adapted to the Alola Region**

Some Pokémon have adapted to the distinctive microclimates of the Alola region and have taken on different forms than they have in other regions. These Pokémon are called regional variants. After taking root in the Alola region, they live like native Pokémon. These regional variant Pokémon can have different appearances and types, and their way of living can also differ from that of the forms previously known.

**Alolan Exeggutor**\\
Type: Grass/Dragon

Unlike other Exeggutor, the Alolan Exeggutor has a fourth head—on its tail! This fourth head controls the tail independently and can take on opponents to the rear that can’t be reached by the main heads’ attacks.

**Alolan Vulpix**\\
Type: Ice

It is said that Vulpix came to the Alola region together with humans, but the Fox Pokémon moved to the snowy mountain peaks to avoid the normal habitats of other Pokémon, and thus it ended up taking on this form.

**Alolan Ninetales**\\
Type: Ice/Fairy

Alolan Ninetales is able to produce ice crystals from the fur that covers its body. It can use these ice crystals to block attacks, or it can form balls of ice, which it fires like bullets at opponents. These ice missiles have enough power to pulverize rock.

**Alolan Sandshrew**\\
Type: Ice/Steel

Sandshrew have historically lived in desert areas, but the frequent eruptions of nearby volcanoes drove them to abandon the desert and migrate to snowy mountains where they took on this form.

**Alolan Sandslash**\\
Type: Ice/Steel

The Alolan Sandshrew of the snowy mountains evolve into Alolan Sandslash with spiny backs that are covered in ice. Alolan Sandslash hide themselves in the snow when strong enemies appear, leaving only their needles exposed and ready for business.

**Island Challenge, Z-Moves, and Poké Ride**

Instead of the tried-and-true Gym model that Pokémon has stuck to for years, the Alola region hosts an Island Challenge for their trainers. Each of the 4 main islands of Alola hosts a challenge to trainers, and it's not always just a Pokémon battle. There may be items to find, or puzzles to solve. At the end of each trial, a mighty Pokémon known as a Totem Pokémon will be waiting. A Totem Pokémon is much larger than others of its species, and its body is enveloped in a special aura. When Totem Pokémon battle, they summon ally Pokémon to join them. With the support of these allies, the Totem Pokémon become more powerful.

The final trial on each island is called the grand trial where Pokémon battle against the Kahuna who leads that island. Kahunas are chosen by the Pokémon known as guardian deities, which are also found on each island. If a trial-goer succeeds in clearing this grand trial, they will be publicly recognized as having cleared all of the island’s trials and can move on to the next island.

Z-Moves are a new element that has been introduced into the Pokémon battles in Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon. Z-Moves are powerful moves that can only be used once during battle. The explosive force of a Z-Move is the result of both the Trainer and Pokémon releasing their full power together when their wishes resonate with each other. All Pokémon are capable of using Z-Moves in battle.

To use Z-Moves, two key items are required: a Z-Ring and a Z-Crystal. The Z-Ring fits on a Trainer’s arm, and Z-Crystals are set into it. If a Pokémon holds the same variety of Z-Crystal as its Trainer, the two will be able to resonate with one another.

There will also be a physical Z-Ring toy made by TOMY that will light up, vibrate, and play sounds along with the game.

Last, but not least, is Poké Ride. Pokémon and humans depend on each other for transportation in Alola more than any other region. The practice of Poké Ride is the result, and Pokémon that are not part of your team can be called upon in certain areas that are not accessible by human strength alone.
