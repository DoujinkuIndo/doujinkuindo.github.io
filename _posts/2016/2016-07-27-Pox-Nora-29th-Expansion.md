[Pox Nora](https://www.poxnora.com/index.do) has been around a *long* time. I remember playing the game back in 2006 when it first came out. Now, on July 27th, Desert Owl Games will release the 29th expansion for the game. Planar Disturbances will add 49 new runes, including 32 champions and two limited-edition versions of existing runes.

The expansion will introduce a quest line that unveils a new threat lurking in the mountains of the mighty dragon Valdac. Those who brave this campaign will be rewarded with a limited-edition version of the fan-favorite champion, Commander Nisk.

Along with the release of Planar Disturbances, it was also announced that Pox Nora will be released for the PlayStation 4 and Vita in Q4 of this year.

I guess I need to dig back in and see what I've missed all these years!
