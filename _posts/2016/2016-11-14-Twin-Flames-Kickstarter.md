My first-ever video game Kickstarter pick is Fat Panda Games' [Twin Flames](http://twinflamesgame.com). It's actually not on Kickstarter yet but should be soon.

From the Fat Panda Games Website:

>Twin Flames is a 2D action platformer with roguelike elements to spice it up. You can play as either Joachim or Boaz, a pair of God >siblings who must fight for all eternity in order to bring balance and peace to the universe, whether they want to or not. However, you >have a time limit to do so, that means that you must be quick and fight your way trough hordes of monsters, lethal traps and a lot of >mystical mysteries in order to reach the top of the tower and become the ultimate God of Time.

I love roguelike games, especially 2D platformers. That, combined with the pixel graphics, has me exceptionally excited by Twin Flames. Here's to hoping it lives up to my expectations.

As I said before, the Kickstarter project isn't live yet. Once it is I'll update this post with the link. Until then you can head to the [Twin Flames](http://twinflamesgame.com) site to sign up for email notifications.
