Dr. Mary Flanagan, designer and publisher of Monarch, sent me a prototype of the game while she was Kickstarting it a while back ago. Immediately I was [hooked](http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/03/kickstarter-previewmonarch/). Gameplay is simple, fast, and tight. Back then most of the art for the game hadn't been finished, so there was a lot of placeholder art on the cards, tiles, etc...

2 years ago at Toy Fair Mary was at the [Tiltfactor](http://www.tiltfactor.org) booth and happened to have some of the art on her laptop. To say it was amazing is an understatement. [Kate Adams](http://www.kateadamsillustration.com/) created each piece of art on scratchboard tiles. These tiles were then scanned and colored for the game. The effect is stunning, giving Monarch a one-of-a-kind look and feel. Combine this with overall high production value, and the already high quality play, and Monarch is a treasure for any game collection.

I apologize for the bit of glare in the photos. I was trying a new photo setup with a cooler light and a vinyl mat instead of cotton sheet. I need to diffuse the light a bit to reduce the glare. At least it's working better than my previous setup!
