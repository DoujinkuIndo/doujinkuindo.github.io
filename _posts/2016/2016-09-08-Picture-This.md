My daughter is one of those super-creative types that I always wish I could be. Right now there's nothing more in the world that she wants to do other than sew and create her own fashion designs. Today I stumbled upon [Picture This Clothing](https://picturethisclothing.com/#templates), a new service that allows your child to draw over a template, snap a pic, and have it turned into an actual piece of clothing. Right now they only do dresses, and matching doll dresses, but they're planning to expand. Dresses are $49, with a matching doll dress (compatible with American Girl dolls) available as an add-on for $25.

The only bad part is the waiting. Due to high demand there's now an approximate 25-30 business day turnaround.

I think I'm going to have my daughter give this a whirl.
