  our favorite monster training RPGs. It's my July Kickstarter pick.

It's marketed as a simple, 2-player game of monster battles. The overall design of the game is what really drew my attention, but then watching the [how to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tb9lhvbGOs) video really gained my attention.

ABXY is all about out maneuvering your opponent. You've got 4 actions available to you, 2 of which you'll play during a round. Some actions are changed my the monster you currently have out on the table. The end goal? Defeat the other player's monsters. You can checkout the full rules [here](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/576d4c6715d5db6720905902/576e93a785c5bdef44e51ead/576e93a985c5bdef44e51eec/1466864553498/rules-image.png?format=original).

$15 gets you a copy of the game when the project ends, if it funds. There's still a long way to go, but I'm really hoping this one sees the light of day.
