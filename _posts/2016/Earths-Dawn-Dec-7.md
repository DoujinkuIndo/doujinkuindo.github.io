A press release for Earth's Dawn, a 2D action side-scroller, just hit my desk yesterday and immediately caught my eye. Developed by [oneoreight](http://one-or-eight.co.jp/) and being published in the US by [Rising Star Games](http://www.risingstargames.com/), it hits [Steam](http://reverbinc.us14.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=3bf7cfebe67d59589d33ba07a&id=01b60ef331&e=047d414620) on December 7th. It'll cost $29.99 but will be 20% during its launch period.

The game has a strong anime-look and boasts unrivaled weapon and skill customization along with fast and easy combat mechanics. I just received a review code so I'll be streaming and reviewing the game soon.
