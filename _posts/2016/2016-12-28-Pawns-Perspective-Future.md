It's almost 2017 and soon A Pawn's Perspective will be a year old. The site has come a long way since I first started it as an overflow of items that didn't really fit on [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com). It's grown by leaps and bounds, and I'm starting to feel like maybe using my own personal social accounts aren't doing the content much justice.

Starting today, and slowly rolling out, I'm going to be setting up A Pawn's Perspective as its own brand on the various networks I use to distribute content. There will be new [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pawnsperspective/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/perspectivepawn), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn0oN0SslDDS5Od5usgJ9fw), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/11005917), and Periscope accounts setup and slowly filled with new content. It's not easy to bring all the old content over, so I'll be releasing these as they fill out. The [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pawnsperspective) will stay the same since it's already it's own thing.

I'm also going to be trying a few new things. Creator interviews, in-depth streaming, and possible some video game reviews and unboxings. I'll be setting up a survey in the next few weeks to see what you, the readers, really want to see here. The end goal is to pull in more readers/viewers so I can start doing some really cool stuff.

Will it all pan out? Who knows, but look for some changes soon.
