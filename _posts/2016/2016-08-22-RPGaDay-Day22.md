**Supposedly random game events that keep reoccurring?**

I don't think I've ever experienced this. GM's that I've known, myself included, have certain events that we reuse in games, but it's entirely intentional. It seems most people I've played with have their own ideas and signature bits and pieces that they always seem to include in a game as part of their style.

An example. I really like "approachable" villains. Characters who regularly interact with the plays, usually in non-violent ways. These are the types of villains who are so confident in themselves, that a chat with the heroes is just like sitting down and visiting with an old friend. They heroes and villain are familiar with each other, almost intimately. There's a human connection that I find really enjoyable in stories. Do all the players I've GM'd for dig this? Not always.
