Out There: Î© Edition, the rougelike sci-fi that inspired Out There Chronicles, is currently free on [Amazon Underground](http://miclos.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=0342687b8b29c92bc2a5ab0a3&id=9bbc5836e5&e=c0f8783cab).

In Out There you are an astronaut awaking from cryonics not in the solar system, but... out there... in a far and unknown place of the galaxy. In Out There, you will have to survive, tinkering your ship with what you can gather drifting in the void, and spot garden planets to refill your oxygen supply.

I'm a huge fan of Out There Chronicles, and will be giving this one a shot as soon as I can.

To snag the game you'll first need to install the [Amazon Underground App](http://miclos.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0342687b8b29c92bc2a5ab0a3&id=4f3be2def5&e=c0f8783cab) on your Android device. Once that's done just install [Out There](http://miclos.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0342687b8b29c92bc2a5ab0a3&id=f1287fabb7&e=c0f8783cab) from the Underground app and you're good to go.
