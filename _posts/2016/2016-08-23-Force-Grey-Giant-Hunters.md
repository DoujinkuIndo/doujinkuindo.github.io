I never thought I'd enjoy watching people play RPGs. I couldn't quite get into [Critical Role](http://geekandsundry.com/shows/critical-role/), though I love Matthew Mercer and crew. It's just too long. Too raw. Then came Wil Wheaton's [Titansgrave](http://geekandsundry.com/shows/titansgrave/). It was edited into one hour chunks, had some cool art to go with it, and was a joy to watch. I also really enjoyed the one-off [D&Diesel](http://geekandsundry.com/vin-diesel-nerdist-and-geek-and-sundrys-critical-roll-battle-in-ddiesel/) video that Geek & Sundry and The Nerdist put together with Vin Diesel.

Now I've discovered the Nerdist is putting out [Force Grey: Giant Hunters](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/force-grey-giant-hunters), an edited D&D show with Matthew Mercer as the DM and a bunch of geek celebrities as the players. Episodes are around 30 minutes long, and follow the adventures of Whil Wee-Tawn (Chris Hardwick), Dagny Halvor (Ashley Johnson), Brawlwin Chainminer (Shelby Fero), Joppa (Jonah Ray), Hitch (Utkarsh Ambudkar), and eventually Calliope (Brian Posehn). It's a bit more combat focused than Titansgrave was, but that's not a bad thing. It's also much shorter. 7 30-minute episodes as opposed to 10 1-hour episodes.

The show was put together with the help of Legendary Digital to promote the new Forgotten Realms Storm Kingâ€™s Thunder adventure releasing in the fall.

I've been enjoying the hell out of this one, and am really hoping for more. Matt is a great DM, and the players are hilarious and a blast to watch as they stumble over each other and overcome the obstacles thrown at them.

Checkout Episode 1 below, then watch the rest on [The Nerdist's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl4T6p7km9daNfMrrEpm9mFzuP-TSmDMe).
