First up, Chris from VMWare was talking about Rethinking Security from Scratch: The Case for Shifting Container Security from the Edge to the Core. His takeaways are:

* Technically it is possible to shrink containers down to a very small size.
* Looking at how CVE's are released, we map security fixes to package versions.
* If we remove the package information from our containers, then we need to re-think where we implement our security controls.

Next up, Hussein from Ziglu discussed Building a Crypto Bank in the Cloud. He concluded that:

* Finding the right people is the biggest single factor in determining success.
* Taking risks is unavoidable so take the risks that offer the biggest upside and smallest downside.
* Make informed decisions

Finally, Viktor from WoTT rounded off our evening by introducing us to The DevSecOps Iceberg. He left us with these takeaways:

* What are the three layers that you need to think about securing (at a minimum)?
* How to implement checks for all these three layers.
* Why checking for dependency vulnerabilities in your code isn't enough.
