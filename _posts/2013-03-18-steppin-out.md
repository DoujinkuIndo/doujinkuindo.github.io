# Steppin Out — Joe Jackson

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk70wuIYBBE Without context, I would have guessed Joe Jackson was a member of the Jackson family, possibly an adult member of the Jackson 5 — African-American, mid-70s. With context, I discover that Joe Jackson is David Ian Jackson, born in England, currently living in Berlin; white; _Steppin' Out _was written in 1982, part of the New Wave movement rather than being part of the original canon of 60s pop. Aside from context; listening to this song at 3am driving north through Eastern Central Illinois, far removed from its imagined or actual history or purpose; miles from a nightclub. Darkness in every direction, and then a bright orange floodlight, projecting through the fog for fifty feet in a cone downwards from it, filling the cab with its own light in the rhythm the floodlights pass, and suddenly the highway _is_ disco, and context doesn't quite matter.
