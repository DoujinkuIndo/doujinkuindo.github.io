On the 18th October I recieved the following email from Steve Harper, one of our engineering practice leads (those responsible for ensuring that all of our projects are aligned, and all "singning from the same book of hymns")

    Hi All,

    Please feel free to share this with clients

    A new exploit that is in the news impacts certain versions of libssh.
    The good news is that this vulnerability doesn't impact the following tools:
    openssh (OpenSSH is a completely separate implementation to libssh – they don’t include or rely on each other’s code)
    Dropbear (a stripped down version commonly used on routers and other IoT devices)
    libssh2 (it’s a different product to libssh, not merely a newer version)
    PuTTY (widely used on Windows).

    Advisory : Authentication bypass in server code
    https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2018-10933.txt

    Proof of concept
    https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/10/17/5

    Known Usage
    KDE uses libssh for the sftp file transfers
    GitHub implemented their git ssh server with libssh
    X2Go is a Remote Desktop solution for Linux
    csync a bidirectional file synchronizer
    Remmina the GTK+/Gnome Remote Desktop Client
    XMBC a media player and entertainment hub for digital media
    GNU Gatekeeper a full featured H.323 gatekeeper
    (from https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/10/17/serious-ssh-bug-lets-crooks-log-in-just-by-asking-nicely/)

    Mitigation
    Don't leave port 22 open to the world
    If you must have port 22 open, specify IP addresses, use an VPN to get a static ip (IW have a VPN)
    GitHub project [a] doesn’t actually call the buggy code in the libssh product and [b] has installed the patch anyway.
    cURL uses libssh2 as its first choice if you need SSH support.
    What to do
    If you have any software product that includes or uses libssh, download and install the latest libssh version at once.
    If you use product that has libssh built in, rather than supplied as a shared library or DLL, you will need an updated version of the app itself.
    Regards

If we dive a little deeper into this vulnerability, we can find out some really interesting information.  Firstly, it was discovered by a pen-tester at my old employer before I joined InfinityWorks (/me flicks dirt from shoulder) so we know
