So seriously, what is research?  I feel that this question can be answered so easily, yet, can it?  

If research is so easy, why isn't everyone good at it?  Obviously it isn't that easy and clearly there is more to it than Googling it.  

### Research is a process!

In the most simple form, research begins when there is a problem with an unknown solution.  You take the problem, essentially do research, and find the solution.  Of course, it is never just that easy.  True research goes deeper than that.  It is the process of finding solutions to the problems then writing about them, not just as notes, but for others to be able to read and understand and then to even be able to re-test what you have done.  

###Other's must be able to understand

When you present your research in writing, present it formally and with great clarity.  Otherwise, it may be mistaken or not believed.
