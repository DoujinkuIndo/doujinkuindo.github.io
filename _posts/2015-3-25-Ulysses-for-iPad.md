title: Ulysses for iPad
---

I have been without a Mac for a while now and have had to rely on my iPad—which I have just recently upgraded to a 64GB iPad Air 2—for just about everything. In a lot of aspects, an iPad can replace a laptop for most of my day to day tasks. In regards to reading and writing, my iPad has had my completely cover; well, almost.

If I had to pick only one thing to use my iPad for, I would say writing. There are a number of great applications out there that allow for easy text entry and when it comes to Markdown, forget it. There are more apps than one person could possibly find an individual use for. I've a number of the more largely popular ones, like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) ([App Store](https://appsto.re/us/OSrzx.i)) and the ever popular [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) ([App Store](https://appsto.re/us/bq7UC.i)). I haven't touched iA Writer and what seems like forever and no matter what other writing app comes out for iOS, I always found myself going back to Byword. It was simple and elegant. Perhaps my favorite feature was its ability to publish directly to my website. Granted, the publish feature is an optional in-app purchase, it is worth it. And that says a lot, as I hate in-app purchases.

Byword does have its faults. The app is only so powerful and only allows so much flexibility in terms of Markdown and the file management is that of nightmares. However, I have always had a universal app that syncs between my iPhone and iPad, and also syncs with the Mac app. That was fine and dandy until I splurged one evening and bought [Ulysses III](http://ulyssesapp.com/mac/) ([App Store](http://geni.us/3KfE)) for Mac. Not only did Ulysses provide a powerful Markdown editor, it introduced me to Markdown XL, a much powerful and versatile take to Markdown. Even more, the file organization was fantastic. No longer was I limited to just one list of sub-folders full of files. I could organize and tag to my heart's content. There was only one problem...it left my iPad feeling neglected.

Then the time came to downsize. In preparation for moving this summer, I started getting rid of things. Now, selling my MacBook Pro wasn't something that I initially planned on doing, but it was getting on the older side, and I needed the cash. So, again, I found myself using Byword. It was nice to have my publish feature back. It truly was. I didn't realize how much I had missed it. However, I found myself missing so many other great features Ulysses has provided me. Then, one day, I was losing myself down the rabbit hole known as Twitter, and stumbled across a tweet from someone mentioning Ulysses for iPad. Of course I immediately went to see if it true. And it was.

Since then, I’ve downloaded Ulysses for iPad, updated to the new Ulysses for Mac and have loved them both. In fact, I’ve written this entire article in Ulysses for iPad—including doing all of the Markdown. Ulysses for iPad has made my work, and life, much simpler. I thank them for that. Now, if only I could get publishing, like in Byword, I’d be set for life.

Glad to know they have been talking about it:
