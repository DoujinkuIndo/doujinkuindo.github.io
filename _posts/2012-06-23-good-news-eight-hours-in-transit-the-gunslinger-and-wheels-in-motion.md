# Good News: Eight Hours in Transit, The Gunslinger, and Wheels In Motion

Eight hours in transit. I got lost, and then I got lost even at getting lost. An hour on the train, an hour on the train blindfolded, an hour on a bus blindfolded, an hour on a train in company, an hour on a train alone, an hour on a railroad train with company, two hours in a car back with company. I got another present, a letter. To be read in hours of more wakefulness. Things are good. Things seem to be going somewhere. I'll let you know when they get there. This is getting more like a journal. Not sure if that's good. It's not making me more eloquent, but it is making me reflect, which is good. I beganÂ _The Gunslinger_ today. Stephen King, man. Holy shit.
