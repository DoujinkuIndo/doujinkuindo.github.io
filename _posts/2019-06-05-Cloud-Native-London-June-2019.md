We packed out the room at Codenode, with 300 attendees at the June 2019 Cloud Native London Meetup!

As always, thanks to our sponsors [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Contino](https://www.contino.io/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/), and [Twistlock](https://www.twistlock.com/) for making this all possible!


First was a recap of KubeCon CloudNativeCon, for anyone who wasn’t able to be there, then we were into the talks for the evening with a discussion on Creating a DevOps culture, then Securing microservices in a serverless world, wrapping up with a talk on Observability for microservices.

Kicking off the evening, Josh Michielsen gave us a recap of the events of KubeCon Europe 2019, in Barcelona. All the talks from KubeCon are available on the [CNCF playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2PpmMAnvpvsnR4c27wJePh3), so check that out!

Following that, Michael Coté from Pivotal shared his experiences with ["Creating a DevOps culture, whatever that means"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12557-cloud-native), explaining that:

* Large, traditional organizations don't need to fear West Coast Robot Dogs, they need to fear themselves and their own, but easily curable ineptitude at software.
* At scale, changing culture requires executive support and much work. Otherwise, you're just putting up new posters in the hallway. 
* Achieving a blameless culture requires management taking the first step: discussing their own failures at the failure festivals.

Next up was Andreas Claesson from mnemonic, discussing [“Securing microservices in a serverless world"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/14001-securing-microservices-in-a-serverless-world), mentioning that:

* More and more companies are moving from on-premises solutions to cloud vendors. IT security needs to be taken into consideration, and this requires updated methods for traditional security measures such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
* Serverless is a new approach to application development where the services are broken down into several smaller pieces called microservices. These microservices need special attention regarding IT security.
* Serverless gives a lot of benefits, especially regarding scalability and cost. It comes with a price in terms of complexity, something that in some cases makes the transition from traditional IT environments difficult and time consuming.

Finally Alex Tasioulis talked about ["Observability for microservices: practical advice"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13924-observability-for-microservices-practical-advice). His takeaways were that:

* Observability is not about collecting logs, metrics, and traces; it comes with engineering culture implications
* Use rich context, tracing info, and structured events
* Achieving observability requires manual effort in the form of developers instrumenting their code
