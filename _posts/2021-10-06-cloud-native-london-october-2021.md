Two great speakers from CloudBolt and AWS joined us at our October Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Netapp](https://www.netapp.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Rick Kilcoyne from CloudBolt with his Top 5 IT Challenges That You Should Be Prepared For (starting at [26:16](https://youtu.be/BAqs3H1d-lg?t=1576)). His takeaways mentioned:

* High complexity, high cognitive loads – visibility is king
* Cloud costs – you can’t manage what you can’t automate
* CI/CD infra reliability – test-the-testers
* Everything-as-a-service – consumable >> configurable
* Integrations – first-class-citizen and org ownership

Then Nicola Pietroluongo from AWS wrapped up our evening with a discussion on AWS App Runner: Production web applications at scale made easy for developers (starting at [53:21](https://youtu.be/BAqs3H1d-lg?t=3201)). He explained that: 

* You don’t need knowledge about server configuration, networking, load balancing, or deployment pipelines.
* App Runner seamlessly scales up resources in response to your traffic.
* With App Runner you can meet your infrastructure and compliance requirements while staying completely focused on your application since it is fully-managed.

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
