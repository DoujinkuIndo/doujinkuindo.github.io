title: Week 3
---

This week has NOT been a great week.  I have failed to work each day this week as is expected.  I did work a bit extra on Day 1 in anticipation of not working Day three, but I still expected at least an hour on Day 5 and Day 6.  I did get past my goal in FCC for the week so I am not completely distraught but it does not bode well for the habbit forming process we want this to generate.

# Completed Items this week

Day 1:  Completed [Find the Longest Word in a String][1] and [Title Case a Sentence][2].  Had a bit of trouble looping through my array in the first challenge which took more time than I would have liked on these two items but overall feel good with the trial and error I had to go through.  I've also found myself looking at different String.prototype options available to complete these tasks which has been the most entertaining part of my programming today.

Day 2: Completed [Return Largest Numbers in Arrays][3] and [Confirm the Ending][4].  Reached the Goal challenge in FCC this week a bit earlier than expected.

Day 3: Planned Day off

Day 4: Minor work to the [Build a Professional Portfolio Webpage][5].

Day 5: Totally Useless

Day 6: Totally Useless

Day 7: Completed [Repeat a string repeat a string][4].

## Continual work/forward plans

- Get to Confirm the Ending challenge.
- Continue Build a Professional Portfolio Webpage development.
- Keep a running log in GitHub for this weekly post.
