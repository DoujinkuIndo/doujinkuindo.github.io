## Completed Items this week

Day 1:  Completed [Find the Longest Word in a String][1] and [Title Case a Sentence][2].  Had a bit of trouble looping through my array in the first challenge which took more time than I would have liked on these two items but overall feel good with the trial and error I had to go through.  I've also found myself looking at different String.prototype options available to complete these tasks which has been the most entertaining part of my programming today.


## Continual work/forward plans

* I'm still working to get more familiar with the GIT process (GitHub in particular).
* Get to Confirm the Ending challenge.
* Continue Build a Professional Portfolio Webpage development.
* Keep a running log in GitHub for this weekly post.
