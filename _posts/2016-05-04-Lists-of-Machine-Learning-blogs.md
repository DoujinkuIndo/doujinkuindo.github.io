I maintain a list of interesting AI/ML blogs, and scientist and researcher profiles so that I can keep in touch with research trends in AIML and keep myself motivated and informative for research.  

* [Prof. Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/stat_bio.html) Famous for Bayesian networks and Causality for AI.  
* [Dustin Tran](http://dustintran.com/): a Ph.D student in Computer Science at Columbia who works in Bayesian statisics. 
* [Yarin Gal](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/index.html): He works in Bayesian Deep Learning and  approximate inference which are closely related to my research. 
* [Diederik P. Kingma](http://dpkingma.com/): He works in variational methods and Bayesian statistics for Deep Learning and have published various papers to NIPS. ICML and ICLR
* [Non-convex Optimization](http://www.offconvex.org/about/), a very elegent blog about Optimization
* [Andrej Karpathy's](http://karpathy.github.io/), a Ph.D student @ Stanford working in Computer Vision, RNN
* [Patrick Mineault's](https://xcorr.net/), Ph.D., a data scientist at Google  
* [ Jeremy's](https://jeremykun.com/), A mathematics Ph.D student @ Illinois, a very elegent blog with proofs about various topics including Machine Learning.
* [Ross B.Girshick's](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/) He works in Visual Object Detection
* [David Darmon's](http://thirdorderscientist.org/), a Ph.D student in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning. He blogs almost every things during his coursework and research in Statistical Learning from Applied Mathematican's viewpoint.
