This was definitely a change from a usual KubeCon CloudNativeCon, but it was so much fun to speak to everyone from my kitchen!

Watch the video to hear about the newly launched [CNCF Tech Radar](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/06/12/introducing-the-cncf-technology-radar/) from the [CNCF End User Community](https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-community/). The next one is coming out this week, so stay tuned!
