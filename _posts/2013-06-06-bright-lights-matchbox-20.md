# Bright Lights — Matchbox 20

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTgZJyicteE I defy you — find me a reason to be ashamed of this taste — an internationally acclaimed, critically derided band. I don't go in for the idea that things that are popular are shit, or that  people always call popular things shit, or that only shit becomes popular. And this is a popular song, and I shouldn't feel the pang of confusion and panic I do — but that's on my end. This is a modern ballad, from the age of 2003, when sunglasses and free climbing were cool. Never mind that the guitarist wears a fedora, or that the men in the band could be fathers; this is a classic rock band in its own time, men who eat entire sandwiches and go back and make more, who enjoy playing country-infused rock'n'roll because it satisfies a primal desire within them, the aesthetic senses that drive them to purchase pre-stressed jeans and Hummers, men who could grow soul patches and not think twice. In this modern era of double- and triple-guessing ourselves, making sure our behavior is true to ourselves and others, the community and the world at large, this shameless, unabashed music is refreshing. It's not twee or indie; it's not politically conscious; it's not even remotely introspective. It's a main character (fictionalized or not) who wants things and is talking about them; asking for them, working for them, dying for them. Where pop says: things are ok, rock says: they're not, but we can fix them.
