# Pattern Recognition: Faint Machinations, The Alma Mater, and The Gauntlet

I'm uncovering, bit by bit, the smallest machinations of a larger plan. I can't tell if it was I who set the plan in motion many months ago, or whether someone else remembered my plan and is putting into action only now, but parts are coming together. It's still faint. I can't tell if it's my imagination, my desperately human instincts of pattern recognition, trying ever so hard to take chaos and make order, to say, yes, of course, that's why this happened, everything makes sense, or if it's truly all random. I'm loathe to even speak it out loud, as though it might somehow curse the plan itself. Still, it's an experience. This morning, Grad Rehearsal. We sang a song - a terrible, terrible song - and got caps and gowns and practiced lining up. A very important waste of time. This won't turn into a journal. I could rage at tradition. Or, rather, Tradition. We sang the Alma Mater, or, rather, the _Alma Mater_, a song which no student in my class at Hunter knew existed until Graduation. Yet the administration insisted it had value as a memento, for returning alumni/ae at the Graduation (still caps!) itself, for older parents, for teachers. But Graduation isn't about them. Is it young and insolent to want an Alma Mater that reflects us? Could we write one ourselves? Make it ours? Graduation feels like a gauntlet. Then, Music. Music feels like a gauntlet in a different way. To continually prove myself to myself. Ms. Farber knows I'm good enough. I'm not sure yet. We improvised for thirty minutes and I left. Then wandering the Upper West Side. Today was one of those days chopped up into bits and fed to wolves. I can see the rough outline, and I can trace what happened, but it seems... lost. Pointless. I didn't _do_ a _thing_. There wasn't any _theme_. Still my distinctly human pattern recognition pulls on all the threads and tries to unravel the day until each individual plot point is apparent. Nothing yet. I'll keep you updated.
