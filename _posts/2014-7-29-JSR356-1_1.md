The Java API for WebSocket ([JSR 356](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356)) is going through the JCP maintenance release process as it enters today the Maintenance Review Ballot. This ballot will end in a week on August 4. 

The proposed changes are relatively limited but are nevertheless important. In the current specification (1.0), the issue is located in the _Session.addMessageHandler(MessageHandler)_ method which is forcing implementations to get the generic type of the message handler instance. And in some cases, that approach can be problematic (e.g. with lambda based message handler).

To solve this, the 1.1 version of the JSR 356 specification introduces 2 new _addMessageHandler()_ methods (and keep the existing method for backward compatibility). For the complete descriptions of the issue and the 2 new methods, see [here](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr356/websocket-1.1-changes.txt).

If everything goes well (i.e. Maintenance Review Ballot passed in time), Tyrus (JSR 356 Reference Implementation) will be updated to reflect those changes and should be integrated in the upcoming GlassFish 4.1 release.
