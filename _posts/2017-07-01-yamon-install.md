## Installing YAMon on DD-WRT

I'd like to briefly go over the installation process of **YAMon** on **DD-WRT**. 

The router I'm using for this is a **TP-Link AC1750**, which is running **DD-WRT v3.0-r30731 std (10/06/16)**. 

Things you will need:
- **Router running DD-WRT**
2. **USB Flash Drive**
3. [Installer Script for YAMon v3.3.0](http://usage-monitoring.com/current/YAMon3/install%20(3.3.0%29.zip)
4. [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
5. [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

### Installation Process:
