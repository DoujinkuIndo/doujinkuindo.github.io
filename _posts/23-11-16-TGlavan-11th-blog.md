Salutations,

Without any further delay  I will jump right inot this weeks blog discussion, which will follow the a similar style to last weeks blog where we looked at the Questions and respective arguments posed in an article.  For this week's arcticle I have chosen Rhiannon Bury's " Setting David Fisher Straight: Homophobia and Heterosexism in Six Feet Under Online Fan Culture."  For those interested in reading the full text before continuing you can find it here:

Summary:

  So before we get to breaking down the argument that Bury makes in this piece we should have some idea of what she is speaking about (Looking at you people who didnt read the full thing and for those that did take the time to read the full article this should cement and clarify what you just read).  In the article Bury examine the textual poaching of the TV drama Six feet Under within its online fan culture.

Reseach Question:

Argument:

* Claim -

That about wraps it up for this weeks blog.  See you next week for and update on the Final Project.
