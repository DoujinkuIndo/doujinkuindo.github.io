No time for a real update. Montreal was a little disappointing (expected more from it, was just another city, really&#8230; lots of street festivals going on though), and Toronto was amazingly awesome.

First night in Toronto I saw Rise Against (who were amazing!) and Rancid, the next I saw Cursive, and the day after that I toured Niagara Falls and then later saw Eagles Of Death Metal (first tiem they disappointed me live&#8230; sound was pretty bad).

Tonight I&#8217;m in Milwaukee after a 17 hour coach journey, about to see Blink182 on their reunion tour with Fall Out Boy and Panic At The Disco.

On to Grand Rapids, MI tomorrow for the hardcore &#8217;10 for $10 Tour&#8217;&#8230; overnight there then over to Chicago to drop the car off and get ready for Lollapalooza.

Doing great, will catch you all soon!
