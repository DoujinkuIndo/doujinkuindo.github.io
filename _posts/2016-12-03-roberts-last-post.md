### Humanities, DIGITALLY

Okay so maybe my bolded header may be generalizing things (since the past 18 weeks has taught me that digital humanities is much more than just humanities that are digital). However, and I'm sorry if I offend anyone, but I dread taking humanities classes, but this class is different. In this class, I got the chance to do my own thing, write in my own style (which Iâ€™m sure you guys just love (also, after 18 weeks of writing these, I realized I'm writing to an imaginary audience)). And while I don't mind writing long, drawn out 10 page papers (JK I DO) I was able to put my personality into my posts, and these posts allowed me to reflect on everything I learn, which I think is 10 times better than just learning everything then taking a huge test.

But this class meant a lot more to me than just being a way I can get my humanities credit. In all of my computer science classes (and being a computer science major, I've taken a lot of them) I don't do anything with the stuff I learn. Sure we have weekly projects that utilize all the fancy coding functions, but I really practiced in applying it to the real world. Thanks to this class, I not only learned a lot about digital humanities and the various ways we can study human interaction through the web (studying nodes and networks was probably the most interesting to me) and a whole bunch of other things (don't want to get into the specifics of what we learned because I'm sure we all know what we learned), but I actually learned a lot about applying what I learned for COMPUTER SCIENCE in this class, showing me that there's lots more to my major than data structures and logic. On a side note, learning how to utilize APIs actually helped me win 3rd place at the Wells Fargo Hackathon, thanks Professor!

Sorry if this post seems very biased, but I'm just absolutely EXSTATIC about how useful everything I learned in this class will be for me. I haven't really done any research programs without having them due as a project, but after learning about all the exciting things I can do with data I have a ton of ideas for things I can do on my own (be sure to [check me out](https://github.com/rsjudka) on my github ;) ).

Again, I want to thank you Professor for showing me that learning humanities is not always a drag, and sometimes we can make cool things with a lot of cool resources. I feel like I'll be able to apply a lot of what I learned this semester to a ton of things I'll be doing in the future, and I hope you enjoy grading my final project :D
