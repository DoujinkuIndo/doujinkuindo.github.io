title: Happy New Year!
---

The holiday weeks are always crazy, and this one was pretty normal in that sense.

Started a new repo on GitHub so that I can track my progress through the Rust book, which is a langague that I finally feel like I should learn.

I've been using Python almost exclusively for a year and figure 2019 will be the year of Rust. I remember starting to learn Java in high school way back in the day, and have toyed around with C a bit, but this one should be pretty fun. I love the package manager system and making actual exectuables from source.

Definitely still going to use Python, but for the things I do at work I should be able to figure it out enough. That compiler really is quite awesome.
