I always thought a lot of yelling was the best way to make an argument, turns out it's not. 

A quick review for section three of "The Craft of Research". 

  It is important to keep in mind that when writing a research report, the report is not an argument but a discussion, where the report is a medium to purse a claim. To support a claim, the report needs sub claims or reasons of support. Then, these sub claims need evidence to show that it is true. With evidence the reader will gain trust and they will be able to realize that the writer is not a shady idea dealer who’s trying to score a quick one but an actual researcher whose claims have valid points. The key is to have trust between the researcher and reader. Another way to achieve more trust is to show that the researcher isn't arrogant, but that they understand all sides of the argument, this will also thicken the argument. This is shown by acknowledging counterarguments and confusing parts of the argument. Either explain why that train of thought is incorrect or it is even possible to just acknowledge and not answer. But when an answer is given, it needs support and should be treated as a sub claim. The last way to gain trust and have a clearer argument is to have warrants, these can be achieved explaining the connection between points, the reader might not understand why X is important to Y so the researcher needs to explain that when X then Y.
  
  I decided to try to use these methods to try to make an argument, specifically on a topic that most people disagree including me.
  
   Claim: The 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors are the greatest basketball team of all time.
   
   Sub claim: They were the most dominate regular season team of all time.
   Evidence: They had the best regular season record of all time, beating the 1996 Bull's record.
   Counterargument: They lost in the finals while the Bull’s won the 1996 finals. 
   Answer: The Warriors lost to LeBron James, one of the greatest if not the greatest basketball players of all time. The Cavs also got a    great performance from Kyrie Irving and supporting cast. The 1996 Bulls faced the Supersonics, who did have a hall of famer in Gary        Payton but no once in a generation player like LeBron James.
