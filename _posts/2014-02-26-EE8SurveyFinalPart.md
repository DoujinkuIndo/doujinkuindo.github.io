The results of our recent Java EE 8 Community Survey are in! 

As we promised earlier, the final phase of this outreach is an opportunity for you to let us know your priorities among the most frequently requested of the features from the surveys.

But it's not just about what's important and what's not important, it's also about relative importance and resources! We can't do everything on this list in one release, and there will certainly be things not on this list that we will need to do. But we want your help telling us how you would spend limited resources on the items on this list.

So today, we are launching the final survey (intelligently named 'Part 3'). The idea is very simple, we are granting you a budget of 100 points to tell us which proposed improvement(s) (existing specification improvement, completely new feature or new technology) you think is (are) important. If you think there is one 'must-have' improvement, just give it a lot of points... up to 100 points if it's really that critical for you. The only rule is that you have to allocate all of your points, not 99, not 101, 100 points on one or more proposed improvement(s).

It should be mentioned that not all of these technological improvements are equivalent in terms of difficulty, some might be relatively 'simple' to implement while other will clearly require more thinking and work. Also, while input from our Java EE developer community is of enormous importance to us, these results are not binding. We have to balance all the feedback we received, that's your feedback but also the input of the various Java EE licensees, the members of our Expert Group, etc.

Finally, it is a good occasion to remind that there is another way to contribute and influence Java EE evolution, it is to join one of the existing Expert Group projects.

So please tell us what you think is important for Java EE 8!

In advance and on behalf of the Oracle Java EE Team, **a big thanks**!
