So I was trying to learn elasticsearch for work. So I was looking for some tutorials and I came across [this official tutorial] (https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch?baymax=default&storm=cta1&elektra=home)

I was going to setup elasticsearch and kibana for it and I thought it's better to do this in Docker.

version: "2"

services:

  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:2.4
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
    volumes:
      - ./esdata/:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data/

  kibana:
    image: seeruk/docker-kibana-sense:4.5
    ports:
      - "5601:5601"
    environment:
      - ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200


docker-compose up
