After spotting a
[link](http://www.43folders.com/2009/10/22/who-you-are) to both the
[Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) and
[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware](http://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning), I've read the original 1980 paper by the Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus (
[A Five-Stage Model of the Mental Activities Involved in Directed Skill Acquisition](http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA084551&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf))which made for interesting reading.

It describes (suprise!) 5 stages one goes through when learning a skill:*Novice


*Advanced beginner


*Competent


*Proficient


*Expert
I've yet to read the book
[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware](http://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning), but the two chapters that are online ("Introduction" and "Journey From Novice to Expert") and the mind map shown all lead me to believe that the book uses the Dreyfus Model as a basis to then provide practical measures to implement in order to make your way from novice to expert.

This is of interest to me because since October 2008 I began working with a product called
[ACT!](http://www.evolutionmarketing.com.au) which is a Contact and Customer Relationship Management product. When I began I was a Novice at using and implementing ACT!. My employer provided great training which got me to the Advanced beginner stage. Constant use and troubleshooting got me to the Competent stage, which was validated by my passing the ACT! Certified Consultants Exam. Now I'm chipping away at the Proficient stage, made just a little more interesting by the fact the the software has just been updated to version 12 (ACT! by Sage 2010).

But enough about me, what have you been working on becoming an expert on?
