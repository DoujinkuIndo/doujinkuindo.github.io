title: Attempting GitHub Pages First Post
---

Giving GitHub's Pages a try with a Jekyll "blog" service.

What to expect from this?

Basically this will be a more public version of my development notebook I use.
Expect there to be typos, incorrect information as I work through events, and
hopefully something useful.
