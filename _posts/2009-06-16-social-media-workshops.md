Today I had the privilege of running 3 workshops at [Brisbane Boys' College](http://www.bbc.qld.edu.au/careers/default.htm) for their Careers and Counselling department on the topic of "**Social Media - the use of electronic social networks to advance your career**".

I found a few things of interest:
- Almost all the students were on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) (a guess, 80%)
- A lot of the students were on
[MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/) (a guess, 60%)
- Only 3 of the students had heard of LinkedIn
- maybe 1/3 of the students knew of [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/), 1 read, but none posted much

This does line up with what I've read elsewhere, that is, that the [largest demographic using twitter](http://www.blogherald.com/2009/01/27/exploring-social-media-defining-twitter-demographics-and-interests/) are [older than the students at BBC](http://leehopkins.net/2009/05/02/links-for-2009-05-01/).

Although it seems that [this doesn't account for other twitter clients](http://www.nickburcher.com/2009/03/twitter-demographics-and-usage.html) such as [tweetdeck](http://tweetdeck.com/beta/), [twhirl](http://www.twhirl.org/), [seesmic desktop](http://desktop.seesmic.com/). (Bonus link: [Australian stats for twitter](http://laurelpapworth.com/australia-twitter-statistics/))

I have to say that I did push the view that they should be creating themselves a [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) profile now!

Before they enter the workforce, they should in my view, fill it in with:

- their educational history,
- encourage their lecturers, any part-time employers and members of any sporting clubs they are a part of to also join up to LinkedIn,
- they should then connect with each other via LinkedIn
- then they need to ask for recommendations.

This gives them the opportunity to write their own history online, to actively create the content that google will find when a potential employer checks up on them.

Thanks to both David Ogilvie and Renate Falkenhagen at [BBC](http://www.bbc.qld.edu.au/careers/default.htm) for inviting me to be a part of the program today and a special mention to [Lee Hopkins](http://leehopkins.net/), because I've learnt a lot about social media and communication from him.

My own LinkedIn profile is here: [www.linkedin.com/in/benhamilton](http://www.linkedin.com/in/benhamilton).

I encourage you to connect with me there, also, you can follow me on twitter at [twitter.com/benhamilton](http://www.twitter.com/benhamilton).
