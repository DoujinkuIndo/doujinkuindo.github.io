Reading the post over [The Technium](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php) about **True Fans**
 and it made me think (and I'm taking a personal approach here):

EVERY business needs fans.

**The key** to my business **is how well we treat our fans**.

Then they either become non-fans, or they become true-fans.

In this context, the words fans and clients are inter-changeable.

Kevin talks about artists, and the concept (reality) that each artist can survive with a limited number of fans, different for each artist, but nominally pegged at 1000 true fans per artist. Obviously you need fewer true fans if your making more dollars from each one, more if you make less from each.

Now artists may be creative types, but business people like to eat something other than chicken soup too. It makes me think about the equations used to determine pricing, levels of service and how many clients are needed. As Kevin puts it "

The processes you develop to feed your True Fans will also nurture Lesser Fans."

I don't think there is one right answer, one size fits all approach. But I do believe that this thinking can be applied to more than just artists.
