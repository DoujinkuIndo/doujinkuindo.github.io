title: Project - Ethereum Website
---

I developed a website on the topic of Ethereum to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS and jQuery for a University module. The website design was based off the <a target="_blank" href="https://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin site</a> (now a different design it seems). It even has a fun game! Try out the <a target="_blank" href="http://jackohara.com/COM554-CW/assignment_1/jquery_demos.html">demo</a>.

HTML, CSS and jQuery was used to develop front end components including a menu, dropdown, tabs, accordion, tooltip, video controls and a game. I used AJAX to retrive price data from a cryptocurrency data API and update the ticker and table in realtime. Much of the information on the site is stored in JSON and loaded in using jQuery. The tacky powerpoint style text animations were added to scrape a few extra marks. And to top it off I made a short game using the HTML5 canvas and jQuery.
