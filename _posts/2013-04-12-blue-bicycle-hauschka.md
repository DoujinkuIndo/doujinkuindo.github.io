# Blue Bicycle — Hauschka

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKAKBrWesU Instrumental music, bold and dramatic and powerful, with sweeps and swells, building and releasing like waves on the ocean, carrying no emotion of their own but amplifying preexisting ones a thousandfold, through a natural lens, the currents of the music, strings and edited piano and tonal clashes, dissonance, is it classical? It's not nearly traditional enough. What am I to think? It's pumping along, climbing and dashing and releasing, like riding a bicycle — there we go, that's the name — and the streets rush by, sometimes different from each other but with the same structure, the same sense of knowing where you're going, riding and driving, passive and active, dramatic not out of danger but out of presence, pressing nervousness, a need to get where one's going, what's taking so long, how am I only at 86th street? I was supposed to be there by now! And time slows and speeds up — the song lasts an eternity on first listen, it's five minutes, that's so looooong! And it slows to a halt, parks, dismounts.
