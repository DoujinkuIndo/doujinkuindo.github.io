Welcome to my blog! Hooray, my personal blog is up and running now. I have been long for having my own blog for sharing my projects. After reading "Blog Like a Hacker " by Tom Preston-Werner, I finally gave myself a try. Technology is cool and have make our life never been so easy. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub that host web site on GitHub based on their repositories. It takes content, renders Markdown and Liquid template and generates static page that ready to be serve by web server. According to Jekyll "readme", 

"it does what you tell it to do no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content."

I am all ready to write my first blog using Jekyll!!
