# Radio Ga Ga — Queen

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t63_HRwdAgk Lady Gaga takes her name from this song. Radiohead take their name from the Talking Heads song of the same name. Between the Buried and Me is named after the lyric from the Counting Crows song _Ghost Train_. The Kooks are named after David Bowie's _Kooks_. The Mountain Goats are named after Screamin' Jay Hawkins' _Yellow Coat_. The Rolling Stones are named after Muddy Waters' _Rolling Stone_. The Beatles are named as a parody of Buddy Holly's band _The Crickets_. Green Day is a euphemism for a day spent smoking weed — a joke I entirely missed. Joy Division is named after a fictional Nazi whorehouse. Led Zeppelin is a tasteless, wonderful Hindenburg joke. Phoenix is named after the Daft Punk song of the same name. Portishead is just the name of a town. R.E.M., The Pixies, Evanescence, and The Grateful Dead were all chosen at random from a dictionary. Skrillex is Sonny John Moore's old AIM username.
