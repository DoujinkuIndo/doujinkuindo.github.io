The Java EE 7 Platform Specification ([JSR 342](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342)) is currently going through a maintenance release process. If you check the proposed changes, you will see that this update is really about clarifying the specification itself; none of the proposed changes will impact the Java EE 7 RI nor the TCK. So clearly, only the specification itself will be slightly impacted.

It seems that a consensus has now been reached amongst the Java EE 7 Experts Group over the proposed changes and if everything goes well, the update will soon be submitted to the JCP to formally initiate the Maintenance Review process.
