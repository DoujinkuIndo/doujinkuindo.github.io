# How To Unwind Hard: An Admissions Essay for the UIUC Allen Hall/Unit One LLC

This was the essay that got me in to the Allen Hall / Unit One LLC freshman year of college at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It got out on paper most of my current preoccupations at the time, and led to the eventual creations of this blog its sister, [jetsametc.wordpress.com]( jetsametc.wordpress.com). 

# Unit One LLC Essay

## _by James Buckland_

_Please describe what you hope to gain from living in the LLC and what you plan to contribute to the LLC:_ __I’m James Buckland, Class of 2016, and I’m a prospective Engineering major. Phew. Those are heavy words. Those are words that literally drip with stress. I’m looking forward to a big workload and a lot of time spent studying. But I’m okay with that. Why? Because I’m more than just an engineering prefrosh. I’m a jazz pianist and a playwright and a composer and a designer and a filmmaker. And I have a million outlets for stress, and they’re all creative. I expect to find myself in your music practice rooms many nights, unwinding at the piano. Because when I unwind, I unwind hard. So, Unit One is a vibrant, creative, diverse community of artists and academics? Excellent. I’m going to need a caring, tight-knit family to fall back on, but I intend to earn that family. I want to have jam sessions, to create and to unravel myself into my work and to be as vibrant and creative as the people around me. What do I hope to gain? A sense of community; a supportive family; an outlet for stress. What do I plan to contribute? As much of myself as I can. As much of my creative spirit and love as I can. I think Unit One seems like the sort of place that welcome students of all sorts. Even engineers. That’s why I want to live in Allen Hall.
