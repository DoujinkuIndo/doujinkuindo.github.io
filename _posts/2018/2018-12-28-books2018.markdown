## Novels and short stories

I notice that I am enjoying fiction less than I am used to. Being in academia for a decade has wired my brain to be able to process facts and information quite efficiently whereas I (still) struggle to keep track of the names of many characters in stories.

Still, 2018 contained some great fiction, both high- and low-brow. As always, a new book of Murakami is a delight. I particularly enjoyed reading one or two of the fairy tales collected by Angela Carter. For those liking humorous books and the Harry Potter series, I could recommend the The Checquy Files series.

## Cooking

If you like cooking, you must absolutely read *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat*[^1e403ae1]! I also became a bit of of Tim Ferriss fanboy, so I went though the *4-Hour Chef* on a lonely Friday evening. The first chapter on metalearning is perhaps the most general applicable. As a side-note, Tim Ferriss interviewed Nosrat, the author of *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat*, on his [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ZOlNC7ec4dJbMsg0xJoR9).
