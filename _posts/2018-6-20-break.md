title: "[June 2018] Interested in me speaking at your conference or meetup?"
---

Are you interested in me speaking at your conference or meetup? Awesome! Generally I'm super happy to travel and speak, especially for keynotes and if you can provide support for travel costs.

Recently I've had to turn down a lot of speaking invitations, so figured I should explain the hiatus. 

At the end of August I will marry my brilliant partner, [Nick](https://twitter.com/harveynick). He also has a blog, [HarveyNick.com](https://harveynick.com) where he writes about machine learning frameworks and iOS development.

If you're looking for a speaker from mid-September onwards, contact me on Twitter [@oicheryl](https://twitter.com/oicheryl).
