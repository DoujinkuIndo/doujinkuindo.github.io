# The Colors Of Adventure — World's End Girlfriend

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUir4UwyVHc This is... endless music, calibrated and tuned and inspected with a fine-toothed-comb, with its timbre set just so to create a larger room than it was recorded in — or was it recorded? It may have arisen naturally, the flutes or pianos or synths, what are they? echoing back and forth forever, and a microphone was merely lowered down into the cavern where this natural phenomenon was taking place. It's classical music, with a focus on progression, but it's soundtrack music, avoiding your gaze, but it's string pop, with an image to think about, but it's electronica, entirely produced on computers by people wearing clothing will all the labels carefully sliced off. So I don't know what it is, and I don't have context, and it emerges through YouTube with this image — is it the artist? The album art? Does someone think it fits? It's free of association, and it's let to stand on its own.
