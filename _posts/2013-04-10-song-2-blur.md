# Song 2 — Blur

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk In praise of simplicity, form, structure: Song 2 is the second song off the album _Blur_, it's 2 minutes and 2 seconds long; it has 2 choruses, 2 verses, 2 bridges; it took minutes to record in the studio; it has a simple, meaningless riff and simple meaningless lyrics; the members of the band went on to do bigger and better things, but the song became incredibly popular — so incredibly popular that it outshines (in America) almost everything else Blur ever did, ignoring that the frontman left to form Gorillaz, ignoring the nearly twenty albums they made — and this was made intentionally to be careless, a purposeful departure from pop music with clever lyrics, this was a parody and an homage to and of American grunge, rock, intended to shock and be unique and different and a departure from any other work the band had done before.
