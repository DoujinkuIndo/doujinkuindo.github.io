# Replicate — Fanfarlo

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZT2M3YM3PA This music is candy. This is music designed to be _new_, with new sounds and unusual instruments: the lyrics aren't dated or even specific, the repetition leads you deeper into the song until it builds and breaks into two dueling string parts; the song is built on dynamics, the addition of unusual instruments; it swells and sweeps and carries you along with it. It's pivotal. In that sense, it's very traditional pop music: music that defines itself as new and different and consuming is pop. _Replicate_ wants to be your anthem, but won't outright tell you what to do. It shirks and shrinks and shambles around being decisive or strong. It's orchestral and indecisive: perfect for thinking, but not as good for doing.
