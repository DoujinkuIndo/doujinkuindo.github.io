This post is a short overview of the information that I've found to get you started learning the ins and outs of Machine Learning and everything around it.
"... if you think you're kind of late to the to the party with machine learning I assure you, you're not" **- [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/about)**.

### Who's this for
You are an engineering graduate or a practicing engineer in the Mechanical, Civil, Chemical, or Electrical disciplines. You have some exposure to programming. You want to see where Machine Learning can be used in your field and how it can help you.

### Resources
At the time of writing this post, these were the best learning resources that I've found, subjectively speaking. There was no objective evaluation. If I liked the feel of it and the presentation of the material, it was good enough for me. Although the one criteria that I kept in mind is to make sure the content would not dwell too much on the programming theory, and more on the application side of things.

My language of choice is Python. If you never heard of it, learn the bare minimum of how it works, and then jump straight into the following resources.

 **[1. Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python Intro][1]**<br>by [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/about).

**[2. Your First Machine Learning Project in Python Step-By-Step][2]** <br>by [PhD. Jason Brownlee at Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com)<br>
This resource was actually recommended by the Two Minutes Paper youtuber in the video below.

Short video overview with a great list of additional resources.

### Mind Bugs
Few questions bug me at this point. Is machine learning just an overdressed expression meaning something simple? Is it merely good old probabilities and statistics that we all love and hate? Will it be something entirely new for an engineering mind, or will it be just an application of the undergrad theory? I guess once I'll learn more, I will come back to this post with an update. At this stage, I think that Machine Learning is just an application of stats & probability.
