title: Bear's Algorithmitic Criticism 
author: bear

Digital humanities is a reltively unknown profession, despite it's relatively to everyday activities. It was invented in the late 1940s by 
Roberto Busa who produced an automic grant into a church using a computer program. Since then, digital humanities has spread all across
the world, including applications such as google and yahoo. One question that might arise, however, is how to do it.

One method is using algorithmitic criticism, or using patterns in words repeated, words emphasized, and structure of sentences. 
A reader can determine a lot from how an author uses and emphasizes certain words. For example, a person who emphasizes the word
"western" may be from the western U.S. Another example could be an author emphasizing "mr.", which implies the formality of the piece
being written is more professional. This algorithmitic criticism can be calculated through the number of documents and documents with
the targeted term.

The equation for such an algorithm is tf-idf = 1+tf*log(N/df), where N is the total number of documents, df is documents with targeted term,
tf is number of times a single word appears in a single document, and idf is inverse of document frequency.
