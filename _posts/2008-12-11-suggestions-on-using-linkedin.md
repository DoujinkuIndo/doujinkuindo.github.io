Enjoyed reading
[this article suggesting ways to use LinkedIn](http://www.raintoday.com/pages/4543_11_linkedin_suggestions_for_sales_professionals.cfm), especially numbers 1, 7 & 8.

Re: #1 - I think it is important to fill in plenty of detail on LinkedIn - if I visit your LinkedIn profile and find that I can't get to know you better then it has failed for you. By telling me (or telling a potential client/employer)Â more about yourself can only be a good thing.

Re: #7 & #8 - I'm going to work on these two over the next couple of weeks...
