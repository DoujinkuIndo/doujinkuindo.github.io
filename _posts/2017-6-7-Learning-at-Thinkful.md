title: Learning at Thinkfuls Web Development Bootcamp!
---


I have decided to level up my skilld and attend Thinkfuls Web Development Bootcamp. I thought it would be a good to start a blog about what I am learning. So I found this article by Barry Clark Something I learned in creating this jekyll blog is I wanted to add an icon and link for my codepen acount. So I look at files genterated from the fork, turns out ther is no svg icon for codepen, so to make this work I went on codepens site and downloaded the logo icon they provided then had to resize and convert to svg and in _includes/svg-icons.html had to create a link with  I believe is liquid syntax. It took awhile but it was agreat win when I pulled it off, granted I could tweek the size a litle.

I am excited about my first week at Thinkful, even though I have had experience with HTML & CSS mostly using Bootstrap & tools like Pinegrow and the Duda platform. I soon realized how important it is to fully understand, semantic html, layout and positioning and acessability. I am very excited to learn more about css as the possibilities are endless in what you can create. I am very curious what you think? Please get in touch.
