title: Learnig at Thinkfuls Web Development Bootcamp!
---


I have decided to level up my skilld and attend Thinkfuls Web Development Bootcamp. I thought it would be a good to start a blog about what I am learning. So I found this articel by Barry Clark 
[Build A Blog with Jekyll & Github Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

I am excited about my first week at Thinkful, even though I have had experience with HTML & CSS mostly using Bootstrap & tools like Pinegrow and the Duda platform. I soon realized how important it is to fully understand, semantic html, layout and positioning and acessability. I am very excited to learn more about css as the possibilities are endless in what you can create. I am very curious what you think? Please get in touch.
