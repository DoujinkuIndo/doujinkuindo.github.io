# A Dissertation on Post Titles: How Best to Encapsulate Feelings in a Short, Vague Text

I can't believe it still surprised me. Things never, ever go as you expect them to. This is different from things never go as you want them to. _Want_ sounds childish. But _expect_ sounds like you have a study understanding of the world around you, and you're still wrong. It's more tragic, it feels better to admit, and it works wonders on the ego. Oh, look, I'm tragic. Things never go as I expect. I've been working up to tonight for a year and I thought it might have had at least a talk, an aside, anything. Nothing happened. Nothing continued to happen. Nothing happened some more. By midway through I realized that because I had expected it, it couldn't happen. There was no mention. I don't think I have much more to say about that. I don't like self-pity, but I'm good at it, and they say to play to your strengths. Or maybe it's easy, and that's why it's not right. People called me a dick today. That wasn't terribly new. But I think I understood why this time. That was interesting too. On the other note, it looks like the plan might not have been so crazy. Maybe I'm paranoid, maybe I'm very observant. There's no way to know until or unless it happens.
