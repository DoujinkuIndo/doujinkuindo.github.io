# Back Stabbers — The O'Jays

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTeLePbB08 This song is a glitch in my own personal history: it got tied to an unrelated event and cannot be untied. I must have been listening to it in the car when I was young, listening to motown on the radio; I must have gotten out of the car, taken the elevator up one floor... definitely the elevator, maybe I had groceries? And I stepped out of the elevator, and — boom, the moment before the elevator door opens, the reflective border of the elevator door, and then the mirror over the table with the plastic flowers on the floor landing, that's the moment. Just before the door opens. From time to time — something like 10% of the time, in the year before I left home — I would find myself humming this song to myself. Just a stuck memory, triggered by a specific place and instance. Never getting _on_ the elevator; never getting off at a different floor, never with stairs or any elevator in any other building. But getting off the elevator in my building on my floor, this song pops up. It got stuck.
