# It's A Fire — Portishead

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZlEVAhhhVw About a year ago, I made a playlist of entirely female vocalists. Somehow, I don't have a lot of music with women on vocals. Something about the timbre, or inherent patriarchal bias, whatever. I actually struggled to find fourteen songs with female vocalists, and by the end, they were almost entirely trip-hop. Trip-hop is a genre of electronica, based on trip (dub, reggae, techno) and hip-hop, often with rap, sampling, guest stars, and other features of hip-hop. It came out of Britain in the 90s and 00s, mostly through bands like Portishead (above) and Massive Attack. Portishead and especially Massive Attack fall into that genre of music I so revere, the sort which defies description. To call it ambient, drum-based, processed, dark would be a start, but it's more... immersive. It paints the whole world in shadow for the duration of the song. Very wonderful stuff.
