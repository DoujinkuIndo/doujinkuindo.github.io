Since 2010, more than 10,000 girls from 78 countries have participated in Technovation. With the help of volunteer mentors, they've produced mobile "startups" that have helped address problems in local and global communities the world over. And while each year more and more girls take up the challenge, we know that there are always more problems to solve â€¦ and that there are girls from every part of the world ready to solve them.
