#### Charter schools are stealing our students and destroying public education.

#### Students are leaving public schools because they have better charter options.

I hope to eventually explore the two clickbait claims above. The primary purpose of this enrollment project is to address them, get in touch if this interests you. [Source code is available on github](https://github.com/evanrushton/enrollmentCA) 

This post outlines my process to explore California enrollment data starting from the raw form on the web. 
  
I will follow a process similar to [EliteDataScience](https://elitedatascience.com/birds-eye-view):
  - [Exploratory Analysis](#explore)
  - [Data Cleaning](#clean)
  - [Feature Engineering](#feature)
  - [Algorithm Selection](#algo)
  - [Model Training](#model)

As I progress though the steps, I will write additional posts to share results and/or go into specifics on troubleshooting technical difficulties. 

# Exploration<a name="explore"></a>
CA Student & School Data Files can be found on [California's DoE website](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/). They are tab delimited .txt files with fields that vary across years. 

## Enrollment
Within student enrollment data lies a story. I hope that visualizing the data will encourage others to tell their sides of that story and bring it to light. 

Data files are saved on a yearly basis with minor field changes across 4 timespans (['81-92](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/fsenr81to92.asp), ['93-97](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/fsenr93.asp), ['98-08](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/fsenr98.asp), ['09-16](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/fsenr.asp)). Mainly, the changes are to racial/ethnic designation codes, so analysis involving ethnicity will require some wrangling.

Here is quick exploration of '92, '97, '08, '16 enrollment data.

### Using Dataframes

```R
df9798 <- read.table("./Data/ent1997-1998.txt", fill=TRUE, na.strings=c("", "NA"), sep ="\t", quote = "", header=TRUE)
df0809 <- read.table("./Data/rol2008-2009.txt", fill=TRUE, na.strings=c("", "NA"), sep ="\t", quote = "", header=TRUE)
df1617 <- read.table("./Data/rol2016-2017.txt", fill=TRUE, na.strings=c("", "NA"), sep ="\t", quote = "", header=TRUE)
```
```

All of the data contains a CDS_CODE that is a unique identifier for County, District, School. This is ideal for linking data across tables. Notice that school enrollment is seperated across ethnicity, gender, and grade. Therefore, for any given school we can get a breakdown of the student population across these factors. For example, Benjamin Franklin High School (where I taught) has the following:

<div style="width: 640px; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
<img src="/images/benFranklinEnrollmentbyGradeEthnicGender8687.png" alt="8687" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"/>
<img src="/images/benFranklinEnrollmentbyGradeEthnicGender9697.png" alt="8687" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"/>
<img src="/images/benFranklinEnrollmentbyGradeEthnicGender0607.png" alt="8687" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"/>
<img src="/images/benFranklinEnrollmentbyGradeEthnicGender1617.png" alt="8687" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;"/>
</div>

# Cleaning<a name="clean"></a>
I first convert them to data tables:

```R
# Returns a datatable from a list of tab delimited files and a list of names
listToDataTable <- function(file.list, names.list, id) {
DT.list <- lapply(file.list, read.table, fill=TRUE, na.strings=c("", "NA"), sep ="\t", quote = "", header=TRUE)
setattr(DT.list, 'names', names.list)
return(rbindlist(DT.list, use.names=TRUE, fill=TRUE, idcol=id))
}
```

I will bind the data tables across years together into one large data.table in order to visualize change over time. Before doing so, I need to make sure that the column headers are the same for each data table and each col contains the same type of data.

## NA Values

While binding tables together, many NA values have been introduced. Much of this can be explained by schools opening and closing. Additionally, the master list of schools for California is only kept up-to-date, meaning that historical data on schools that have since closed or changed CDS_CODE needs to be recreated from what data we can find in the enrollment files.

Luckily, the '92 data file does include county and school name information along with CDS_CODES - so we can recover some NA_VALUES.

# Features<a name="feature"></a>
The first thing to notice is that enrollments seem to be decreasing in many areas even though population has been rising. Normalizing for population growth seems like something worth trying.

In California, a child must be five years old BEFORE September 1 in order to enroll in kindergarten. Elementary school is kindergarten through 5th grade (ages 5-10), middle school is grades 6-8 (ages 11-13), and high school is grades 9-12 (ages 14-18). I will use these figures copied from a [Stanford resource](https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/worklife/children-family/school-age-resources) to define school-aged children and pull that data from Census resources.

To understand locations where enrollment is trending down or trending up we can create a trending score feature.

To identify schools with high diversity entropy and low diversity entropy we can create a diversity entropy score feature.

To identify schools with high class entropy and low class entropy we can create a class entropy score feature.

Who gets pushed out of schools? Opportunity transfers, expulsions, suspension rates ...

# Conclusions<a name="conc"></a>

There are many claims about lowered enrollment in public schools. I taught at Franklin Sr. High School and experienced the following drop in enrollment:

<INSERT IMG Franklin_enrollment_2005-2013>

My experience was local and anecdotal. Some charters opened up, the housing crisis hit, and the Highland Park area is a classic example of gentrification. Our community was RED HOT on redfin due to foreclosures, our city council member increased police presence, there was a huge gang raid in 2009, and changing deomographics of homeowners contributes to enrollment patterns.

The point of my experience is to inform the fluctuations I will explore in public enrollment data. We will need to do a lot data cleaning, merging, and feature engineering to get anywhere close to explaining enrollment fluctuations in any given community.
