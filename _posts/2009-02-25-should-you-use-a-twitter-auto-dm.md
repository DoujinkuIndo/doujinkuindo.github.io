At the moment, there seems to be a backlash [against](http://twitter.com/bhc3/status/1245252014) using [twitter auto DM's](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2009/02/twitter-robots-killed-me-and-why-i-apologize-i-may-not-be-following-you-anymore.html) (Direct Messages) to automatically send a new twitter follower a message.

I have a somewhat different point of view on this.

If you're going to have a message auto sent to a new twitter follower and do one or more of the following, it's SPAM:

- a link,
- say how happy you are,
- ask them to visit your site,
- say your looking forward to working with them.

For the above cases, I don't like them.

However, and this is the "but...", I do use a DM myself. Why?

Because the "followers" I'm after are those interested in my interest - [ACT! CRM Software](http://selectcrm.blogspot.com/).

Thus, my DM is as follows:

>Hi - if I can help you with any questions re ACT! by Sage or CRM let me know, Ben.

That's it. No link. No request to visit my web site. If they think it's SPAMMY then that's fine, they can un-follow, it merely shows that they are not the type I'm looking to connect with.

Those that remain, they do ask questions, either via twitter or email or phone.

To me, my auto DM to those that choose to [follow me on twitter](http://www.twitter.com/benhamilton), is a follower filter.

What do you think? let me know via the comments here or via [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/benhamilton).
