I am absolutely enamored with the recent YouTube trend of unassuming-looking vocalists with devastatingly good voices. Inspired by Susan Boyle's Britain's Got Talent appearance, it's a sort of cognitive dissonance that counteracts our inherent bias of thinking that attractive people are more talented. Thus, there most be a contrapositive: people anything less than gorgeous can't be incredibly talented. Of course, they can.

I don't mean to disparage the looks of anyone in this article. It's simply that they look like the rest of us, instead of like a movie star. That's nothing to be ashamed of, and it speaks more the the unnatural standards and unnerving elements of sexuality in our choice of popular recording artists (Beyonce, Adam Levine, Katy Perry, Robin Thicke). Not to disparage their music, either. God, this is hard.

Above, we have Jordan Lamont Landers covering Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On. Oh my gosh, what an incredible voice. Wait for it to come in at 0:23. Then there's the only1noah cover of LMFAO's Sexy and I Know It.

Or James Dalby's cover of R. Kelly's Ignition (Remix).

Freshmen (Sophomores, in my case) in college who take Economics tend to see the world differently for the next few years. With the advent of photography, music videos, live concerts, MTV, we have come to idolize our musicians as übermensch. (Beyonce, Beyonce, Beyonce, Beyonce). They have to be everything all at once. 

One recalls Abraham Lincoln, who, it is said, was so unattractive as to be unelectable in the modern era, what with televised debates, etc.
