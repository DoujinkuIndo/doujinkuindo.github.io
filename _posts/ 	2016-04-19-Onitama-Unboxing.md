I just wrote up a [review of Onitama](http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/03/kickstarter-previewdragoon/), by Arcane Wonders, for Purple Pawn.  It's an amazing little game with a ton of strategy, depth, and staying power.

It's also beautiful, as you're about to see.

This is one I can see being replayed over and over again in my collection.
