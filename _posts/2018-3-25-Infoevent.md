On March 23, an information event was held at our school for
the intermediate level (7th to 10th grade). There were several
experts for various disciplines invited to hold short lectures
about their job.
Our teacher, who organized the event, suggested that we should present
our project to the students during the breaks between the lectures.

That meant for us: Making posters, designing flyers, preparing the information stand.
The day before the event Henrik and Niklas put together the posters which
Felix had previously designed on the computer:

In addition to that, Niklas made flyer from the last slide of the
presentation which were given to the students then.

Finally the event came: right after our physics exam we wrote on the day,
we arranged the tables and posters in the school hall
together with some of the components and test articles that we already had.
During the event we also met a physics teacher
who offered us to test the parachute of our CanSat with his drone.

In conclusion, the day was quite successful.
