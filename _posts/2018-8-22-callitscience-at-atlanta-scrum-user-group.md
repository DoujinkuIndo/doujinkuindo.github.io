title: call it science at atlanta scrum user group
---

Got a chance to talk through my current thoughts on working better through tests at the
[Atlanta Scrum User Group](https://www.meetup.com/agile-38).([Slide Deck](/slide-decks/Call_It_Science_aug2018_ASUG.pdf))  

I have removed the solution slides, Spoilers!.  Send me a picture or vime of your honest
attempt and I'll fill in the missing slides.
