## 1. Create Free Two-Month Flywheel account

**Important**: Flywheel's normal free trial is 2-weeks. This is barely doable but we should be able to get a two-month trial by using a Google Ad:

1. Search for "[getflywheel](https://www.google.com/search?q=getflywheel)".
2. Click on the Google Ad that says "Flywheel Managed WP Hosting - Get 2 Months of Free Hosting"
3. Complete the sign-up process.

**Important**: Let Tony know if you don't see a Google Ad for a two-month trial.

## 2. Manual Install on XAMPP

[How Tony used to walk uphill both ways](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/)
  - Note: This installation will be for reference only because Local and Flywheel will hide a lot of code and database details from us.

## 3. Modern WP installation with Local

[Install Local](https://localwp.com/)
  - This is a local development environment that will allow us to deploy directly to Flywheel.
