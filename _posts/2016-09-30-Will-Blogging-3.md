(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Not really as changing my picture and background didn't work and I was very confused. However at the end of the lesson, I realised that I had made an error when naming my repository. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by watching and listening to a demonstration and also asking classmates for help. This would have been effective and worked had I not made the error in naming my repository last week. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned before, the thing which limited all my learning was the error in the repository name. This makes me think that I need to listen for every small detail of information as it can be very important.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Always make sure that everything is correct instead of rushing ahead and doing everything wrong. I will improve by listening and taking notes better.</td>
