This is a make up post, I just realized I didn't post the blog last week.

# Some introductions about Once Upon a Time
I haven't watched this show before the class, when the professor says we are going to watch ONCE, I was thinking about the film, the Irish musical romance film written and directed by John Carney, 2007.

So for someone who's like me, haven't watched Once Upon a Time before, here is what it is:

According to Wikipedia,this show
"is an American fairy tale dramatic television series that premiered on October 23, 2011, on ABC. The show takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, whose residents are characters from various fairy tales transported to the "real world" town and robbed of their real memories by a powerful curse."
So basically it is a show about what you read in fairytale stories are really happening in the real world, and they are sort of connected to each other! 

I'll come back later to finish the post!
