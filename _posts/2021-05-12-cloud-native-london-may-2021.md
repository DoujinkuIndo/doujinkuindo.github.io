We heard from two fantastic speakers from Ververica and DoiT International at our May Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with techies joining us via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams.

We are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [UMATR](https://www.umatr.io/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Our first speaker was Konstantin Knauf from Ververica, kicking us off for the evening with a discussion on Simplifying Stateful Serverless Architectures (starting at [27:18](https://youtu.be/I9q49qOEcaI?t=1638)). He talked about how:

* Serverless provides rapid, fine-grained scalability and easy deployment, but even for moderately complex applications consistency and composition of functions are a challenge.
* Stateful Functions adds consistent distributed state management & messaging for functions deployed anywhere e.g. the FaaS provider of your choice.
* Stateful Functions is a young project under the umbrella of Apache Flink, and it's a great time to join the community.

After a quick break we returned with Stepan Stipl from DoiT International, talking about How to automatically detect and deal with deprecated APIs (starting at [1:00:48](https://youtu.be/I9q49qOEcaI?t=3648)). His takeaways are:

* Be aware of deprecated APIs in Kubernetes, as these can cause unpleasant surprises when upgrading clusters.
* Check if you're affected, and make sure to upgrade to new API versions before you or your cloud vendor upgrade your clusters.
* You can use Kubent - an OSS tool that automates the detection of problematic resources.

And of course, our usual group photo from Rambly!
