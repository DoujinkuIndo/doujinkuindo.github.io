title: Let's try again!
---

As some of you may know this is my tenth try to keep a blog up and running. I believe it's important for me so I'm gonna try again.

Because I hate setting up environments for something that I even may not continue, I'm using this as an opportunity to test an 'open blog' approach. If it doesn't exists, that's my time to shine!
I'll keep [pull requests](https://github.com/renanliberato/renanliberato.github.io/pulls) with all the new posts that I'm writing and I hope to receive some comments and 'keep going, cool theme!' incentives to keep me motivated.

See you!
