Hi there,

This is a repository of learned lessons during my software development process.

Software development is a continuous learning process. No matter how many years you've been a programmer, every project carries a huge amount of knowledge to be acquired. Not just because of new technologies, also the requirements can take you to explore new edges of your _mastered_ technologies.

In my beginnings learning new technology was truly challenging because of the lack of information, most of it was on books or magazines or you have to reach friends and colleagues by phone. Nowadays the problem is an oversaturation of information. The challenge is to discern the useless from the useful, not because of lack of quality, but because have to found the most adequate for our particular use case from the vast scenarios available.

This process of find and picking the appropriate information consumes lots of resources, and most of the time this requirement will arise again in the future, but as perhaps it is not a daily task, we'll be facing the problem of doing again the research, wasting again valuable resources. There's nothing worst than the sense of looking for something you've already found before.

Truth is I've been wanting to do this from a long time ago, but one way or another I never take the time to do this. Now I realize how much time I wasted on re-researching previous knowledge. And now when I'm learning new technologies (especially React and Angular) I want to do it as I'm facing new cases.

This repository's goal is to store those learnings, references, guides, and tools I'm collecting during my projects, and be able to found it out in a convenient way when I need it. I also hope this can be useful to you.
