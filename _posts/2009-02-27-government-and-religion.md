It might strike you odd that I'm libertarian - that is, I want government as small and harmless as possible - and that my political view is rooted deeply in my faith. You see, I believe God gave us a gift, a gift so very precious that we have created a government to protect it. The government has often mishandled this gift, and so have we. We don’t really deserve this gift, but we have it.

What is this gift? No, it’s not forgiveness - forgiveness is what God uses to protect this gift that he gave us much earlier than Jesus.

This gift is freedom. Freedom to be stupid, freedom to right, wrong, love, hate, sin, do good. It is so precious but has been shattered so many times by people. God's other gift of forgiveness is the tool that allows us to hold onto our freedom.

In the Declaration of Independence, three inalienable rights are given that government must protect to insure our freedom. It is the right to life, to be alive. It is the right of liberty, so long as it doesn’t interfere with others' right to life. It is the right of the pursuit of happiness, so long as it doesn’t interfere with others’ right to liberty or life.

God Bless You, God Bless America

Until next time

Joe
