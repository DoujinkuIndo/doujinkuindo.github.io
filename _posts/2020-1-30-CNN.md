title: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
---

Let's take a look at an exciting development in neural networks - Convolutional Neural Networks.

We have a lot of good material out there describing the workings of a Neural network. In fact  http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html  tells us how handwritten digits are recognized by a fully connected Neural network. What if we extend it to languages especially ethnic ones like Indic or Middle eastern scripts? How far a fully connected neural network would continue to predict with minimal error? Things take a wild turn if we feed a large image to an FC as each pixel becomes an input to a neuron, the training would especially heave and puff owing to huge volume of hyper parameters. A skewed image or text will also test an FC NNâ€™s capacity to converge and predict accurately.
