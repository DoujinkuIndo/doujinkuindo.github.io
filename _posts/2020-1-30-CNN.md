title: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
---

Let's take a look at an exciting development in neural networks - Convolutional Neural Networks.

We have a lot of good material out there describing the workings of a Neural network. In fact  http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html  tells us how handwritten digits are recognized by a fully connected Neural network. What if we extend it to languages especially ethnic ones like Indic or Middle eastern scripts? How far a fully connected neural network would continue to predict with minimal error? Things take a wild turn if we feed a large image to an FC as each pixel becomes an input to a neuron, the training would especially heave and puff owing to huge volume of hyper parameters. A skewed image or text will also test an FC NN’s capacity to converge and predict accurately. 

### Feature Extraction through Convolution

When resource usage, overhead and performance is of paramount without trading off accuracy, it is important to feed information that is only sufficient for an FC to work its magic. That can be accomplished by extracting the important features from an image and discarding all the other data deemed unimportant for an NN. At the same time, a less common pattern should not throw the neural network off the curve, say for example a cursive writing or a skewed image. Hence, we need a mechanism that will enable both feature extraction and pattern matching. 
 
Yann Lacuna, who’s currently heading Facebook’s AI in early 90s came up with an architecture that became the foundation of Convolutional Neural network and developments in Computer Vision. He allowed a filter matrix (also called kernel) carrying a certain pattern to stride through the image pixel matrix to find out the presence of a certain pattern. The filter acted like a lens recognizing patterns/ features wherever they are on an image - making this specialized architecture shift and distortion invariant. Lecun used handwritten zipcodes from US postal service, to put his network LeNet 1 through to test.
