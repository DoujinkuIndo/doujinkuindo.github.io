Three fantastic speakers from JFrog, StorageOS, and Snyk joined us via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams for our April Cloud Native London virtual meetup.

We are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [UMATR](https://www.umatr.io/), [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/start-free/?utm_source=event-free-tier-cta&utm_medium=meetup&utm_campaign=cloud_native_london_meetup_04_2021#saas) and [StorageOS](http://www.storageos.com) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Our first speaker was Batel Tova from JFrog, kicking us off for the evening with a discussion on CI/CD Pipeline for Kubernetes (starting at [32:26](https://youtu.be/TjiFLnRZLFc?t=1946)). She talked about: 

* How to centralize all your binaries and container images.
* How to automatically detect security and license vulnerabilities in your builds and docker images – along with all dependencies.
* Tips and tricks for simplifying delivery pipelines for Kubernetes applications.

Next up was Alex Chircop from StorageOS, discussing Performance and Benchmarking Cloud Native Storage (starting at [58:54](https://youtu.be/TjiFLnRZLFc?t=3534)). His takeaways are:

* Always test your own application in an environment representative of the final target - this is always the best scenario to achieve comparable results to what is expected in a production environment.
* Understand the underlying storage layers and make sure you test the areas that are relevant to you.
* If numbers are unpredictable or too good to be true, then you may have stumbled into one of the common pitfalls!

Finally, after a short break to hang out with fellow techies, we returned with Matt Jarvis from Snyk who talked about Continuous Security - Building Security into your Pipelines (starting at [1:44:25](https://youtu.be/TjiFLnRZLFc?t=6265)). His takeaways mentioned:

* Responsibility for cloud native security increasingly lies with developers.
* We need to integrate security all the way through our development life cycle.
* Security tools need to focus on developers, and be actionable.

And of course, our usual group photo from Rambly!
