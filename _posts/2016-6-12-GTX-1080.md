title: Nvidia GTX 1080 on Ubuntu 16.04 for Deep Learning
---

I got a Nvidia GTX 1080 last week and want to make it run [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) on Ubuntu 16.04. After some trial-and-error, I findally made it work. The speed is very fast and the price of card is reasonable($699) and the power consumption is low(180Watts maximum).
