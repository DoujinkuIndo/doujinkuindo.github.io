(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As said in the previous blog, I found it helpful to do what I was told as it was told to me as opposed to try to remember what I was told after being told it. A strategy that I found effective was using my common sense more to figure out what I need to do next before having to be told it therefore giving me more time to make corrections or think about what I need to do.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The factor that limited my learning was my lack of Scratch knowledge before hand causing me to struggle to know the cause and effect of doing different things on Scratch. There are a lot less things to work on than in previous lessons as I made a point to improve this week and that seemed to have worked.</td>
