Session 2 was our introduction to JavaScript, the language of the web.
It's a great language that will stick around for quite a while, so definitely pick it up!

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WNizozF99q4Qqx_R04rf1d9a1lIoodTa_FIVSFftHbI/edit?usp=sharing)

This blog post will be updated with full information soon.
