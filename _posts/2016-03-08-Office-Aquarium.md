title: Office Aquarium
---

Recently I started a new job where I'm working in an office again. I've got a great cubicle, and the OK from my boss to put a small aquarium in it.

I've decided to go with a 3 gallon, planted shrimp tank, and have already begun the process of setting it up. I've got an [Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/8ScPd) gallery going with progress shots as the tank progresses.

As of this post, my setup is as follows:

* [Tetra 3 Gallon LED Cube](http://www.amazon.com/Tetra-29095-Cube-Aquarium-3-Gallon/dp/B008CA7W7E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457490874&sr=8-1&keywords=tetra+3+gallon+cube) (filter discarded)
* [AZOO Mignon Filter 60 filter](http://www.amazon.com/AZOO-AZ13097-Mignon-Filter-60/dp/B005VEWCMO) (filter media discarded)
  * [Aquaclear 20-Gallon Biomax Bag](http://www.amazon.com/Aqua-Clear-A1370-Aquaclear-20-Gallon/dp/B0006JLO5K/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)
  * [Aquaclear 20-Gallon Biomax Foam Insert](http://www.amazon.com/Aquaclear-20-Gallon-Foam-Inserts-3-Pack/dp/B0002AQK48/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)
* [Hydor Slim Heater](http://www.amazon.com/Hydor-7-5w-Heater-Bettas-Bowls/dp/B006JVQ67K/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)
* [HDE LCD Digital Fish Tank Aquarium Thermometer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GR0LKN8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00)
* Small [GEOsystem Mopani Driftwood](http://www.amazon.com/GEOsystem-11817-Mopani-Driftwood-Small/dp/B001URR3CA/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1457491033&sr=8-8&keywords=mopani+wood)
* 4 pieces of laval rock
* 2 Java ferns
* 2 Anubias
* 2 [LUFFY Giant Marimo Moss Balls](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LVRRROS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00)

The end goal will be to get some Blue Velvet shrimp in the tank once it's [cycled](http://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.htm).
