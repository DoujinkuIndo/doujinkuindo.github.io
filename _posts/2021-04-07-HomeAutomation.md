# Welcome

Today, We will talk about home automation with home assistant that runs on Raspi. Have you ever heard about it?
Well I have, and I am here to tell you about it. So before we get to home assistant, we should understand what is home automation.

## What is home automation ?

Home automation gives you access to control devices in your home from a mobile device anywhere in the world. for example, your smart thermostat, smart TV, smart light... pretty much everything with smart. Mr Davis used to say "keep your smart phone and not so smart phone off" while we used to write our exam... ah memories. 

## What is home assistant ?

Home assistant is home automation hub. or Home automation software to be more precise. It's free and open source and fully local alternative to things like HomeBridge and SmartThings. It gives you the power of home automation without the cloud so you won't depend on internet connection or remote servers. This result in faster operation and reliability.
