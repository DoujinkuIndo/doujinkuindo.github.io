# Omission — John Frusciante

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug4a8kApRpQ This, a song I've jammed to, only the other day; jammed, suddenly, into a part of my life with less direction. Without drama or pretense, it's true; it's the summertime and I have one thing I'm juggling: a job, instead of the usual seven or eight. And it's relaxing, but now that there's only little things, only little things matter; what I eat is a big deal. What I do in the evenings is a big deal. I've become a driven worker, I think, but at the cost of less hobbies, less social life in the evenings. And this song, with its interweaving voices, is so busy and conflicted, with harmonies clashing rather than weaving; switching tone and timbre and subdivisions, it's not related at all. There's nothing to be drawn here. This is a soundtrack song, something I was just listening to the other day. It doesn't describe or reflect me or my life at the moment — and that's ok. Some music should do that. It's escapism.
