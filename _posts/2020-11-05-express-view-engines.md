## 2. Group Activity: Template hacking
You will be working in groups of 3-4:
1. As a group: decide on a team/company/product name;
2. Find a free, modern static HTML template to form the basis of your website.
3. Each team member will be responsible for creating:
  - one template partial (header, footer, nav, etc);
  - one `page` template representing an HTML file in the site map.
4. Each team should assign the following jobs:
  - Devops: 
    - create a collective Git repo;
    - add teammates as collaborators;
  - Team Lead:
    - Help coordinate tasks and break ties
  - Other jobs assigned as needed. Examples:
    - Copywriting
    - Imagery
    - Heroku setup
