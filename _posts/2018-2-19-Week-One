##Goals

###Settle in to the office

By the end of week one I wanted to start feeling settled into the office; know where things are, feel like I knew at least some people, and just feel comfortable and happy to come into work. I also wanted to get into good habits and build a good foundation going forwards.

I think I did a good job at meeting this goal. In particular I've found that coming into the office early (7:30am) works very well for me. It means that I have a long, productive morning when I'm more awake and enthusatic for the day, and an afternoon that doesn't drag on (since it's only a few hours long!). Overall I feel like I'm much more productive with this schedule. It's also been very easy to feel settled into the office when everyone is so friendly and welcoming :heart:

##Get back into the swing of programming

As soon as I started the coding exercise I found that I was very rusty, since I hadn't written any code in around six months. I therefore wanted to spend some time in week one getting back into the swing of things. In particular I wanted to make sure I was still using good industry practices, rather than coding like I was in a uni lab.

I still have a little ways to go on this one, but I have made good progress. I picked up git again very quickly, and in particular have started using the command line for it (rather than a gui). It turns out learning git command line is much easier when you're already comfortable with git _and_ have already learnt how to do command line rebases :laugh: As for everything else, working through the payslips exercise, then refactoring it has been a good way of forcing me to think through what I could be doing better.
