title: UHF RFID Antennas - V - Tag dipole antennas
---

In the first post of this blog, I pointed out to [this video](https://youtu.be/PWzyPZAPbt0) about a guy discovering the wonders of UHF RFID and proposing to build his own antenna. Unfortunately for me, I discovered he knows little to nothing about antennas, and his demand has been fully about trying to replicate an already made design. That's unfortunate for me, but doesn't mean the video isn't good. On the opposite, it is splendid and extremely educational. I knew all about the stuff he was talking about, and I still found it very entertaining and learned one or two other things in the process. But then I decided I could actually write a post about designing a UHF RFID tag antenna.
