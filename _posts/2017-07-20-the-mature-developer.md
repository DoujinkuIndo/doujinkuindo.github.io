> Something of a suppressed notion in web development, is the possibility that we as individuals might not know answers, even amidst a sense of unknown when approaching a project’s requirements. The expectation we feel to each other in a team to live up to this ideal and the pressure that can put us under is my motivation in writing on this topic.

While we can try to intuit based on experience, and announce right away the the best solution with a reassuring intonation, we later come to understand to what narrow an awareness of the landscape our own experience confines us, and how it can delude us into believing we have all the information; the full extent of the task and what remains obscured from us.

Earlier in my career as a Dev, I always imagined I’d reach some enlightenment where I’d come to ‘just know’ ahead of estimation, exactly how something would be built and all the considerations that might impact the project - *knowing* the right solution, and instinctively describing it with a reassuring intonation. Continually trying to reach this imagined point in a career it seems isn't sustainable; in fact we may find ourselves chasing a mirage. I much prefer instead the idea of developer Maturity.

Throughout our career, as we look to solve more unique problems of for clients, or even [‘wicked problems’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem) internally, we come up pretty quickly to capacity on what we can reasonably expect ourselves to know about in web development, while still maintaining enough awareness of all the caveats and other considerations which impact what we’re doing.

On approaching a project, we seek to understand the problem being solved itself, and bring to bear our most recent understanding of what is available to us to form a solution based on our best estimation. 

With developer Maturity comes a stoic understanding of how seldom this is an easy or accurate process, especially in ‘waterfall’. Capturing the real extent of what’s needed and the best of everyone’s knowledge of the solutions available to arrive at a time estimation is hard. And that’s ok; it should be.

Thinking we can learn all the things is an endless, uphill exercise in burnout and this unicorn-like peak knowledge is a battle we’ll of course never win.

Instead, we should look to focus on core principles in our primary responsibility, and look to gain a little bit of insight from those around us:

We are responsible for our part in a project, and we should allow for what we cannot change, and act on the aspects we can, including setting the right expectation with the stakeholders. 
 
We never have all the information; only ever approaching truth, yet we must execute anyway, and the mature developer recognises uncertainty not as an aberration, but something to shore up against when estimating and to communicate effectively. We’re then able to make peace with the reality of our environment.

Our job is characterised by operating on a daily basis with a patchy map of the problem and technical solutions, and so we’ve learned to trust ourselves despite this, always knowing we may encounter some condition previously obscured from us, and handling for that with estimates and honest communication; it’s our responsibility to say No, and to be honest at all times.

This is a much more sustainable aspiration for web devs, especially those looking to be effective Seniors and Leads. Of course Maturity isn't a title given to who’s been anywhere the longest, but an attitude that any self-motivated software team will benefit from encouraging in all members. 
The best organisations allow their people this space; that implicit trust to seek feedback from colleagues, and admit to not knowing things.

Development is challenging, often fragmented and problematic, but is a unique job in that we face problems *every day* to which we don’t yet know the answer, and often need to learn something new in order to solve. Yet as long as we’re coming up against these technical challenges, were growing as devs. It’s simultaneously painful and rewarding, but we quickly learn that to not burn out, we have to able to become comfortable with that frustration more than most people, and be able to trust ourselves and our team.

The always entertaining [@MPJME](https://twitter.com/@MPJME) did a great video on this condition of bearing perpetual frustration, grit, and problem-solving which is definitely worth your time.

A healthy team are open about what they don’t know, and cultivate trust to seek answers together. To be mature is to become adept at ‘leaning in’ slowly to new problems rather than just expecting ourselves to know all the answers up front; and that is - it has to be - fine for us to operate as healthy developers.
