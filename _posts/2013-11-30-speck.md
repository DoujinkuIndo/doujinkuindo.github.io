# Speck

In 2011, when I misread an email regarding financial aid for University of Illinois and was lead to believe that I had gotten a full ride when, in fact, I hadn’t, and when I realized this, after having told a whole school and parents, but it wasn’t a full scholarship, it was full aid, they’d lend me the money and I’d pay it back, when I realized this, I’d come home from a fight with my ex-girlfriend, furious and in tears, led to believe something that wasn’t true about myself, I’d come home and re-read the admissions letter, I punched my closet door and left a dent in the pressed wood panelling from Ikea, and a speck of wood lodged like a little stain under my fingernail which grew closer and closer to the edge I kept with a pair of nail clippers, a relic from the days when I played and practiced piano every day, every day I’d clip them so every day the little stain would inch closer and closer to the edge, until a full thirty days after the incident it finally vanished as if off the edge of a cliff or a waterfall, and my rage had subsided.
