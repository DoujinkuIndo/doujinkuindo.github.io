As I wrap up my first year at CNCF along with the decade, here's a look back at my year in numbers, my favourite moments and most viewed talks.

In 2019 I

* gave 33 [talks, including 12 keynotes](/archive/2019/)
* ran 11 [Cloud Native London meetups](/archive/meetup/) with 4500 registered attendees
* grew the [CNCF End User Community](https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-community/) from 77 companies to 131
* travelled for 134 days to 45 cities

My personal favourite talk of the year was [2.66 Million](/2019/05/21/266-million-keynote-at-kubecon-cloudnativecon-barcelona/), my keynote at KubeCon CloudNativeCon to 7000 people:

My most viewed talk was [Want to donate a project to the CNCF? Here's how](/2019/11/18/want-to-donate-a-project-to-the-cncf-heres-how-kubecon-cloudnativecon-san-diego/), viewed 8000 times in one month:

This year I've been learning Mandarin Chinese. I presented the [CNCF End User Awards](/2019/06/24/presenting-the-cncf-end-user-awards-kubecon-cloudnativecon-shanghai/) in Shanghai to Didi using  Mandarin ([click here for the English transcript](/2019/06/24/presenting-the-cncf-end-user-awards-kubecon-cloudnativecon-shanghai/)):

The Cloud Native London meetup is still incredibly popular. Over 500 registered for [July](/2019/07/03/cloud-native-london-july-2019-Suade-Labs-SUSE-and-Dynatrace/), making it the largest meetup of the year:

I've particularly enjoyed encouraging women to speak and be publicly visible:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I nudged/pushed <a href="https://twitter.com/k_gamanji?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@k_gamanji</a> to speak at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CloudNativeLon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CloudNativeLon</a>, and she gave her very first public talk just 4 months ago. Now she&#39;s in front of 7700 people at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KubeCon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KubeCon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CloudNativeCon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CloudNativeCon</a> talking about <a href="https://twitter.com/condenasteng?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@condenasteng</a>.<br><br>Congratulations Katie, I&#39;m super proud!<a href="https://t.co/qFeg89E2ZN">https://t.co/qFeg89E2ZN</a> â€¦ <a href="https://t.co/sV8cd9Bodq">https://t.co/sV8cd9Bodq</a></p>&mdash; Cheryl Hung (@oicheryl) <a href="https://twitter.com/oicheryl/status/1131465580874280960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I truly believe that everyone can be part of this smart, enthusiastic and welcoming community, and I can't wait to see what we do in the next decade. See you in 2020!
