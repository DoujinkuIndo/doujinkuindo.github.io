![49 HABIT](/images/dc49.jpg)

It is our habits that shape our present existence, and in turn, design our future. The key to building anything is repetition. Every day we repeat around 40 percent of our behavior, making habit the artist, and ourself the clay. Good habits sculpt the key to all success and bad the unlocked door to failure. We are what we repeatedly do. Change your habits- change your life.
