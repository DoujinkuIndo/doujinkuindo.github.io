title: Machine Learning and Kicking
---

Crazy end to the Chargers/Steelers game last night. I don't think I've ever seen that many field goal attempts in a row with so many flags before.

The NFL this year has been adding in a bunch of statistics regarding how catchable a pass is, chance to make a field goal, etc. They don't break down how they come up with these numbers, however.

Over the course of this week I'll go through building a field goal percentage calculator that we can use to model if a kick is going in or not, using data from last season and this season.

I'm still on travel so it's just the teaser today. We'll go through selecting the right data, parsing it into a format that our algorithm can use, selecting the algorithm, and training/testing it.

Hopefully by the end we'll have something we can use, maybe even packaged up into a GUI-based app so you can fill in the required info at a 4th down play and see if you would have made the same call the coach did. It would be cool to compare a team's 4th down conversion stats as well, so maybe that will go in later.
