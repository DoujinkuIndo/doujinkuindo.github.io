##Getting a Custom Email ID, For Free
###Summary: Use Zoho Mail
Honestly, as soon as I bought neilchaturvedi.com, I had decided I was going to get a custom EMail ID.  
The problem, though, is that doing that required _money_.  
Guess what I didn't have?  
That's right.  
So I checked out some really cool websites that actually let you get custom email ids, for free!  
The amount of branding they had, though......   
Unbelievable.  
Turns out Zoho Mail lets you have 5 email ids, for free!  
So of course, that's what I used, and _damn_, am I happy.
