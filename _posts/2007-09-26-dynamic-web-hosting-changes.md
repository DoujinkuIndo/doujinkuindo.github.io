[Dynamic Web Hosting](http://dynamicwebhosting.com.au/) has been acquired by
[Dolphin Technology Group](http://www.dolphintech.com.au/), with whom I am also involved.

It means a change of name, it will now be
[Dolphin Web Hosting](http://dolphinwebhosting.com.au/). One of those little things that tickles me is that the TLA (Three Letter Acronym) remains the same - DWH.

Importantly it also means a much larger pool of resources for us, engineers, expertise, hardware and infrastructure.


[Lee Hopkins](http://leehopkins.net/2007/09/25/holy-dynamic-dolphins-batman/) has already noted the change, and over the coming months the change will become more evident (for example, we will redo the web site - we might even makeover the Dolphin Technology web site ;-).
