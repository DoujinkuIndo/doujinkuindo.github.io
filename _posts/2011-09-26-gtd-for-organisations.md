Listened to the latest [podcast from the David Allen Company (22nd Sept 2011)](http://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/david-allen-company-podcast/id206576833) on the ride home today. It's a discussion of the benefits of [Holacracy](http://www.holacracy.org/about-holacracy) approach, described as [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd) for an organisation in the podcast, it sounded really interesting, worth a further look.
