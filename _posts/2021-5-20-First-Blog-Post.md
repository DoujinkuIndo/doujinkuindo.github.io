## What do I think being a data scientist is about?**

It is a bit vague to define the field of data science. It should be somewhere in the middle of software engineering and statistics.
Here is a pithy definition float across many blogs:  
"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician."

## What do I see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

I still need to learn more statistical theories and programming languages. After gradution I want to work as a data scientist.

## Differences/similarities between data scientists and statisticians?  

Statisticians deal with nebulous concepts like point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals, standard errors, p-values, hypothesis testing, and the proverbial argument between the “frequentists” and “Bayesians". Statisticians can be viewed as confusing to the general public and many times the statisticians can’t even agree on what is correct. The amount of data for statisticians rely on more traditional and smaller scale methods of data collection, such as surveys, polls, and experiments.  
Data scientists on the other hand, closely follow the “data science process” that is more approachable; data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling.
The amount of data for data scientists is often massive, consequently, they spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest, data cleansing and transformation. 

## How do I view myself in relation to these two areas?

I am in the Masters of Statistics program so definitly study about statistics. And NCSU offers SAS, R and Python courses so I study programming languages, too. It's pretty hard to memorize many functions and terms from different programming languages but I am enjoying it. After graduation I would rather be a data scientist.
