+What do I think being a data scientist is about?

It is a bit vague to define the field of data science. It should be somewhere in the middle of software engineering and statistics.
Here is a pithy definition float across many blogs:
"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician."

In these days, there is an abundance of data. I think data science is the field that can predict and prepare what you want with that lot of data.
I want to say

+What do I see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

data scientists : Data science is a concept used to tackle big data and includes data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. A data scientist gathers data from multiple sources and applies machine learning, predictive analytics, and sentiment analysis to extract critical information from the collected data sets. They understand data from a business point of view and can provide accurate predictions and insights that can be used to power critical business decisions.
skills required to become a data scientist..
Strong knowledge of Python, SAS, R, Scala
Hands-on experience in SQL database coding
Ability to work with unstructured data from various sources like video and social media
Understand multiple analytical functions
Knowledge of machine learning

statistics : 

+Differences/similarities between data scientists and statisticians?  

Statisticians deal with nebulous concepts like point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals, standard errors, p-values, hypothesis testing, and the proverbial argument between the “frequentists” and “Bayesians.” Statisticians can be viewed as confusing to the general public and many times the statisticians can’t even agree on what is correct.
Data scientists on the other hand, closely follow the “data science process” that is more approachable; data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling.
the amount of data for data scientists is often massive, consequently, they spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest, data cleansing and transformation. Conversely, statisticians still rely on more traditional and smaller scale methods of data collection, such as surveys, polls, and experiments.
While data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data.
In current terms, the fields of data science and statistics differ in a number of ways. The fields differ in modeling processes, the size of data consumed, the types of problems studied, the academic background of the people in the field, and the terminology used. At the same time, the fields are closely related in the sense that both data science and statistics aim to extract knowledge from data.
Given time, the fields of data science and statistics likely will converge to a common end-point. Statisticians have gone about gathering data and performing analysis techniques like linear regressions for several centuries. Eventually, as more statisticians pick up on skills like implementing algorithms that learn from data, and provide predictions and actions and more data scientists pick up on statistical science (sampling, experimental design, confidence intervals, p-values, etc.) the boundary between data scientists and statisticians will eventually blur.


+How do I view myself in relation to these two areas?

Statistics and data science both are very useful and important areas however if I have to choose either one of them then I would rather be a data scientist. I've been trying to learn SAS, R and Python. It's pretty hard to learn many functions and terms but I am enjoying it. It's FUN!
