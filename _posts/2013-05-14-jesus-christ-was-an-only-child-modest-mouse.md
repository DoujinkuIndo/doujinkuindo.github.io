# Jesus Christ Was An Only Child — Modest Mouse

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQLgDbs-8AI I've written before about Modest Mouse's dry, contemporary tone; mixing bitter redneck sentiments with highbrow content and literary criticism. Perhaps there is no line between _high_ and _low_ art; there is only art, and those with influences, be they one or the other. For any one crowd, the other parts of the song scream — this is not for me — and this is the desired effect, for all parties to feel like an outsider, observant and attentive, unable to immerse yourself in music for which there is no perfect audience. There is a violin solo in a song about Jesus Christ; scratching and whining in the background, lyrics about internet cash. It's phenomenal.
