## Why resuming it's important 
 When I'm talking about resuming I looking at **you** Appstore, a few weeks ago quit my job, and I've been updating my *design stuffs*, like making this blog, catching up with a few things about the internet, etc, etc.
 
 And one of the things that I was **Updating**, was **xcode**, with the new version *7.1.1* now you can run your projects in your **iDevice** without having a *developer account*, that's great for the *poor and creative* ppl like me who aren't ready to pay for a developer account but wish to see how that little experiment behaves in a real *device*.
 
 Everything's good, and nice, till we get to the point of the *shitty* internet that you have in a backpacker, even having a free *wi fi* it's like a gift, were am now, we have little *internet vouchers* of **500mb**, that means, **I NEED A BUNCH OF VOUCHERS TO DOWNLOAD THE 4.3 GB** that xcode need, and also, keep watching the download, to stop it, get another voucher, login, re-start the download, repeat... well this is the second time that I start to do another **thing** (like the blog) and I miss the *"change voucher moment"*.
 
 *And SURPRISE* **APPSTORE DOESN'T RESUME THE DOWNLOADS** thanks **apple** for nothing.
