# Oh No! — Dear and the Headlights

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nm_ahnUgo Each of these mid-tempo songs from high school is a different portal, a different facet of the outwardly-relaxed-with-a-subcurrent-of-anxiety mood that undercut most of the post-pubescent years, a passivity laced with hyperactivity that manifests in relationship drama and serious plans for the future; wildly variable project ideas, composition and destruction and all the other billions of words that have been written about puberty. This one is uniquely self-aware; he doesn't even begin to keep it together; the song becomes wailing and crying, constrained only by meter; an anthem to the joy and horror of tying your life to someone else's; this, a basic function of adulthood, as the fresh hell a young boy finds himself emerging into.
