title: Presentation Tips

Here are some presentation tips that I have used over the years. This post is also for me to put down my thoughts formally for safekeeping.

## Tip #1: Who is your audience?
Your presentation should be tailored around your audience. They can span from colleagues, students, and the greater community. 
You must be able to communicate in a way that your current audience can understand. Try to avoid using jargon or technical language with laypeople. 
Do not reuse the same presentation that you presented to specific audience to a different audience. 

## Tip #2: Words, words, words.
Do not have slides filled with words. Oftentimes, audience members can get lost in a sea of words. You will also find yourself reading off your slides and not facing the audience.
If you have presenter mode, you may add some notes but ensure that you do not fall into the habit of just reading. 
It is more engaging if you do not read off the slide but actually present while facing the audience. 

Rather than having too many words, use visuals. Generate graphics and flow charts that describe the message that you are presenting.

## Tip #3: Consistency!
Be consistent in how you prepare your slides. Do not have themes for each slide. Try to use a single theme and keep it simple. 
You want the audience to understand the science and not be distracted by changing colors texts or animations. 

## Tip #4: How do you engage your audience? 
Your slides should be informative but also allow you to lead your audience. Add your conclusion or your take-home message as the title of each slide. This ensures the audience knows what to expect from each slide. Use a question for the end of the slide to transition to the next slide. For instance, you may ask, 'Does Protein X do Action Y?,' at the end of your slide. Then your next slide may be titled, 'Protein X does action Y,' and you can show your evidence why that is. 

## Tip #5: In Medias Res

## Tip #6: Practice makes perfect. 
Don't wing it. If you want to be able to deliver your message well, practice! Practice what you will say so you will know what to say when the time comes. Practice your delivery and catch yourself when you use filler words, like 'um' and 'you know'. Try to record your presentation if you can so you can see how the audience would perceive you.
