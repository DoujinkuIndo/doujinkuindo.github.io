title: Presentation Tips

Here are some presentation tips that I have used over the years. This post is also for me to put down my thoughts formally for safekeeping.

## Tip #1: Who is your audience?
Your presentation should tailored around your audience. They can span from colleagues, students, and the greater community. 
You must be able to communicate in a way that your current audience can understand. Avoid using jargon or technical language with laypeople. 
Do not reuse the same presentation that you presented to specific audience to a different audience. 

## Tip #2: Words, words, words.
Do not have slides filled with words. Oftentimes, audience members can get lost in a sea of words. You will also find yourself reading off your slides and not facing the audience.
If you have presenter mode, you may add some notes but ensure that you do not fall into the habit of just reading. 
It is more engaging if you do not read off the slide but actually present while facing the audience. 

Rather than having too many words, use visuals. Generate graphics and flow charts that describe the message that you are presenting.

## Tip #3: Consistency!
Be consistent in how you prepare your slides. Do not have themes for each slide. Try to use a single theme and keep it simple. 
You want the audience to understand the science and not be distracted by changing colors texts or animations. 

## Tip #4: How do you engage your audience?
