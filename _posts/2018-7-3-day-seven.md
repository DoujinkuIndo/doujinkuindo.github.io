Today is about trying new methods for getting a running photometry code. After reading [Marta's blog](https://gosnellgroup-marta.blogspot.com/) yesterday, the first thing that I thought was "this will be useful for learning astrometry," but I realized this morning that the process she went through to produce her code is almost exactly what I'm doing. So, I decided to use a few ideas that I got from reading her blog to help my coding today. With these ideas in mind, I spent much of today looking back at [photometry_practice_updated.py](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20practice/photometry_practice_updated.py) (the first code I was working with) and writing new versions of it that focus only on specific aspects of photometry and whose annotations focus only on explaining how the code does what it does rather than me describing what I went through to make the code work (what I'm calling "clean annotation"). These will be more useful in actually performing photometry on the data relevant to this project.  

## Github 
I decided to create a new [folder](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/tree/master/photometry%20codes) called "photometry codes" in the [NGC6819 repo](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819) that contains the new, cleanly annotated photometry codes that I'm writing. I'm still going to keep [photometry_practice_updated.py](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20practice/photometry_practice_updated.py) in the photometry practice [folder](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/tree/master/photometry%20practice) and continue to work on it as both a way of continuing to learn photometry and a way to keep a record of what I did while learning it, but the codes in [photometry codes](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/tree/master/photometry%20codes) will serve a different purpose. They'll be what we actually use on our data to extract information from the measurements and may be more informative. There will be multiple codes because each one will perform a specific task. I may write a master code that does everything at once, but I can't predict right now whether or not that will be useful. 

## Working on Code
One of the things I realized after reading [Marta's blog](https://gosnellgroup-marta.blogspot.com/) is that so far I've been putting too much hope in [photometry_practice_updated.py](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20practice/photometry_practice_updated.py) to give me finished photometry after it runs properly, but I need to branch out to new resources -- I can use Google to find other codes or websites like astronomy.net to help me write this code then frankenstein whatever I find in with the code I'm writing to make something that actually works and that I understand. This realization is why I decided to create [photometry codes](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/tree/master/photometry%20codes). 

Since the first part of [photometry_practice_updated.py](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20practice/photometry_practice_updated.py) deals with source detection, writing a code that just just detects sources in an image was my first goal. Marta helped me out a lot here; she helped me figure out how to bring .fits files into the [new code](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20codes/source_detection.py) and worked with me to try to make the [code](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20codes/source_detection.py) iterative so the code processes all the .fits files in a particular directory at once. Without too much pain, I was able to make the first diagram that used data relevant to this project:
