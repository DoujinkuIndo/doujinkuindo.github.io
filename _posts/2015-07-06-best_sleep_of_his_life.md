excerpt: There's a certain radio talk show host who recently been hawking some pillow, saying that now that he has it he's having the best sleep of his life and that before he'd never slept well. Previously he hawked some mattress, again saying when he used it, it was the best sleep of his life and that before he'd never slept well. I'm confused.
