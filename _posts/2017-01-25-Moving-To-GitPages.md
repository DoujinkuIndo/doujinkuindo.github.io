I've gone hacker!

Well, *sort of.* 

I have been on Medium.com for quite some time but it was time for a change. Welcome to my new GitPages powered website! It's is static, which means it'll load super fast! It also means it's easier for me to manage as well as customize. I get the power of github along with free hosting which is pretty sweet.
