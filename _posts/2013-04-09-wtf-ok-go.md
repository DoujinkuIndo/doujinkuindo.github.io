# WTF? — OK Go

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zJw9varYE Back in 2009 — this was ninth grade for me, god DAMN — this was the most inventive, cutting-edge music known to middle school boy, a techy pop song in 5/4, with a high-tech music video, inventive and fun and energetic and brilliant, exultant and thrilled in itself — in touch with cultural acronyms, hip without trying terribly hard to be "_in touch with the kids_", made entirely out of good-natured fun. No, really, go look up some other OK Go videos on YouTube or whatever. This is all they do. Their first hit, the treadmills thing that went viral in 2006 on a very early internet, and they've been doing the same shit ever since. God bless OK Go.
