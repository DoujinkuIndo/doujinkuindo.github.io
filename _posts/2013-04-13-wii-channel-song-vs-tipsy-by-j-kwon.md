# Wii Channel Song Vs. "Tipsy" by J-Kwon

[embed]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wy3iCGi7u8[/embed] Let's for a moment psychanalyze; what sort of person would create something like this? Who would take the theme music from a loading screen, something innocent and ubiquitous, made for children, suitable for all ages, animated and mass-marketed, unable to offend, unable to communicate, the musical equivalent of the smiley face icon; who would listen to this and think: "Y'know what'd be dope? Let's chop this up and put _Tipsy_ over it." Tipsy is nearly _ten years old_, for Christ's sake. This is brilliant.
