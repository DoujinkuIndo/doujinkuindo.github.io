## Things we learned 

There were a lot of things we were able to learn during the course.
There are a couple of obvious things we learn. For example we created a unity game, which improved our C# skills since unity uses C#.
While we created new code, we had to refactor our own old code and improve it.
We were also able to learn about modeling of characters and a game world in general. There have been multiple occasions were we learned how hard it can be to create the simpleset of a level. You have to consider alot of different thing, especially the "user that wants to break stuff". 
We had to change our levels numerous times in order for them to provide the gameplay we are aiming at.
Another thing we never really thought about was the time it takes to create a 3D environment. It take way more effort than we thought.

Since we created the game with unity we were able to learn about the ins and outs of unity. Unity provides a lot of useful features, but if you are not aware of how unity does certain thing, you can ran into problems.

Since we were working in a team, we were able improve our team work skills. This started with the planning of the project. We had to communicate a lot in the group.
The use of the version control system git allowed us the efficently work together and we had the ability to tests out a couple different things using Git.
We tested out GitHub pages to create this blog, and we were impressed how easy it is. 
Another thing we were not expecting is the fast you can make your game publicly available.
We used the WebGL build feature unity provides to create a WebGL build. We were than able to upload this build GitHub pages and provide a way to play the game in a browser.
If you click ![here]("../game/index.html") or on the "Play it Now!" button you can test it out yourself!

Next to the game itself we had to think about the user that is supposed to play the game. We weren't ablt the just code a game and call it done, we had to think about our users behavior and adapt accordingly. To help us understand our users we created some analytics.
We learned alot about creating them and how you could use them to improve the game. 
Unity provides a free, easy to use analytics service that we could enable ad use to our own liking.
