Normalized audio

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRQviAdxt5I" %}

Sample, of me playing at very low volume, most mumbling level

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLk61WS2du4" %}

so I addede another uh video that's well known

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTTPlqK8AnY" %}

<omitted it here, it didn't render page correctly when i had this up>

woops, I have to make a 3rd file because prose.io has the default name set to "2016-08-25_OBStest.md" causing me to have to rename files and save new ones.

my page crashed. supposedly.



okay, i have to select another solution later.
Plugin. Potentially have to host my own page I think. I don't think I can access github's server files for this jekyll site, I am not sure how it works since ican't see backend or anyhting like cpanel
