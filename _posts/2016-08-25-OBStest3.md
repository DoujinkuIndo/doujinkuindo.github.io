so I addede another uh video that's well known

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTTPlqK8AnY" %}

hopefully this one at least works.

woops, I have to make a 3rd file because prose.io has the default name set to "2016-08-25_OBStest.md" causing me to have to rename files and save new ones.
