title: New site!
---

This site represents a newfound, twofold and quite procrastinory interest in learning some more technical skills and trying to sell myself as an Ancient Historian about to finish his PhD. I've therefore built this in [Jekyll,](https://jekyllrb.com/) a way to build static sites in command line. Or rather, I forked an already working version called [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
