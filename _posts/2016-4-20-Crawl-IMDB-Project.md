I am learning scraping content on the web. There are a few open source web scraping tools like Scapy, Selenium, BeautifulSoap, Google Web Scraper etc. A guide to web scraping tools ["http://www.garethjames.net/a-guide-to-web-scrapping-tools/"] gave nice comparasion between Web Scrapers. I am learning Python therefore I choose to use Scrapy, 100% written in Python and has a lot of built-in functionality.

##Installation
I followed Scrapy Developer Document - Installation Guide ["http://doc.scrapy.org/en/master/intro/install.html"] for Installing Scrapy. Checked for Prerequisties, installed Scrapy by run this: <<pip install scrapy >>.

After installed, this tutorial ["http://doc.scrapy.org/en/master/intro/tutorial.html"] to get myself familiar with Scrapy Framework.
