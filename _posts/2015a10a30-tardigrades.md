Tardigrades(water bears) have become the unofficial lab pet, partially because UT won't let us have vertebrates, but mainly because of how awesome and wierd they are. This [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/science/the-tardigrade-water-bear.html?_r=0) is a great introduction to this eight-legged, funny-faced animal.  Water bears fall phylogenetically somewhere between arthropods and nematodes, and spend most of their time hanging out on algae clumps and [ineffectively swimming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl-9bSv27WU) with their stubby little legs. While water bears are generally adorable, they are most notorious for their ability to survive complete dehydration, freezing, and the cold vacuum of space.  

In the break room one day, Ophelia and I realized that water bears kind of look like living gummy bears.  Water bears. Gummy bears.  We needed make water bear gummy bears!  

Following some false starts with clay models, I decided to 3D print a plastic positive mold, and then use it to make a silicon candy mold. Using openSCAD, I made a series of a water bears in the style of a gummy bears, seated in a tray to contain the silicon.

After the MakerBot printed a too small and right sized mold, I mixed up some food grade silicon, and left it to set in the molds overnight.

One trip to the grocery store bulk section later, I had a ton of gummy bears. Too many gummy bears.

I melted groups of colored gummies in the microwave, since the stovetop gave my trial run a strange flavor. After the molten mass of sugar had cooled enough to handle, I pressed balls of gummy substance into each mold. Wetting my hands made the melted gummy much easier to handle.For the clear gummies, I also added green sprinkles to simulate to balls of digested algae visible in the translucent water bear body under a light microscope. Twenty minutes in the freezer solified the water bear gummies enough for removal from the mold. At this point, the texture seemed all wrong, much too soft and gooey.  However, the signature gummy bear consistency returned after overnight in the refrigerator on an oiled baking tray. Also, a spray of canola oil over all the bears in the morning reduced the stickiness.

It wasn't a very high throughput process, but I ended up with a good number of gummy water bears, which were enjoyed at lab meeting.
