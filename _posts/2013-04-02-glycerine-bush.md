# Glycerine — Bush

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOllF3TgAsM The first year I went to summer camp, I saw a TV advert for _Buzz Ballads, _a 90s rock compilation CD; I was taken aback by music totally unlike what they'd play on the radio, unlike what my parents listened to; unlike what my friends knew. I looked up some of the songs and listened to the 30-second iTunes samples; spent $14.85 on 15 of the 99c tracks. These became my first trigger songs; they would perfectly recall the people and places of that first summer at Mount Holyoke college in Pennsylvania; the layouts of the classrooms and dorms and mess halls; where we'd sit in the dining halls and the styles of furnitures; the low lighting of pre-war college architecture and the smell of old wood; the titanic rainstorm that hit partway through and stranded us in one of the academic buildings for the better part of a day: the feelings of confusion and lovesickness and homesickness that would surface during the dances. The songs weren't about these things at all, but Glycerine came closest.
