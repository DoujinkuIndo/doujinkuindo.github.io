It was jam-packed crowd at Codenode for our August 2019 Cloud Native London Meetup!

As always, thanks to our sponsors [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Contino](https://www.contino.io/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/),  [Twistlock](https://www.twistlock.com/), [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/), [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/), and [Mysterium Networks](https://mysterium.network/) for making this all possible!


We only had two speakers this month, which meant more time for networking down the pub! First up was a talk on container costs, then we had a discussion on running community projects on Kubernetes. Check out the full videos of their talks below!
