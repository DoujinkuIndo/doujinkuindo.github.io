&hellip;a new fantastic point of view.

The time has come. My web presence is moving to GitHub Pages, and will be powered by Jekyll.

While I still believe in the value of a CMS like WordPress for most end-users, I've been craving a minimalistic, text-oriented workflow like the one that Jekyll offers for my own site for a long time.

It impressed me how quickly things came together, and the color scheme is pretty telling of all the [outrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G22X5X49VhM&list=PLHQ0xKUMxXGv8Hed5TgzzCgT2YPIivJXs) and [synthwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yergWdn968o) I've been listening to lately.

I struggled to justify migrating the posts from my [old site](http://thinkontheclock.com), but I'm kinda diggin' the scorched-earth feel. I may archive them and cherry pick some of the good or nostalgic ones. The most visited post was on how to open Internet Explorer from a run dialog in Windows. *Yikes*.
