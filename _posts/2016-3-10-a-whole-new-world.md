&hellip;a new fantastic point of view.

The time has come. My web presence is moving to GitHub Pages, and will be powered by Jekyll.

While I still believe in the value of a CMS like WordPress for most end-users, I've been craving a minimalistic, text-oriented workflow like the one that Jekyll offers for my own site for a long time.

Over the next few days, I'll cherry pick the best posts from my [other site](http://thinkontheclock.com) (the most visited post on my old blog is about how to start Internet Explorer from the run dialog on Windows - yikes) and migrate them here.
