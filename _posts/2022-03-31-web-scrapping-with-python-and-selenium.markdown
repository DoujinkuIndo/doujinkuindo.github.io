# Summary
Hi Guys!, So I recently completed a side project to practice python and selenium.
The Goal of this project is to grab a job title from indeed job site's search results.
To complete this goal, we are going to use python to code a script which will use selenium and beautifulsoup.
And Pandas library for creating a CSV file of the data we have collected.

# Tools
I am using Pycharm with python 3.8 as my virtual environment.
 - Selenium library 4.1.3
 - Pandas 1.4.2
 - beautifulsoup4 4.11.1
