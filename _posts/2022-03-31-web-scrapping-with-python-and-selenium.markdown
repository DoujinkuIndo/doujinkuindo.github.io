# Summary
I recently completed a side project to practice Python and Selenium. The goal of this project was to scrape job titles from Indeed's search results and store them in a CSV file using Pandas. To achieve this, I wrote a Python script that used Selenium and Beautiful Soup to navigate the website and extract the desired data.

# Tools
I am using Pycharm with python 3.8 as my virtual environment.
 - Selenium library 4.1.3
 - Pandas 1.4.2
 - beautifulsoup4 4.11.1
