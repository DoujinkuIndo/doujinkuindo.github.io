title: Grief Album Release - April 10th, 2021
---
I'm releasing my debut album, **Grief**, as **Taylor J Hawkins**, on **April 10th, 2021**. 
It will be available on Spotify, ITunes, and 

The material was mostly recorded between 2011-2013, and I've recently used it for learning a new mastering workflow with [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), my current DAW, in my new home studio.

The material was originally intended as a video game soundtrack, and as such, it is instrumental in nature focusing predominantly on electronic instrumentation, although guitars are also featured in the mix.
