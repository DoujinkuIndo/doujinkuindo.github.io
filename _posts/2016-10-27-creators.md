In this blog post, Iâ€™d discuss which players (top 5 leagues in Europe) have been crucial to their teams explicitly, i.e, through creating chances, primary assists and secondary assists for their respective teams.

Before actually discussing the observations, I hope you are familiar with what assists and second assists are.

An assist is a contribution by a player which helps to score a goal. It can be a direct pass (by foot/headed), a player who wins the penalty which leads to goal, a tackle which led to a chance and eventually a goal. Similarly, a second assist is the pass which leads to the eventual assist and goal.

Comparison of top creators across leagues in Europe. This is to understand the players who are important to their team in attacking sense. Christian Eriksen has been really important for his team. De Bruyne is a man in a league of his own, and well you all already knew about that.
