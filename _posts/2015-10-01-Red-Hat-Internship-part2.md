title: Summer Internship at Red Hat - Part 2
---

Yesterday was my last day at Red Hat (for now).
It was a wonderful 2.5 months and a brand new experience for me, and I'm quite sad it all ended so soon.
New things await me - my second year at [Matfyz](http://mff.cuni.cz) starts in less than a week.

First of all, I want to thank [Geoffrey](https://github.com/ge0ffrey) for contacting me
[in the spring]({{site.url}}/My-first-year-at-Matfyz/) about such a position being opened,
and for all the support, feedback, criticism, ideas and concepts he shared with me.

Second, my manager, [Shelly](https://github.com/smcgowan) for hiring me in the first place,
and for her support during the whole course of my internship. I have to mention [Petr](https://github.com/psiroky)
for helping me with my first days at Red Hat and for all technical and non-technical help during my stay.

Lastly, I can't forget the whole [KIE Group](http://kiegroup.org/)
- the [developement team](https://github.com/droolsjbpm) and the QE team - which I sat next to in the Brno office.
More specifically, thanks to all [contributors of OptaPlanner](http://www.optaplanner.org/community/team.html).

Thank you [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/en) for being such an awesome company.
Let's see what next year has in store for me!

TODO: P.S.: Here is [a lengthy report]({{site.url}}/docs/2015redhat-did.txt),
of what I actually [did](https://github.com/psss/did) during my internship!
