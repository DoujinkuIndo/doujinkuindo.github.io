# In Your Eyes (Extended Mix) — Peter Gabriel

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5sgYYE-J3w To find out suddenly that one of your favorite songs, imbued with significance over many years, played on repeat, sometimes laughed, cried over; company on train rides and slow dances and drenched in adolescent hormones; to know a hundred other people who all attribute the same significance to this song, so regarded it's nearly scripture; to find out that this song, a song I once recognized from the triangle line alone, able to hear the treble on the speakers in a Starbucks through another song I was listening to, to be jolted to attention by a mere fraction of this song; to find out that this one song I'd been listening to for all these years was but a part of another, longer song, a deconstruction thereof, beginning and ending with extra content, isolated motifs from the height of the song — the sudden, deep, _in your eyes _that first appears around the 1:12 mark, the verses at the climax sung in Wolof — to disassemble a pop song whose parts have never been dissociated — and better yet, for it to be done not as sacrilege, but as part of the original intention, like finding a new book of the New Testament — I cannot express.
