The Ha√ßienda must built! 

During the last few months, I have been reflecting on my work practise, something I have not systematically done for a number of years. I concluded that nothing encourages clear and critical thinking like writing "stuff" down. This is the place where I am going to post my writing and share my 'short thoughts'. 

The "stuff" I write about, will form a series of articles on the practice of solving business problems through web-based technology. That is the initial plan at least. My eight years of using Drupal will form the core of this work, but I will range as far and wide as I feel is useful. From past experience, there will also be articles on guitars, performing music and bicycles, amongst other interests of mine.

While my writing is fundamentally a mechanism for thinking, ideas are stronger when  challenged, defended and refined. Feel free to disagree wildly in the comments section.
