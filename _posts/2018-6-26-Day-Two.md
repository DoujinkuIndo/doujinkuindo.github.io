Today was about trying to get to photometry. When I came in this morning, I discovered that the HST failed to download with only about three folders of .fits files left. Luckily, I was able to keep what had already been downloaded and only had to download those last three folders. Also, my collaborator Rory's laptop wasn't able to download the HLA data, but the more powerful Macs in the computational lab were able to handle the download. Rory did go through the process correctly, however. With the Diafi data, we now have all the data we need. I also had to spend a lot of time this morning finishing the set up of my blog. On the upside, I now understand Github a lot better, and feel like I can use it for what I need to this summer. With all that, I didn't get to photometry until the afternoon.

# Photometry
I actually started out the afternoon with a quick review of markdown language for Jekell, which is easy to use, but then started doing the exercises that were on one of the resource pages Dr. G sent us. The file that I used to practice phtotometry using phtotutils is available [here]({{thom-ory.github.io}}/files/practice_photometry.py "Practice Photometry"), and contains detailed annotations about what I did while going through these exercises. 

### Exercise One
The first exercise, after learning the set-up code required to run this program in the Mac terminal, was to learn how to produce an image. The default image that running the code gave is below:

#### Exercise One Results 
![Figure One]({{thom-ory.github.io}}/images/figure-one.png "Figure One") 

### Exercise Two
The next exercise involved source detection. The first part of the code was a statistical analyzer, which gave mean, median and standard deviation results respectively: 

#### Exercise Two Results, pt. 1 
{3667.779240018601, 3649.0, 204.27923665845705}. 

The next part of this code attempts to detect sources in the image, but I've run out of time in the work day at 6:45pm to continue. This, along with trying to customize this code to analyze my data, is the next for me.

# Conclusion
Today felt like it got cut short, but I came out of it with a better ability to work Github and a new understanding of how to use python for photometry, as well as a clear path forward. My main focuses for tomorrow are finishing these exercises, reading what I need from the textbook _Python for Astronomers_, and using all that to be able to run some photometry codes on our data.
