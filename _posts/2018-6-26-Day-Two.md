Today was about trying to get to photometry. When I came in this morning, I discovered that the HST failed to download with only about three folders of .fits files left. Luckily, I was able to keep what had already been downloaded and only had to download those last three folders. Also, my collaborator Rory's laptop wasn't able to download the HLA data, but the more powerful Macs in the computational lab were able to handle the download. Rory did go through the process correctly, however. With the Diafi data, we now have all the data we need. I also had to spend a lot of time this morning finishing the set up of my blog. On the upside, I now understand Github a lot better, and feel like I can use it for what I need to this summer. With all that, I didn't get to photometry until the afternoon.

### Photometry
I actually started out the afternoon with a quick review of markdown language for Jekell, which is easy to use, but then started doing the exercises that were on one of the resource pages Dr. G sent us. The file that I used to practice phtotometry using phtotutils is available [here]({{thom-ory.github.io}}/files/practice_photometry.py "Practice Photometry"), and contains detailed annotations about what I did while going through these exercises. 

The first exercise, after learning the set-up code required to run this program in the Mac terminal, was to learn how to produce an image. The default image that running the code gave was Figure One below:

![Figure One]({{thom-ory.github.io}}/images/figure-one.png "Figure One") 

The next exercise involved source detection.
