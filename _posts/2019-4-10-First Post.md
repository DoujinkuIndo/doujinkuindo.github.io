Welcome to my blog, it is definitely a work in progress at this very moment, and it is 2:01 AM, so I will keep this short. This project was forked straight from Jekyll-Now. I tried running a Gatsby set-up, because I would prefer to have React, but Jekyll has better integration with Github Pages, so here we are.
