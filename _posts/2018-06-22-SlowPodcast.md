Slow movement

Slow movement is a concept that stresses the importance of "slowing down in a world that is obsessed with speed". Slow movement encourages people to set aside distractions such as social media and electronics and enjoy each other's company. Guy Michlin says a good way to start implementing slow movement concepts in your life is to dine with others, without electronics (Michlin, Come Dine With Me, Slowly). By dining "slow" you will get to know others better and enjoy each other's company. Slow movement also promotes health and stress relief. Slowing down allows more time to reflect and focus on your health. By putting down the electronics and slowing down your daily pace, you will reduce stress in your life. Finally, by implementing slow movement in your life, you will be able to strengthen bonds between yourself and friends/family. Slow movement will help strengthen relationships because it will allow you to spend more quality time with your friends and family members. The company EatWith, founded by Guy Michlin, was created to bring people together to enjoy a "slow" meal together without distractions.

There are some challenges associated with the slow movement. One common challenge is overcoming the social normality of a fast paced life. By implementing slow movement in your life you will go against what the modern world thinks of as normal. The challenge of implementing slow movement into your daily life can be easily overcome by introducing slow movement to your friends and family. Another challenge with slow movement is finding the time to implement this concept. The speed of the world is very fast and there is pressure to comply to this speed by bosses and family members. A challenge with slow movement is finding a good pace that works with your life and with the others around you. The last challenge with the slow movement is finding others who also live a "slow" life. Many people feel the pressure to be constantly checking their phones and live a fast paced life. You cannot change the way other people work and carry out their day. Therefore, a challenge with the slow movement is finding others who will live a "slow" life with you.

I would like to implement some parts of the slow movement in my life. I think it will help with my stress levels and the relationships I have with my family and friends. I plan on trying to make small changes every day to ensure some "slow" aspects are in my life. One thing I plan on doing is using my phone less. I also plan on sitting down and enjoying family dinners more often, with no distractions. These are just a few small changes I will make that will greatly benefit my health and my relationships with friends and family members.
