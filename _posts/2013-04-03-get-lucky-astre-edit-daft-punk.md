# Get Lucky (Astre Edit) — Daft Punk

https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mh9eJJ8cKsU#! Daft Punk — I speak from a tiny, tiny experience with them and their library — inhabits that range of sound that, if you know the source, you can tell it's sampled; if you don't, it's pure sound, from _tabula rasa_, no identifiable synths or strings or what. It's all just full tones and sweeps and fast glitches, and it's too much to parse or understand; maybe it's voice, or it was voice, or maybe it'd be clear if I could understand the french accent buried underneath layers of processing; the background was once drums, filtered and chained through 808s and reverbs and compressors; now they're just flittering hits and withdrawals of bass and treble tones, a crash or a pound or a bump here or there. With any experience in pop music, this is perfectly normal, but imagine someone a hundred, two hundred years listening — the chords and rhythms are rational enough, but the arrangement is beyond imagination. What does another hunded hold?
