Hello, 

My name is Lioncel Lin, and I am a senior at Texas A&M University studying in Technology Management in the Department of Education and Human Resources.
I am planning to graduate by Summer of 2018 with my Bachelors, though things may or may not go to plan, though time will tell.

My hobbies are playing lots and lots of video games, and occassionally fishing.
I like fishing due to being able to enjoy the scenary while having the small thrills of reeling in a fish.

I have one pet cat named Ezra that originally wasn't mine, but instead was my sister's cat, but she sort of gave up owning him and then went and adopted a corgi that she lovingly cares for.
Though Ezra can be aggressive, he is a loving cat.
