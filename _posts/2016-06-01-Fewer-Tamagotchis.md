title: Fewer Tamagotchis
---

During the first episode of [Lady Dynamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Dynamite), Maria Bamford suggests to her agent that she'd like to do for her next project is...less. She doesn't want to do movies or TV or even commercials. She'd like to, maybe, just sit on a park bench in her neighbourhood. That seems like less stress and pressure to her character. 

This is how I feel about social media, chatting, apps, and connectivity lately. 

For the last fifteen years or so, my online presence has taken up innumerable hours. Most of it is spent talking to other people. Sometimes it's just me talking to the void. Both can be good things! Both can be productive uses of time. But in the last few years, I've noticed things splintering. I've seen segmentation, and it seems like everyone is just a little farther away than they used to be. 

Maybe I'm just getting old. Maybe everyone is having fun without me. Maybe my patience for online time-wasting has reached a plateau and I need to spend some time away. 

This is not me turning into someone who doesn't like computers or technology anymore. I don't wish to go back to any sort of previous version of things. Online communication has always kind of sucked. If anything, I'd just like some streamlining. I think I just want one feed. I want one place to chat. I want one place to see new things. 

Recently on You Chose Poorly, a podcast I do with Mikey Llorin, I talked about the proliferation of chat apps in my life. Here was the list of apps I have used to chat with people in the last month:   

* iMessage/SMS
* Facebook Messenger
* WhatsApp
* Google Hangouts
* Slack
* Miitomo
* Skype
* Twitter
* Instagram
* Tumblr

And that's just not feasible. This is a crazytown way to live. So I've decided to do some pruning. I'd like to start by getting this down to 3. It's not one, but one is the eventual higher-plane goal. Three will do as a first step. 

Obviously iMessage isn't something you can get rid of if you have an iPhone, but it's also not something I check. If someone texts me, I'll get a notification. I consider this swiped off with some tweaks to notification centre. 

I only had Instagram for quick posts to Facebook and Twitter. That's an easy one to cut out. So I've "temporarily disabled" my account, since Instagram is a Facebook joint and deleting things just isn't their jam. 

Miitomo and Slack were fun distractions, but are kind of tedious. Gone. 

Google hangouts is pretty dead, at least among my friends. Logged out. Uninstalled. 

And Skype is something I'll have to keep around for podcasts, but can stop signing into at all times. I can take it off my phone. 

So now there's: 

* WhatsApp
* Facebook & Messenger
* Twitter

It's not perfect, but it's progress. 

There's also one more thing I'm going to cut out for a little while: Fitbit. 

For the last year, Fitbit has been my Tamogotchi. It's a dingus I feed with health metadata. I've logged my food. I've slept with it on. I've taken care of my side of things. In return, I've gotten a great deal of data about myself. Some of it is helpful! But a lot of it is just confirming assumed knowledge. I sleep better when I exercise. I eat poorly on days when I walk less. I walk between 10,000 and 13,000 steps every day, and I more often than not hit Fitbit's targets for daily activity. I'm not great about making sure I walk 250 steps every hour during the work day (it's newest feature), but Fitbit is also lousy about reminding me. 

What I'm trying to say is that this data is valuable, but it's also predictable. I know when I've had a healthy and an unhealthy day. And to extend this, Fitbit has not motivated me to the point of any physical change. I'm the same weight and at the same approximate fitness level I was last summer. 

I'm not getting rid of my Fitbit. I'll still wear it every few days, and during isolated exercises (the whole reason I got the thing was to track bike rides with GPS). But it's not going to be something I worry about every day. Fitbit's numbers will say I'm doing less, but that's okay. Less is kind of what I'm into right now.
