My [review of Legend of Vyas](http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/03/kickstarter-previewdragoon/), by Vansh Games, went up today on Purple Pawn.  The game is a CCG based on the Indian epic, The Mahabharata. Along with it being a great game, the box and components are top notch.

I'm looking forward to future card releases, as we had a ton of fun with this.
