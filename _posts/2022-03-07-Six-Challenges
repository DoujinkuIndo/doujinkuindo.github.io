title: Six Challenges for Working in Corporate IT
---

Tech Twitter is the reason I've used Twitter for almost 15 years. The resources generously shared by my fellow software developers helped me learn, grow, and stay current in the industry. However, Tech Twitter is limited to the latest technologies and typically covers startups and young fresh companies.

It doesn't tweet too much about life in corporate IT. Corporate IT isn't sexy; it doesn't use the latest technology and is often where software engineers ride out their careers or hide in the shadows. Here are six things a developer needs to be okay with to succeed in corporate IT.

## You have to be okay working with legacy code.

Every company has tired old legacy code. When I started my career, I still had to maintain code written in COBOL and RPG III. In my current company, we're stuck supporting undocumented Lotus Notes databases. Everyone has to dip their toes in the legacy code so everyone can dip their toes in the new stuff.

## You have to be okay with interruptions from operations.

Help desk support tickets are a fact of life in any deployed system. You'll need to understand that supporting the business means having to stop greenfield development to fix a production bug.

## You have to be okay with meetings.

Corporate IT answers to the business. The business needs to explain its needs, and that happens in meetings.

## You have to be okay with delays.

Every person in IT is stretched beyond their capacity, and new feature changes aren't always prioritized. Sometimes your blocker is low on another team's to do list. So you wait. 

## You have to be okay with buying off-the-shelf.

Executive leadership knows the track record of IT. Despite how much we'd love to write that cool tool ourselves, there's frequently a business case for purchasing an existing application or subscription.

## You have to be okay with learning on your own.

Training for every part of your job won't happen in corporate IT. A lot of the time those undocumented systems were designed by people who left the company years ago. You must have a sense of adventure and self-learning to find your way around those systems.
