## What can this be used for

## Problem definition

So what do we mean when we say we want to classify documents, in precise terms? Ideally we want to formulate the problem in mathematical terms, since we're going to be solving it with math. Having such a precise formulation also helps us check if the tools available help us solve the problem at hand (eg. assigning pre-defined categories to news title). It can also help us spot ambiguities or missing information important to solving the problem. An article having two titles might be an issue, and we can spot this more easily if we are aware of the formal definition.

So lets get down to the actual defintion. We define the following objects for our problem:

1. We have a domain of documents we call $D$.
2. We have a pre-defined set of categories $C = \\{ c_1, \cdots, c_K \\}$.
3.
