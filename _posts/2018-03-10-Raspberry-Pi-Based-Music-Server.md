# Using as Raspberry Pi as a Music Server

**The Problem**
I have a reasonably large collection of music files (about 80GB), which I keep on my laptop hard drive. I love the convenience of storing/playing music as files, and have been progressively ripping and mothballing my CD/Vinyl/Cassette collection over the years. 

However, I am still quite old school in that I like to listen to my music through my 20 year old separates hifi. You would have thought that there would be a reliable way of doing this, but apparently not.

I've tried a number of solutions with varying degrees of success over the years, including:

* Stream from iTunes on my laptop via AirPort Express
* Upload all my music to a free Google Play account, then stream via a Google Chromecast Audio
* Connect iPod Classic to hifi via a dedicated docking station
* Stream from Spotify via a Google Chromecast Audio

There main problems with these approaches are:
* Streaming dropouts - very annoying!
* Having to use laptop to control music playback
* Spotify is great, but has a lot of gaps in its catalogue

**Requirements**
In summary:
* Direct connection to my existing hifi amplifier - no streaming!
* Store all my music files
* Remote control
* Hifi sound quality (obviously within the parameters of file compression etc)

I searched for solutions online. There are a few components available which meet the above criteria, but they are all really expensive (eg [Brennan](http://www.brennan.co.uk/units) - around £500). The market has decided that streaming is the way forward!
