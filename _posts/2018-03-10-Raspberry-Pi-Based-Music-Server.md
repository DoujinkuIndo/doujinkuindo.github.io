# Using as Raspberry Pi as a Music Server

**The Problem**
I have a reasonably large collection of music files (about 80GB), which I keep on my laptop hard drive. I love the convenience of storing/playing music as files, and have been gradually mothballing my CD/Vinyl/Cassette collection over the years. 

However, I am quite old school in that I like to listen to my music through my 20 year old separates hifi. I've tried a number of solutions with varying degrees of success:

* Stream from iTunes on my laptop via AirPort
* Upload all my music to a free Google Play account, then stream via a Google Chromecast Audio
* Connect iPod Classic to hifi via a dedicated docking station
