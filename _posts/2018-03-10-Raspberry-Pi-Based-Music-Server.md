# Using as Raspberry Pi as a Music Server

**The Problem**
I have a reasonably large collection of music files (about 80GB), which I keep on my laptop hard drive. I love the convenience of storing/playing music as files, and have been progressively ripping and mothballing my CD/Vinyl/Cassette collection over the years. 

However, I am still quite old school in that I like to listen to my music through my 20 year old separates hifi. You would have thought that there would be a reliable way of doing this, but apparently not.

I've tried a number of solutions with varying degrees of success over the years, including:

* Stream from iTunes on my laptop via AirPort Express
* Upload all my music to a free Google Play account, then stream via a Google Chromecast Audio
* Connect iPod Classic to hifi via a dedicated docking station

The main problem with all of these is the glitchiness of the streaming - they will work intermittently or not at all.

**The Solution**
Use a Raspberry Pi
