Spotted this great list of open source tools for system administrators:
[24 Great Open Source Apps for Admins & Technicians](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/10/01/24-great-open-source-apps-for-admins-and-technicians/).

I can personally vouch for a number of these:*Angry IP Scanner


*PuTTY


*DBAN


*DeltaCopy

For some tools that are not open source but free, you can't go past
[live.sysinternals.com](http://live.sysinternals.com) (
[details here](http://sysinternals.com/)) - now owned by Microsoft themselves these tools make a Windows Sysadmin job much easier.
