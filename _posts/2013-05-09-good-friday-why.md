# Good Friday — Why?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXmCIlGstfY Why? is indie hip-hop, rock and pop and rap and weird, confessional, dirty secrets and wordplay, jazz rhythms and one of the best singers — and worst singers — I've ever heard, evocative and specific and tuned in to just the right weird, dark frequency, talented beyond measure and yet almost impossibly rough around the edges. This music is produced and careful, maybe samples, maybe synths — it sounds like Beck and Aesop Rock and Andrew Jackson Jihad — and, like a lot of modern hip-hop, it gets its rocks off on being nasty and different. Like punk, it doesn't care. Like pop, it needs riffs, bells, backing vocals. And it's relaxed and frantic and listenable, different from almost everything else — not easy to listen to, but worth the while, as so much music is.
