Can parks meet its dual mandate of access and protection?

For parks to be sustainable they need to support themselves to a certain extent. Giving people access to these parks is necessary to maintain the balance. It is crucial for them to both provide access to people and protect the species within.

I believe that parks can meet this requirement of access and protection, and I think it is important that they do. They can achieve access and protection by placing barriers around certain areas of the park that are more sensitive to human activity. They can place more waste containers for humans in the park as well to reduce littering. They can offer tours in the major parks which can promote knowledge about the environment, and how to protect it.
