# La Femme D'Argent — Air

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5bL_XbO64 A confession: I don't listen to that much new music. I tend to binge, to take large amounts of music in at once and then slowly churn and process and digest and listen to it over years, slowly discovering album by album, often on shuffle. It's not healthy. I got a new music dump today: sorted alphabetically, the first band is Air; the first album is Moon Safari; the first track is _La Femme D'Argent._ It is like a breath of fresh air. This experiment has mostly been about my past with music; how I felt about it, how I think about it, the context in which I remember it. But I'm going to try to listen to more new music. This will be part of it, and I'm going to have to think about it while I listen to it. No more passivity.
