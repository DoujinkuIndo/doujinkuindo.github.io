    <td>Talking and creating a scratch game using code.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To use scratch and code my sprite so that it can do certain things such as moving in different places. (left,right,backwards,etc)     </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I was able to use code on scratch to code my sprite so that it could move freely and even added another one.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I kept trying to use the more complicated code which I struggled in,slightly, to make my character do more advanced things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I did not ask for help or question as I have used scratch previously and understood the basics and how to use the code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked alone during this whole tasks and struggled ever so slightly as I listened to the tasks and advice the teacher gave us.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on the lesson for homework and looked back at the different</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was really engaged and tried to do more complicated things such as adding 2 building sprites from the library to make it look that my sprite was next to a skyscraper.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

    <td>I think that I should have focused better on when our second sprite was brought in and introduced as I struggled on trying to code the cat sprite when it touched the Blue Block sprite.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that I should focus on more of the different things that I don't understand or understand more less than other significant or mildly important things, this would improve my scratch game and help me to understand more of the other complicated things that would improve my other future games.</td>
