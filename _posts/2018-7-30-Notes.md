- The Tulku system is problematic in many ways. One way to point it out is to observe very objectively how all the Lama incarnate are... men. What a coincidence.

- Reading Jack Kornfield's _After the Ecstasy, the Laundry_, a collection of accounts from meditators telling their experiences. I wonder if we should hear those accounts with a grain of salt. We know how to write pretty words about our experiences. I could see myself producing a deep and flowery account of my moments in meditation that could read as extraordinary, when all of it was just really ordinary. Who knows?
