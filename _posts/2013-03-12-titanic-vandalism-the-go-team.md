# Titanic Vandalism — The Go! Team

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDMGXZL6-f8 I've written before on the idea of genre mixing — a relatively modern idea — and _The Go! Team_ is a wonderful example of that. It's garage rock full of sampling, but there are chants, hip-hop, soundtracks, classical, guitar rock, even Bollywood. In short, every track is a [high-energy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lT2Tq2rC9I) theme song to some terrible 1980s action movie, and it's _fun_. Moreover, the production is lo-fi — so lo-fi that it's often impossible to tell what's been performed by one of the band's three drummers and what's been sampled from an old movie. So is the timbre a nostalgic homage to the 70s, or an actual copy from it? Is sampling a form of homage? I know lots of these tracks contain samples, but at a certain point it doesn't matter, and I think _The Go! Team_ reaches that point. Finding out now that one of the riffs was a [sample](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=KZko7K8gtlE) wouldn't be elucidating, it would be frustrating. Even if it's sampled, it's still original.
