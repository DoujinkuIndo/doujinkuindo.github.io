Japan is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean with dense cities, imperial palaces, mountainous national 
parks and thousands of shrines and temples. 

Shinkansen bullet trains connect the main islands of Kyushu 
(with Okinawa's subtropical beaches), Honshu (home to Tokyo and Hiroshimaâ€™s atomic-bomb memorial) and 
Hokkaido (famous for skiing). Tokyo, the capital, is known for skyscrapers, shopping and pop culture.
