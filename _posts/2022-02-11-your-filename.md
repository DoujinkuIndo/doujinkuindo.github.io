## Starting a SaaS business when youâ€™ve never met your cofounder

The most fundamental core of any business relationship is trust. Traditionally this was built through multiple interactions, which included at least in-person meeting.

It seemed that something about meeting in person helped solidify what was discussed. Whether this is through body language or both parties being able to lower their guards and speak somewhat informally.

These in-person meetings have been a staple for long-lasting business relationships. However, the ability for these type of interactions has been put on hold thanks to the current pandemic. The startup community has had to adapt to these restrictions and in my opinion, the perfect environment for entrepreneurship was created.

People with extra time on their hands and nothing to do.

While I recognize and have experienced the downsides of this pandemic from a business perspective, I try to look at the positives. This motivation is what led to my most recent startup, Accordably, which is a competitor monitoring solution.
