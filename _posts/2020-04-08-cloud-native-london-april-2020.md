As always, we are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com), [D2iQ](https://d2iq.com) and [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), for your ongoing support and sponsorship.

### Overview

First up, Dewald Viljoen from RVU told us about [The SRE journey at RVU: People, automation and data-driven decisions](https://youtu.be/4ZSqjoFzxHI?t=1808). He shared his [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/dewaldv/the-sre-journey-at-rvu) and takeaways:

* Data-driven conversations and visibility are the key ingredients in winning over teams and ultimately operating systems more reliably.
* Rolling out SRE practices is difficult, find ways to make this simpler for all involved to adopt.
* Automation is for everyone and should reach far beyond just deployments and infrastructure.

Next, Amir Avraham from Alcide presented [SSL Certificates in multi cluster environments](https://youtu.be/4ZSqjoFzxHI?t=3722)). He concluded that:

* No need to pay for certificates anymore use Let's Encrypt.
* Wildcard certificates can be used globally on each k8s cluster for different purposes, just keep them secure on a private bucket/blob.
* Use Alcide Advisor to scan your k8s cluster for threats, misconfiguration and keep high level of hygiene

Finally,  Andrei Cioaca from Capgemini wrapped up our evening by discussing [Next Generation Platform Architecture](https://youtu.be/4ZSqjoFzxHI?t=6275). He summed it up that:

* Finding the right architecture in multi-cloud ecosystem to design efficient platforms.
* Compromise that you might need to make when designing a new platform.
* How to blend open-source with vendor technologies for the greater good.
