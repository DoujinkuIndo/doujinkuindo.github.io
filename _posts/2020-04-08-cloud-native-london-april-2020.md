As always, we are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com), [D2iQ](https://d2iq.com) and [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), for your ongoing support and sponsorship.


First up, Dewald Viljoen from RVU told us about The SRE journey at RVU: People, automation and data-driven decisions (starting at [30:08](https://youtu.be/4ZSqjoFzxHI?t=1808)). His takeaways are that:

* Data-driven conversations and visibility are the key ingredients in winning over teams and ultimately operating systems more reliably.
* Rolling out SRE practices is difficult, find ways to make this simpler for all involved to adopt.
* Automation is for everyone and should reach far beyond just deployments and infrastructure.

Next up, Amir Avraham from Alcide told us about SSL Certificates in multi cluster environments (starting at [1:02:02](https://youtu.be/4ZSqjoFzxHI?t=3722)). He concluded that: 

* No need to pay for certificates anymore use Let's Encrypt.
* Wildcard certificates can be used globally on each k8s cluster for different purposes, just keep them secure on a private bucket/blob.
* Use Alcide Advisor to scan your k8s cluster for threats, misconfiguration and keep high level of hygiene 

Finally,  Andrei Cioaca from Capgemini wrapped up our evening by discussing Next Generation Platform Architecture (starting [1:44:35](https://youtu.be/4ZSqjoFzxHI?t=6275)). He summed it up by discussing these points:

* Finding the right architecture in multi-cloud ecosystem to design efficient platforms.
* Compromise that you might need to make when designing a new platform.
* How to blend open-source with vendor technologies for the greater good.
