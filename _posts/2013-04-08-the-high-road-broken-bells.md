# The High Road — Broken Bells

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkr19RSG6k Another group it took me ages to really pick up on, notice, familiarize myself with. It's so hard to keep up with everything modern; all books, television, movies, music; we're expected to have opinions on things which we haven't yet seen, can't've yet seen, and we're judged by them; by how well we keep up. We know all about a famous movie, have a pre-formed opinion, before we ever see it. Broken Bells is this way — I know the singer from _The Shins_; I know the producer, _Danger Mouse._ I knew about the album, I was familiar with the art and some of the tracks, even the general tone of the album, without ever having really heard it. But the intro is still — damn, that intro.
