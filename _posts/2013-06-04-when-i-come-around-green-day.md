# When I Come Around — Green Day

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmJxtgmsqAE I came into this review expecting to talk about punk and how its incredible, lush, warm sound outweighs the detriments of its shit attitude and prepubescent virtues — but the video took me aback. I can extrapolate here — when they have a video for a song, it's typically about what the song is about, and the song and video are about gazing — observing, passively, another human being at some slice in their life. It's about navelgazing, introspection, the passivity and loneliness of isolation; it's about shoegazing, and depression, but it's also about windowgazing and escapism, the ability to look out at someone else and, for a moment, if not become them, at least pretend. The angry young men of the punk world, who could commission a video that tears apart the whole system, man — it's easy to reject this as extreme, ridiculous, immature. But, our system is not perfect, and their criticisms are often valid. We create walls and buildings and taboos for ourselves, and only some of us can cross them. We have entire generations of lonely people in a packed, crowded world.
