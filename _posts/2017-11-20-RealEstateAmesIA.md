title: Real Estate AmesIA
---
This is a study trying to predict the price of the real Estate in Ames IA (regression model) and the type of transaction that takes place normal or Abnormal (classification model). As a human being, you must admit that at some point in your life you thought you knew about something more than you actually did. Don't be ashamed because, amongst other things, we walk  around this world carrying a backpack full of assumptions. They are useful most of the times... but not always. So, let's try to take some weight off this bag and figure out what are these things that really matter when establishing the price in the real estate. Ready to find out?
