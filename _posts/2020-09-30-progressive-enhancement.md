**Sample Code and Activities**: [Progressive Enhancement Examples]({{site.baseurl}}/sample-code/frontend/progressive-enhancement/)

## 2. Feature Detection
Objective: To understand what the concept of feature detection is, and be able to implement suitable solutions in CSS.

This will be a live code session with Progressive Enhancement Example 4, above.

## Activity: The future, future, future...
1. Find a new(ish) CSS property (not covered in class today) that interests you.
2. Investigate its current browser support.
3. Create a demo of this property.
4. Using what you've learned about CSS overrides and feature detection, can you refactor this project to be at least useable in non-supported browsers?
