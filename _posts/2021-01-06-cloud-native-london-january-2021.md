Joining us to welcome 2021 at the January Cloud Native London virtual meetup via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams were three great speakers from Sainsburys, Hazelcast, and Exelerys. 

We are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/) and [Humio](https://humio.com/) for your enthusiastic and generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Long term friend of Cloud Native London, Simon Perry from Sainsburys kicked off our first talk for the evening by exploring Cloud Native at a 150 year old Retail Institution - the good the bad and the ugly (starting at [30:01](https://youtu.be/ntXwpBF1NME?t=1801)). His takeaways are:

* Concentrate on what differentiates your business
* Don't be afraid to take educated risks
* Invest in learning and self-development

Next up was Rafał Leszko from Hazelcast discussing Architectural Caching Patterns for Kubernetes (starting at [1:00:08](https://youtu.be/ntXwpBF1NME?t=3608)). He talked about:

* A walk-through of all caching topologies you can use in Kubernetes
* Pros and Cons of using each caching topology
* The future of caching in container-based environments

Finally, after a break Jesus Escolar from Exelerys talked about Securing DevOps CI/CD Pipelines in the Cloud – 2021 Update (starting at [1:47:27](https://youtu.be/ntXwpBF1NME?t=6447)). His takeaways mentioned that:

* CyberSecurity for DevOps is in an unharmonized state. Define your business needs, use the best fit for security tools.
* DevSecOps is critical when adopting cloud-based DevOps. Integrate security properly.
* The legacy security issues are now native for DevOps. Dust old security books. Apply #ZeroTrust !!!
