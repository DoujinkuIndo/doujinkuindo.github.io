CATNIP Lab is looking for awesome people: postdocs, graduate & undergraduate students interested in computational neuroscience and machine learning.

For further information please contact [I. Memming Park](mailto:memming.park@stonybrook.edu).

## Postdocs

A full-time postdoctoral position is available in the Computational And Theoretical Neural Information Processing lab at Stony Brook University. Current projects include inferring the latent dynamics of a neural population in awake behaving monkeys using recorded spikes and local field potential, and building scalable statistical models for high-dimensional neural observations. Our lab provides a friendly and highly collaborative environment.

### Requirements
Candidate must have a PhD or equivalent in neuroscience, statistics, engineering, mathematics or a related field. Ideal candidate would be familiar with machine learning and/or neural modeling. Prior experience in analyzing neural data, high-dimensional data, and/or non-Gaussian time series is a plus but not required. Good numerical programming skills and experience with professional software development are expected.

## Graduate students

### Computational neuroscience
Strong background in mathematics, statistics, physics, computer sceince, or electrical/biomedical engineering is highly encouraged.

There are several neural data analysis projects as well as pure machine learning projects.

### Experimental neuroscience
Neurobiology students who are working with complex high-dimensional data are welcome to bring their data. We specialize in spike train analysis, but other time series modalities are also welcome.

## Undergraduate students
Undergraduate students who are interested in analyzing and visualizing neural data are welcome to inquire.

Prior experience on numerical computing (MATLAB, python (numpy/theano), julia, R) is strongly encouraged.
