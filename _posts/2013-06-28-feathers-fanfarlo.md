# Feathers — Fanfarlo

> It is the singer in the river is the siren on the rock Before the time you wake up feeling nothing at all (1:03)

Here, in praise of specific moments and timbres — the inventive rhythms, offbeats and counterweights and free-wheeling gears and pulleys, caribbean drums and slippery bass, vibrating choral instruments and strings for highlights, brilliant and expressive and fresh, fun, incredible music — and there is a point, a point I can directly select and say, listen, this is great. I don't know who did this, but this is great. And I think that property of a song, to have a particular best moment, like a stunt or a line of dialogue in a movie; that's incredible.
