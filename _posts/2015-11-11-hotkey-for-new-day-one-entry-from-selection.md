I use Day One to journal. There is a service that creates a new Day One entry from the selection, but it didn't have a hotkey associated with it. So I've set one up.

First (optional) step is to use to [make your CAPS LOCK key useful](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/). Big thanks to Brett Terpstra for that, I use that for loads of other shortcuts.

Next step is to add a shortcut for the **New Day One Entry With Selection**
 using the [instructions to create keyboard shortcuts in the Apple knowledge base](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH13916?locale=en_US).

I used **CAPSLOCK D** as the hotkey to send whatever I've got currently selected to Day One as a new entry, works a treat.

Note: this is **^⇧⌥⌘ D** using the optional first step, so it is the same as pressing Control, Shift, Option, Command, D all at the same time.
