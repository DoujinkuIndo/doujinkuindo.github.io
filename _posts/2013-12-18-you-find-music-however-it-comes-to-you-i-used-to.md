You find music however it comes to you. I used to trade flash drive, 4 or 8Gb at a time, through the mail, through a network of camp friends spanning the entire East coast. Then I would trawl public libraries for records, or my dad's CD libraries. Then torrenting, then YouTube. HypeMachine for a while, SoundCloud, even Spotify.
This is from a podcast, Welcome to Night Vale, a surrealist horror series with interstitial songs by underground artists. Linked above is Closer by The Tiny; below are Jerusalem by Dan Bern and Despite What You've Been Told by Two Gallants. Have a listen.

I don't know what qualities the creators look for in selecting music, but I get the fucking chills from each and every one of these songs. The podcast walks the line between funny-creepy and creepy-funny, but these songs are positively creepy, exhibiting a sort of quasi-reverence and emotional rawness which I find in very short supply.

Freshman Econ teaches us that people act in their best self-interest, with the qualifiers 'always', 'on average', 'usually', and/or 'sometimes'. Why do we listen to the music we do? It must help us in some way. It pumps us up, or powers us down; reveals things we didn't know, or distracts us from things we don't want to. There is no useless music.

These are formless, ethereal songs. I have no doubt that everyone sees them differently.
