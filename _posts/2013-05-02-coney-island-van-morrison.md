# Coney Island — Van Morrison

> And all the time going to Coney Island, I'm thinking, Wouldn't it be great if it was like this all the time?

Summer is coming and I'm growing up by the seat of my pants — in a few weeks I'll have a paying job, an apartment on campus, a roommate; I'll have to pay bills and buy groceries, ration money and figure out what to do with my free time. It's not hard, everybody does it. Still, it feels real and important and exciting, moving house and figuring things out.

Plus, the feelings of summer — peace and sun and warmth, intrinsic natural human responses — and plenty of time for my work, my research, my hobbies. This is what I want it to feel like.
