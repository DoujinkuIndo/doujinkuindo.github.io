# Boston — Augustana

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ASJBXu8tNo It's always distressing when a pop song is _good_. We want pop to be shitty, because it's easy to explain — this is a simple, four-chord pop song, with a produced instrumental featuring piano, maybe a buzzy 90s guitar, a guy with long hair singing about lost love or something; there's a riff, we all know the chorus but none of us know the verse. But this is an exception — it's all of these things, it's anthemic and cathartic and all the other ics, but it's _good_. I don't have any particular explanation. The lyrics are less vapid than I'd expect; the arrangement is tasteful and not overwhelming; the emotional content is vivid without being preachy. It just works. Comparatively, this is a triumph.
