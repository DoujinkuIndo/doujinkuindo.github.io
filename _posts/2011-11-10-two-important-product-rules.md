Steven Poole has a great post up. In it he states two 'rules'. He may not be the first to verbalise them, but he's got a great commentary on them.
[Go take a read](http://stevenpoole.net/blog/whatever-made-you-think-it-was-your-data-anyway/).

For that that are still reading here and not over there, here are the two rules:

- If you’re not paying for something, you’re not a customer; you’re the product being sold.
- If you’re not paying for something, you have no reason to expect it to be there tomorrow.

You'll need to go [here to read it](http://stevenpoole.net/blog/whatever-made-you-think-it-was-your-data-anyway/) - it'll make you sit up and think about the 'free' services you're using on the internet.
