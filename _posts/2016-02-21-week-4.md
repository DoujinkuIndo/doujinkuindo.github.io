<h3>Week :four: </h3>
***  
__:question: Questions :question:__  
*1. What did you do this past week?*  
    This past week my partner and I finished up and turned in Project 2. We've also been learning about lists,
    tuples, and generators in python.
    
*2. What's in your way?*  
    Just preparing for the first exam.
    
*3. What will you do next week?*  
    I'll be studying for the upcoming exam. This includes doing the readings, doing well on the quizzes, and attending
    class.
***  
  I've been doing better on the quizzes which I'm pretty happy about. I've been making sure I pay attention to little details like, is it a List or a Tuple? Dictionary or a Set?
  
  I've enjoyed the class lectures and the interactive learning style Downing has. He shows lots of different examples so we can see the functionality within python. One day, maybe, our class will get excited at the high point of the lecture!

  I think what's going on with the San Bernardino Case is really important in terms of setting precedent for our privacy and if you haven't read the letter Tim Cook wrote, go check it out: [!Customer Letter](http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/)
