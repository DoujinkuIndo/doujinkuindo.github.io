title: Clubs and Societies I Could Join
---
Joining a club or society, while not mandatory, greatly improves the university experience and expands a student's network. At Anglia Ruskin University, there's <a href="https://www.angliastudent.com/societies/join/">a plethora to choose from</a>. 

Based on my personal interests, I've considered joining the following societies:

<ul>
  <li>Anime and Manga Society</li>
  <li>Cue.5 - Theatre Society</li>
  <li>Film Viewing Society</li>
  <li>Order of the Ruskin</li>
  <li>LGBT+ Society</li>
  <li>Philosophy Society</li>
  <li>Tabletop and Gaming Society</li>
</ul>

One of them, the Tabletop and Gaming Society, could provide me with a network that may prove beneficial to my course. While the others are less likely to do that, they could still provide me with inspiration.
    
EDIT: I am now a proud member of all the societies listed above.
