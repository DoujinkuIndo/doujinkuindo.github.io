# This Bitter Earth — Dinah Washington / Max Richter

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXHGoaEtmFM A professional mashup by [Robbie Robertson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Robertson) (of _The Band_) of Max Richter's [On the Nature of Daylight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVN1B-tUpgs) and Clyde Otis' [This Bitter Earth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmEhO1OiEkY) as performed by Dinah Washington, produced as part of the soundtrack for Martin Scorsese's _Shutter Island_, and played over the closing credits. A complex, melancholy, and very beautiful song, I think. Dinah Washington was a '50s and '60s American blues singer, best known for [What a Difference a Day Makes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmBxVfQTuvI). Max Richter is a modern British classical musician, nearly ambient in his style. Rarely have I heard a more devastating piece of music — let alone a mash-up. Washington's original, done as a blues single with schmaltzy backing strings, evokes sadness, certainly, but in a cinematic way, a temporary cliffhanger, designed for suspense and drama. But somehow Richter's replacement strings add a finality to the song, I think — studied in the context of the film, _Shutter Island_, (especially as a commentary on its ending), it delivers not a temptation for melancholy, but a definitive statement — this is the way life is. It's engrossing and repulsive in its sadness, but it's such a completely immersive sound.
