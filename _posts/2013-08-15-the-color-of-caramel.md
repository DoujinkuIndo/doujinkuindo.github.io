# The Color of Caramel

There was no sleep to be had, the night before. Six hours to go. My room is empty, my bed is stripped, I’m staring into space. Run the checklist, run it again. Trust in the infallibility of the checklist for a moment, just as a joke. Compose an essay titled 20 Common Mistakes People Make When Moving Out, but Buzzfeed won’t buy it.

Still six hours to go. Maybe more. Fuck it.

We get in the car, go for a joyride again. It’s been an unkind parody of rain, today. Visibility is low, and my mind fills in the distance. We get to a county road, work our way up to 40, and then book it. 1.2 Gs, I like to imagine. Probably far less. Get up to speed, 90, 100, 130, max out at 150. The corn is a blur, again.

Get Steak ‘n’ Shake. A final time, a mirror of all the other times. I recognize some of the waitresses.

Get back. Three hours to go. Still can’t sleep. Probably won’t, at this point.

It’s time. Pack, move, go. 5:30 am, in the car, can’t see more than twenty feet. Everything is silent.

The train station is the emptiest I’ve ever seen it. I get on the train, window seat, begin to tune out. The sun is barely risen.

As the tendrils reach through the fog, they color the air itself — the landscape, the interplay of color and light, texture and depth, is volumetric. An infinity of points between me and the sun, and each dampens it a little bit, diffusing it and reflecting it and creating a halo around the sun. It lights up the trees in the fields from behind, tracing their outlines in shadows splayed out, written on the sky. The west horizon is dark.

We pass a small town. It swims past, as if underwater. All is bright white and yellow, the color of caramel.
