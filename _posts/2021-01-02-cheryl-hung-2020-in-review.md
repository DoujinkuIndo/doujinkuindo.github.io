Last January, my husband [Nick](http://harveynick.com/) innocently remarked that since I spent 134 days away from home in 2019, it would be nice for us to spend a bit more time together at home...

As it turns out, it only took a global pandemic to have 24/7 time together for the last nine months...! ðŸ˜†

__Professionally I had an exceptional year.__ My highlights include:
* [A promotion to Vice President](/2020/07/16/promotion-to-vp-plus-im-hiring/)
* [Joining Helio as an advisor](/2020/05/05/i-am-joining-helio-as-an-advisor/)
* [Launching the CNCF End User Tech Radar](/2020/06/12/introducing-the-cncf-technology-radar/)
* [Hiring CNCF's first Ecosystem Advocate](/2020/11/04/cncf-welcomes-katie-gamanji-as-ecosystem-advocate/)
* [Winning the individual #TechWomen100 award](/2020/11/16/cheryl-hung-wins-the-techwomen100-award-2020/)

My favourite talk was my [keynote at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America](2020/11/17/kubecon-cloudnativecon-na-2020-keynote-are-certifications-worth-it/):

__It's been a difficult year personally.__ I lost my [grandfather and uncle to Covid-19](/2020/04/01/my-grandfather-has-passed-away-due-to-covid-19/) in April, and [my former boss Dan](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/in-memoriam-dan-kohn/) in November. I burned out painfully in September and again in November due to stress.

__However, I have much to be grateful for.__ I started playing music again after 14 years. I've built a Mandarin Chinese study habit and have kept it up for 255+ days. I've reconnected with old friends and family in Hong Kong. I [moved the Cloud Native London meetup online](/2020/03/17/cloud-native-london-going-virtual-and-thoughts-on-running-a-large-meetup/) and am forever grateful to my speakers, sponsors and loyal community who make it possible to keep going and even expand into [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cloudnativelon) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQxZcD4SJRukX5Ae4ZZjL8A) livestreams:

__Above all I remain optimistic.__ I don't know what life will look like in five years. But I've been blessed to receive many opportunities, and be able to give opportunities to others and watch them grow. I truly cherish the many friends who have taught me so much, so thank you all for sticking by my side through this extraordinary year.

With much love,

Cheryl
