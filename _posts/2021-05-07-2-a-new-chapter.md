Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock**, my blog that will be cataloguing my experiences during my gap year, which officially started on May 1st. My goal is to post every 2-3 weeks on Fridays, depending on how much is going on in my life.

If you haven’t read [my first blog introducing the website](https://www.warunlock.com/1-hello-world/), please do so! It introduces the background of the blog, some details around the tech stack, and the outline of blog content.

### What I’ve been up to
In truth, between my last blog post to now has been fairly boring, in terms of writing content.

In the first week and some change, I’ve spent time making sure my insurance and financial accounts were all settled, and finalized my budget for the year. I also had my round of chatting with my social circle about my gap year, making sure I stayed connected with folks while the pandemic restrictions were still in effect. Finally, I’ve gotten my blog up and running!

After getting most of those loose ends tied, I spent a couple of days... chilling out and not doing much. No broken software to fix, no project deadlines to meet, and no Zoom meetings to attend. My brain buzzed on what would be the next thing to do on my list, so it took some time to rewire my brain to the space.

After some chill time, I’ve been slowly figuring out what my weekly schedule would look like. Besides my weekly volunteering shift on Monday mornings, I had no other structured obligations. I can take advantage of doing various shenanigans during the weekday and largely avoid the crowds during the weekend. What exactly I have planned is still an ongoing process.

With the nice spring weather and my vaccinations done, I’ve started jogging again after over a year. I found [a 10K training schedule](https://www.verywellfit.com/beginner-runners-10k-training-schedule-2911611) to reorient myself to a goal that will get me outside. This helped me think around "rest" days and structuring my week. I’ve never run faster than a 9:30-minute mile, but it’s always my goal to try a triathlon!

### What I’ve learned
One way I’ve been keeping myself occupied during the pandemic was to take random online courses. While it didn’t help me get off the computer, I’ve learned some really cool things along the way.

As part of the gap year, I’ve also been going through [an online scuba diving course](https://www.padi.com/courses/open-water-diver) in the hopes of being able to scuba dive in the next year. (I was fortunate enough to try a trial version in Australia and it was an amazing experience!) I’ve coincidentally been taking [an online chemistry course](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-chemistry) at the same time. The overlap between the two courses was [the application of the gas laws ](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/States_of_Matter/Properties_of_Gases/Gas_Laws/Gas_Laws%3A_Overview) on the human body.

One of the aspects of scuba diving that the online course repeated over and over again - ascend slowly, and never hold your breath underwater. The beginning of the course stressed these points to ensure that they form into habits. Breathing also ensures that the diver has the oxygen to think clearly and rationally, and they are not drowning.

What actually happens to the body underwater? In short, diving underwater puts pressure on the human body. Descending underwater will increase the pressure on the body, while ascending underwater will decrease the pressure on the body. Gases are particularly affected by pressure. [Increasing pressure compresses the gases, while decreasing pressure expands the gases.](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/introchem/chapter/boyles-law-volume-and-pressure/)

Two injuries that can occur due to rapid ascent and/or holding your breath are lung overexpansion and decompression sickness.
* Lung overexpansion is pretty self-explanatory. (Think about a balloon that has too much air filled in. Or on second thought, don’t think about it.)
* Decompression sickness is a serious but very preventable condition that happens if you ascend too rapidly underwater. When underwater, the diver breathes in compressed air, which is [composed of 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas#For_diving_and_other_hyperbaric_use). The nitrogen gas is not used in the body, but is instead dissolved in the body's tissues. When the diver ascends slowly underwater, the nitrogen gas slowly exits the body through the lungs. If the diver ascends too quickly, the nitrogen starts to expand into gas bubbles within the body, which can severely damage the body. (Think about [opening a soda bottle and how the carbon dioxide bubbles form as a result](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink#Carbonated_drinks). Again, maybe don’t think about it.) Getting rid of all the excess nitrogen does take time; this condition can also occur when you fly on a plane shortly after diving.

Yes, this learning tidbit is a bit grim. However, knowing the risks and procedures to minimize those risks are well worth the experience of diving underwater!

[The overlap of information also helped me retain information on both courses.](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymaker-psychology/chapter/ways-to-enhance-memory/) The gas law theory is readily applied to the scuba diving class. The procedures that scuba divers do to avoid injury can be explained by how gas pressures affect the diver’s body.

### What I’ve seen

Last Friday, I wanted to take advantage of the weather and explore a few places while there were relatively few people around. I visited Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, perused a few shops (both familiar and new), bought a few pastries, and sat at a picnic table in McCarren Park (shown above) to munch on said pastries.

### A chapter closed
Thank you for reading this blog post! I hope you found joy in the things I’ve learned so far, and will come back for more!

After some noodling around Bluehost and some personal debating, I’ve set up the contact email [susanna@warunlock.com](mailto:susanna@warunlock.com), which is available as part of the set of links at the bottom of the website.

In addition, I’ve added an email subscription list if you prefer to get blog updates through email rather than LinkedIn. Simply visit [the Subscribe page in War(un)lock](https://www.warunlock.com/subscribe/) to get started.

Please stay safe, and take care!
