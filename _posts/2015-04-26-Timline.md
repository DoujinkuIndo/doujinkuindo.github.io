# Snapshot Timeline
By Ranjith Tellis and Shiemi Lim

### Objective

1. New Visualization
2. Implement using widely used technology
3. Meaningful to our field of work Adverting, Healthcare

 

### Ground work:

1. Visualizing events over a period of time
2. Scouted how certain timelines are visualized

    * Facebook timeline

    * Twitter timeline

    * Patient Data

3. How to visualize events such as these
    * Advertisement strategy
    * Patient clinical data

4. Generalize visualization to any events over a period of time.

### Mockup:

### Demo:

1.       Full timeline of Patient data.
![Sketch](https://github.com/Shemster/shemster.github.io/blob/master/images/TimelineScreenshot.png "Logo Title Text 1")
2.       Explanation of Patient data set.
3.       Highlight different events.
4.       Modify some data to demonstrate data is retrieved dynamically.
Change isStandAlone = false to true. 
```sh
var isStandAlone = true;
        timelineData = "Data.csv";
```    
Or edit manually in the data set:
```sh
    if (isStandAlone) {
            allEvents = [{ Date: "6/5/2009", Description: "Description comes here", EndDate: "", EventLocationType: "bottom", HeaderText: "Bottom event", Result: "+ve" },
            { Date: "11/15/2010", Description: "Description comes here", EndDate: "", EventLocationType: "flag", HeaderText: "Flag event", Result: "-ve" },
            ];
            draw();
``` 
5.       Change data source to advertising data to demonstrate its data agnostic.
 
 



### Key features:

1.       Framework to visualize timeline data.
2.       Developed using Html5, JavaScript & D3 library.
3.       Data abstracted from visualization code.

 

### Technical concepts:

1.       Create timeline axis.
2.       Map events to timeline and vice-versa.
3.       Create shapes in SVG

 
### Technical Challenges:

1.       Zoom: Add a background rectangle.
2.       Removing existing elements.


### Future enhancements:

1.       Visualize events further apart in single view port.
2.       Visualize related events.
3.       Fix nitty-gritty issues overlapping events, text overflow, aesthetics.


### Summary

Software development life cycle:

1.       Agile development.
    *       Created sprint/backlog.
2.       Pair programming.
