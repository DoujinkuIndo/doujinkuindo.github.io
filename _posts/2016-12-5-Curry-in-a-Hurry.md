title: Curry in a Hurry!

It is a cold evening here in Marin County, where I am currently living. San Rafael, CA to be exact. I have been studying JavaScript, and am feeling pretty good about my progress.

Because I felt stuck at FreeCodeCamp, I started taking courses on udemy.com. I have completed one JavaScript course there, and now I am doing another one. I have also gone to another bootcamp meetup in SF at a school called Rithm School. At this meetup I was directed to the website of Rithm School, which has some really good free courses, including JavaScript which I started studying from. In addition to that I also found a great resource for learning Javascript called Practical Javascript.

I hope to use these concurrently to make sure my fundamentals are absolutely solid before I embark on the algorithm challenges on FCC, becuase I know once I start those I will be searching google a lot. Tonight I have delayed my eating because I came home from work and began to study immediately. I am about to run to the store and pick up a few vegetables to throw together with a premade curry sauce. You could call it, curry in a hurry!
