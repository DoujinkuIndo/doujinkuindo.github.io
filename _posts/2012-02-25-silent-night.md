# Silent Night: A Play About Family, Religion, And The Importance Of Occasional Dishonesty

This is the final draft of the play I wrote in senior year of high school for Brick, the playwriting festival at Hunter. Although it didn't win, it was still something I challenged myself to do, and did, although admittedly very, very quickly. Months later, it's still semi-coherent.

# **Silent Night**

## _by James Buckland_

## **Character List**

Dr. Gertrude Stein a neurotic, seedy little Jewish doctor. Never fully aware of his surroundings, but competent enough, despite his apparent shortcomings. Not the social climber he hopes to be.

Joseph of Nazareth a hardworking Jewish carpenter, often oblivious and quick to anger. Kind but not terribly smart. Cares for his wife and family. Adorable and sometimes shy.

Mary of Nazareth Joseph’s wife. Loving and sweet, with a focus on keeping her family together. A traditional Jewish mother with a secret. Doesn’t live up to the high moral standard we set for her.

Jebediah of Nazareth Joseph’s sleazy, arrogant brother. A bit of a showoff. More Buscemi than Clooney. Sadly oblivious to himself, but ultimately a redeemable character.

Balthazar Simpson an advertising agent from Jerusalem. Fast-talking, clever, and determined. Often dramatic to the point of... absurdity. Groucho Marx without the cruel streak. Maybe a fez?

Caspano Voltissimo an Italian circus ringleader. Wildly emotional but passionate about his work. Fluctuates between deadpan and very-much-alive–pan. Wildly dressed. Moves his hands a lot.

Illinois Smith a world-famous adventurer/explorer, here on a mission. Confident, charming, and brave. Thick Texan accent. Good with the ladies. Like a religious Indiana Jones.

NB: Although Mary, Joseph, Jebediah, and Dr. Stein are all gender-locked, Balthazar, Illinois and Caspano are all relatively fluid. Can be played by/as men, women, or women dressed as men, if appropriate.

## **Setting**

The famous stable from the biblical Nativity story. Evening. The biblical stable, replete with manger and haystacks. Solid walls optional. Should be instantly recognizable.

Lights up on the Nativity. Mary and Joseph in the traditional manner, cooing over the newborn baby Jesus in his manger; the scene is picturesque until Dr. Stein rises up from behind a bale of hay.

DR STEIN So, as I was saying, I’ve really got to run. I’ve got a date down at the Olympus diner with this very nice Jewish girl I met at the hospital, and I’ve absolutely got to change these clothes! Wouldn’t want to make a bad first impression on a potential customer. Lovely girl.

JOSEPH Oh, Mary, just look at our son! You can just tell he’s going to be a great leader one day.

MARY His little perfect hands and feet.

JOSEPH The way his mouth flaps open and closed.

MARY His little tummy.

JOSEPH Strong jawline, no widow’s peak.

MARY His little ears!

JOSEPH And no unseemly blemishes like his mothe– mouth! His mouth is so cute! Yes, this is the child for us. (to DR STEIN) We’ll take it!

DR STEIN I’m so glad to hear you say that! Because I can’t put him back. Don’t ask. I won’t do it.

MARY You did a wonderful job, Doctor.

DR STEIN As a matter of fact, I knew a doctor that once happened to. Dr. Levy! One moment he was telling the baby all about circumcision, and the next moment the little tyke broke free of his grasp and crawled right back into his mother! Had to deliver him all over again!

JOSEPH Ha! That must have driven up his insurance.

DR STEIN Insurance... my god, the paperwork! My paperwork! Joseph, if you couldn’t be a dear and run back to my office, fetch my files? They should be right there on the desk.

JOSEPH Of course, Doctor.

EXIT Joseph.

DR STEIN So, Mary. Immaculate conception, huh?

MARY Oh, thank you for playing along, Doctor. I do feel terrible about the lies, but it would have broken his heart.

DR STEIN So who is the father?

Suddenly, in bursts JEBEDIAH.

JEBEDIAH Where’s my baby boy?

MARY (to DR STEIN) This shmuck.

DR STEIN Him?

JEBEDIAH Mary! Doll! Looking fantastic as always. Have you lost weight?

MARY scowls.

JEBEDIAH Hey, my brother’s not around, is he?

DR STEIN (to JEB) Oh, so you’re the father? And Joseph doesn’t know?

JEBEDIAH Ha! You still haven’t told him!

DR STEIN Ah, from– (points to God above) Nu?

MARY Poor shmendrik thinks I’m still a Virgin.

JEBEDIAH I almost feel bad for the guy.

DR STEIN (ignoring Jeb) No! He hasn’t been telling people that, has he?

MARY I’m afraid he has.

DR STEIN You better watch out, people are gonna start calling you the Virgin Mary or something like that.

JEBEDIAH How did you convince him of that anyway, doll?

MARY I had to tell your brother something! The first time I had morning sickness, the window was open, and I just... improvised!

DR STEIN Oh, that poor boy.

JEBEDIAH You know, I’d believe it too, doll. If only such a beautiful woman would lie to me.

MARY Oh! Jebediah, you scoundrel!

DR STEIN So you two are together?

MARY What? No! Never!

JEBEDIAH Oh, Mary. You can’t hide your love from me.

MARY Get out of my stable!

JEBEDIAH Your stable? Is this the best Joseph can afford for you?

DR STEIN As stables go, not too shabby.

JEBEDIAH Oh, Mary, doll, we were meant to be together. Come back to me?

MARY I asked you to leave! Get out! Quickly! Before–

Suddenly, JOSEPH returns.

JOSEPH Brother! What are you doing here?

JEBEDIAH I was just visiting your lovely wife.

DR STEIN (smoothing over the issue as best he can) Wonderful, Joseph! Did you get the paperwork?

JOSEPH All right here.

DR STEIN Wonderful, wonderful. Let’s get to work.
