The Manjaro Community is proud to present our new Fluxbox Edition.

This aims to present a really fully featured release, complete with office- and multimedia-applications ready to use OOTB with a preconfigured menu for pretty much everything. The AwOken-iconset (coloured, white and dark) takes up some diskspace, too, but I think those icons are really beautifully designed and extraordinarily complete. Therefor the ISOs are not so small ( >1GB ) but anyway it remains a light and extremely fast system.

##New features and enhancements

* kernel 4.1
* Pamac
* Manjaro-Settings-Manager
* Pcmanfm
* Lxterminal
* Palemoon
* Claws-mail
* Hexchat
* Abiword, Mousepad, Nano
* Gnumeric, Galculator
* Pinta, Gpicview, Nitrogen, Qpdfview
* Pulseaudio, Lxmusic, VLC media-player
* Scrot
* Gparted
* manjaro-printer
* Wbar, Fluxbox-Menu
* Clipit, Cbatticon, nm-applet, pa-applet, Oblogout with OutMok-theme
* AwOken-icon-theme, new custom 'manjaro-flux'-theme, Compton
* yaourt, base-devel

As usual, this release comes with our advanced graphical installer **Thus** aswell as our **CLI-installer**.
Default kernel is **linux41**. **Stable** branch was used to create these install medias.

An OpenRC version of this edition will be available shortly.

Please give us feedback and report any issues with this release.

kind regards
Bernhard Landauer, Maintainer Manjaro-Fluxbox
