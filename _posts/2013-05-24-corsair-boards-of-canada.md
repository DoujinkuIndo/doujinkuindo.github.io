# Corsair — Boards of Canada

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=CZHS52l-4Nw This song unnerves me. I’m always amazed at how much emotion Boards of Canada can bring from lyric-devoid synth-scapes like this, but I’m doubly surprised at how I can get an entirely different sensation from this song than I do from, say, ([Kid for Today](http://www.jbuckland.com/blog/kid-for-today-boards-of-canada/)). I think it comes down to less apparent aspects of the music – the dynamics, the volume, the tone. There’s a constant swell-and-shrink to this track, coming off a smooth BoC-signature synthesizer, but something about the “peak” feels constricting, claustrophobic. Like a sunny day that’s just a little too bright, or a smile that’s just a little too wide – pleasing at first, but you shortly realize that something’s not right.
