Although there is a "Humannity" in the name of this class, it is different from most of the other humanity classes I've toke. We learned about ship names like tumblr, but the perpose of it is not to learn the meaning of the ship names nor to know where do these names come from. Instead, we are learning the way to find out these answer throwgh data analizing. The porpose of thes course is to learn how to analize literals as data. An other thing which suprised me is when visalize the poems, we are no trying to vosualoze the meaning of the poem but the characteristics of it, even for just word types. It is a tool to help us understand the lectures better instead of a conclution of the poems. This course will apply more coding than I imaged, and we even spent a lot of time on it through the class.
