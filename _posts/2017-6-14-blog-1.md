Hello and welcome to my blog! This is my first entry, I hope anyone reading this will enjoy it and continue following it.

My name is Jason Mattis. I am from Oregon and I have lived here my entire life. I am currently 29 years old. I am working for an IT Support department at a manufacturing company for about 2 years. I enjoy working here but I am always looking to expand my skillset and my knowledge within the tech field. I enjoy a good challenge which is why chose to teach myself to become a software engineer, focusing on Web Development.

I chose Web Development, mostly because it's an ever-evolving field. There are so many technologies which utilize various aspects of the web. I enjoy learning, and in Web Development seems to be the field I want to focus at this point in my career.

A little more background on me that pertains to computer science and software development. I do not have a college degree. I went to a community college here in Oregon, majoring in Computer Science. I didn’t finish due to my family running into financial difficulties. I love technologies and Computer Science intrigued me. This prompted me to try and get my degree in Computer Science. When I faced the decision to either continue my education or try and teach myself. I chose to teach myself. This way I could work and study. I tried taking classes around my work schedule, but working long hours conflicted with class scheduling. I then found out that there are free classes online to well-known Colleges such as Stanford. I had found Stanford’s intro to CS, which focused on Java. I finished this course and learned a lot, but I found myself not knowing what to do next. I would soon find out that I am not the only one. I decided I wanted to work in tech, but didn’t know where to begin. I thought that if I were to be a software engineer, I would need a CS degree. I thought the next best thing would be to try and build skills to get a job and Information Technology. The next best thing. I eventually got a job working in IT, which is where I am currently.

I have been looking around for free course to teach myself how to be a software engineer. There are a lot of resources and I found myself jumping from one to another. A few that I found and tried out were sites like codeacademy.com, freecodecamp.com, and a few course on Edx.org. All of the were great, and I did finish a couple on [Edx.org](http://edx.org), but none of them seem to prepare me for that next step. What do I do or where do I go one I complete the course? I’ve spent a lot of time on Reddit. Subscribing to [r/learntocode](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/), [r/WebDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/), [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) trying to gain more knowledge and find that next step. I eventually found a podcast called [Code Newbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/). I listen to this podcast on my way to work, lunch break, and on my way home. It is a great resource for new people coming into the world of software development and coding. [Soran](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek "Sorans Twitter"). She has many guests come on and
