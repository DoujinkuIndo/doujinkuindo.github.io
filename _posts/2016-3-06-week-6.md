<h3>Week :six: </h3>
***  
__:question: Questions :question:__  
*1. What did you do this past week?*  
    I reviewed past quizzes and studied the google doc for our exam we took on Thursday.
    
*2. What's in your way?*  
    Now, there's the third Project coming up. 
    
*3. What will you do next week?*  
    My group is meeting up Wednesday to decided what subject we want to use for our Project. We also have a guy from rackspace coming in and I'll probably want to take notes on it.

The exam wasn't too bad, but I think I could've done better on the coding portion. The short answer was pretty straightforward and easy for me.
I feel like the next exam I know what to study for the coding portion better and hopefully can improve in that section.

<h3> Major :key: </h3>  
I'm pretty sure someone has posted about this before, but there's a chrome extension called [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en). The one thing I don't like is that it doesn't transfer across all your computers. 
So, if you make a to-do list on your desktop and then log onto your laptop, the list won't show up on your laptop.
It's got really pretty photos and also gives you the current weather of your location.
