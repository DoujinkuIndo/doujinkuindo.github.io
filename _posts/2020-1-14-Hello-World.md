This is the first post on my new blog. Iâ€™m just getting this new blog going, so stay tuned for more. Subscribe below to get notified when I post new updates.

The picture in the heading is a close-up of my backyard pond. We dug it and installed a few years back, and put about a dozen small fish. About a year later half of them were dead, but the rest survived the first winter and so far it has been 2 full seasons and they are still growing.
