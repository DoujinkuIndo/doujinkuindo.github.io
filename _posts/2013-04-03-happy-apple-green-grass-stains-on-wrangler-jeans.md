# Green Grass Stains on Wrangler Jeans — Happy Apple

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlZS8mNJ4PA There's this cohort of musicians out in the mid west near the twin cities who all work with each other in different configurations.  The Bad Plus is the the most well-known, but there are countless others: Gang Font, Buffalo Collision, The David King Trucking Company, Golden Valley IS NOW, Halloween, Alaska, CAR-LOVE.  And they're all different and awesome even if there are an overwhelming number of them.  It's like listening to the same musicians in different shades.  What if the Bad Plus was freer and a little (dare I say) jammier?  Listen to Buffalo Collision.  What if they were less acoustic and had that modern-electric feel to them?  Listen to Happy Apple.  What if you took the often complex Bad Style and boiled it down to the basics where players had to really be economical?  Listen to Golden Valley IS NOW. It's hip.
