title: New MacBook to Have Processor Options?
---
**UPDATE:** *This was posted yesterday, but it was accidentally deleted.*

A new MacBook was announced during Apple's "Spring Forward" event--along with the Apple Watch. The new MacBook comes in two different configurations. However, looking at their sales page, it may be possible to select different processors when pre-orders open up. Only time will tell.
