### Customizing the blog using Jekyll and testing its speed.

Setting the website up was relatively easy more so once I found out about the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project which I simply forked to create my version of the website.  

Now that I've got the site up and running the next step is customizing it. Jekyll takes my content written in Markdown and creates completely static HTML pages. I am already familiar with the _**Markdown**_ markup language so editing my blog posts will be an easy thing to do.  

Adding a picture is as easy...
![example image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ocV1u5R.jpg "portable TV from the '50s")  
Or.. 


```javascript
/*Demonstrating a piece of javascript code*/  
var message = "hello world";  
alret(message);
```

## Advantages of static pages

As you probably guessed, the most important advantage I have by running this site is _**simplicity**_. My Jekyll website is minimal and fast, making only 3 HTTP requests (including my profile picture) and no calls to any sort of database. Besides that, the design is simple and mobile-friendly.



## _later edit:_ Optimizing the website:

I have decided to further optimize the project and to do this, I first need to get a quick analysis of my website.  
Using [SiteBeam](http://sitebeam.net/) I can analyse my website and easily find and solve some of its minor problems.  

Running the test..
![Scan results]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/websiteTest.JPG "The result of my first, full website scan")  

As you can see from the results, besides failing to meet some W3C compliance standards, my website is ranking very high in terms of speed, mobile/tablet optimization, good use of analytics and some other less important factors.  

![website speed]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/responseTime.JPG "Output for the speed test")  

This is mainly due to the advantages Jekyll offers, making it my preferred choice for developing a quick and efficient website.

The biggest problem the website faces is its low social interest and user engagement. I hope I can solve this problem in time by continuing to add more blog entries or some tutorials/information about things that interest me.

## Cookies:cookie:
Although unrelated to optimization, I have decided to add a message notifying users of my use of cookies. European laws require that digital publishers give visitors to their sites and apps information about their use of cookies and other forms of local storage.

### All in all..

I feel satisfied with the end result and I will keep updating the blog as frequently as possible.
