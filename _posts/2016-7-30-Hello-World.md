## Customizing the blog

Now that I've got the site up and running the next step is customizing it. Jekyll takes my content written in Markdown and creates completly static HTML pages. I am already familliar with the _**Markdown**_ markup language so editing my blog posts will be an easy thing to do.  

Adding a picture is as easy...
![example image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ocV1u5R.jpg "portable TV from the '50s")  
Or.. 


```javascript
/*Demonstrating a piece of javascript code*/
var message = "hello world";
alret(message);
```

## Advantages of static pages

As you probably guessed, the most important advantage I have by running this site is _**simplicity**_. My jekyll website is minimal and fast, making only 3 HTTP requests (including my profile picture) and no calls to any sort of database. Besides that, the design is simple and mobile-friendly.

### All in all..

I feel satisfied with the end result and I will keep updating the blog as frequently as possible.
