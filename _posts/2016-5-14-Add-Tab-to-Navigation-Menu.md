I started to blog using Jekyll that hosted in GitHub. I immediately love Jekyll as soon as I created my first blog with it.
It is so simple yet provide pretty much most of the features I need for technical project blogging. But as I moved further I 
found that GitHub disable plugin when creating blog with Jekyll. Fortunately there is work around in this limitation. 

### Problem 
It's common to have a tag or archive page on a blog that display all tags and associate tag with post pages. However for some 
reaso this page is not automatically generated in Jekyll. 

### Solution
