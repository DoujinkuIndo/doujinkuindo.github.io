title: A little bit of Clojure
---

A few months back I set a goal that before graduation I would become comfortable with a few different programming paradigms. I wanted to learn:

1. An Object Oriented "Business" Programming language
2. A scripting language
3. A functional programming language

I felt like this would make me well rounded, and introduce me to different methods of problem solving.

I already knew Java and a bit of bash from school, but I decided that I would learn Ruby as my scripting language, as I don't really enjoy writing anything beyond trivial scripts in bash. I've become pretty comfortable with Ruby over the past few months, which allowed me to start learning Rails too.

I had decided I was going to leave learning a functional language until I started my career, as I didn't really have the time to dedicate to it with all the things I have to learn right now. I'm still trying to study more important things like data structures, algorithms, and databases (I'm taking all of these classes this year). When doing interview prep, I kept running into list and binary (search) tree questions though, and I got really tired of having to create other classes just so I could solve some interview questions. I remembered how easy dealing with lists was back when I programmed in Scheme in my first programming class. I decided I would try either Clojure or Haskell to remedy this, as those two are the most interesting to me right now. I ultimately went with Clojure because it has a lower barrier to entry, the syntax is more immediately familiar due to my prior experience with Scheme, and I see at least a few job postings that would like some Clojure experience, but a lot less for Haskell.

Clojure is pretty fun to write in, but I'm still really bad at it. I don't feel comfortable solving a wide scope of problems in it yet, so maybe this blog post is a bit premature. However, as a consequence of programming in Clojure, I've become much better with recursion. Like, loads better. For some reason my professors think it's enough to show us factorial and fibonacci in every class and expect us to grok recursion. This wasn't the case for me. I've been working through the book _The Little Schemer_ to remedy this, and it has been working wonders. I plan to make a write up of experiences with the book when I'm done, and continue doing this for all the books I manage to make my way through. I also have the solutions to the exercises on [GitHub](https://github.com/MichaelVessia/LittleSchemer).
