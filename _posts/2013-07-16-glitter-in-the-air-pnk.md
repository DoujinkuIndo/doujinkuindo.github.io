# Glitter In The Air-- P!nk

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3stsDXki__U Pop stars are musicians, sure, but first and foremost they’re idols.  They’re who we look up to, who we try to become.  Pop stars connect us.  Our collective love of them is proof that there are other people who feel like we feel, love what we love, want what we want.  P!nk is my pop star.  P!nk is for the those of us who aren’t pretty and prim like Katy Perry or attention-desiring like Gaga or femme-sexy like Beyoncé; the ones who are just messy girls fucking up.  It’s hard to be female-assigned and kind of a bro and see who you wanna be in pop music.  P!nk was the first pop star I ever saw who looked like I wanted to look.  Her hair was short and her voice was deep and she was talking about fucking and she was using language that has been reserved for men.  It would be years til I had the language to know that I was lacking representation in the media.  All I knew when I discovered P!nk was that here, for what seemed like the first time in my entire life, was someone I wanted to be. You guys, I’m really emotional about P!nk. It’s because this song is P!nk’s that I’m able to love it so much.  I’m not huge into love songs.  But this is something else.  Because P!nk is more about kicking ass than anything else, this song becomes incredibly vulnerable.  The desire in it is tangible, and it makes P!nk, a performer we’ve been trained to see as hard and in control, fragile.  Plus, the physicality of the performance in the video above is unbelievable.  And, incredibly, despite how huge it is, simple.  Just like this song.
