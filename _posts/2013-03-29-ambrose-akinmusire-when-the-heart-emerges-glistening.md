# Ambrose Akinmusire — When The Heart Emerges Glistening

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZ5chS_by8 I have some musician friends who are constantly talking about how they saw some show or other and how they hated it because it wasn’t “real jazz”.  This is generally my cue to listen to that performer and enjoy it very much.  Aside from accused contrarian hipsterness, I find that this method works for me because it helps me tap into new ideas. “This guy name ambrose akeenmooseer?  He’s literally the worst musician I’ve ever heard” yes please. Ambrose has a voice that is everything that is great about the classics and everything that is great about the nouveau “what the fuck” stuff.  It’s limitless expression in a context that I can grapple with.    It isn’t coated in the neoclassical like some stuff that my aforementioned friends would dig, but rather lightly dusted. I love the looks on their faces when I tell them that Ambrose studied with all of their “real jazz” idols.
