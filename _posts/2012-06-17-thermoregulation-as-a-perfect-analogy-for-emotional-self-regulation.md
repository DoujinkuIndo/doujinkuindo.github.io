# Thermoregulation as a Perfect Analogy for Emotional Self-Regulation

I think I've been self-regulating. I found someone else who's done the same to disastrous ends. Trying actively to stop is part of self-regulating, noticing I'm self-regulating is part of self-regulating. Seeing earlier, more academic posts and watching the progression as my journal has been taken over entirely by feelings is gross, but an artificial push backwards is no good. I slept in a strange house under blankets and over blankets, around and under a warm body which kept me occasionally too warm or too cold. The night was restless. The strange house had a broken thermostat and large ceiling fans, and the temperature gained and lost ten degrees every thirty minutes continually between 4AM and 10AM. I threw off and dragged on blankets, I distanced myself from the ambient body heat and rejoined. Thermoregulation is difficult. Trying too hard to fix it can cause problems in the opposite direction. Emotional regulation, it's tempting to say, works the same way. I think cutting out feelings entirely simply represses them, causing more feelings down the road. But I think it's no good to be ruled by feelings, which I certainly am at the moment. So I'll walk it back slowly. I'll introduce biological science concepts in journal entries about feelings. We'll see where it gets me.
