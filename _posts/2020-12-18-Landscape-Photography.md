> I've flown my Mavic Air 2 for about 6 months now and I have loved it. I've really enjoyed getting up in the air and taking the best photos that I can. Here's a couple of my favorite photos that I've taken.

### Landscape Photography/My first 6 months as a Drone Pilot

#### **This is where I live:**

I live about 5-10 minutes from Lake Pend Orielle and I've lived here for a while and had never seen Mount Pend Orielle; so I drove up to Lunch Peak to see it. In this photo the drone is at 6,800 feet elevation, 400 feet above the 6400ft Lunch Peak. On the right is Mount Pend Orielle, and in the distance on the left is the lake with the same name.

#### Idaho/Montana Border:

On the same trip I took this photo of Moose Mountain, and other Montana Mountains that I could see from Idaho's airspace. I bet you can tell which mountain is Moose Mountain.

#### This is at Priest Lake:

I happened to be in Priest Lake right after it snowed and I had my drone - was very happy with how this photo turned out. I simply pulled over on the side of the road and flew and captured this.

### What's next? 

> I have been looking at sportier drones that are more suited for flying very quickly and around obstacles. My Mavic Air 2 is phenomenal - just look at these 5 shots on panoramic mode! I have to lower the quality on my photos significantly to display them here. My Mavic serves a specific purpose, which to me is the photos. For videos, I need to be flying - and RACING - FPV. Stay tuned!
