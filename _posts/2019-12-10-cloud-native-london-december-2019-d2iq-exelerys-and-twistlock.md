For our Xmas meetup, Cloud Native London December started off with some delicious food (hope you enjoyed the Lebanese this year!), followed by three great talks. Catch up on the talks and video of the whole evening [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jxA2X0pFS0pmtHUnsZvnCcJhdHR_X6MV)!

Our fantastic speakers for the evening were Matt Jarvis from D2iQ, Jesus Escolar from EXELERYS and Ashley Ward from Twistlock. Thanks also to our sponsors [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Contino](https://www.contino.io/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/),  [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com), [D2iQ](https://d2iq.com), [Twistlock](https://www.twistlock.com) and [OVH](https://www.ovh.co.uk).

First up, Matt was Introducing Kudo (starting at 09:30). His takeaways are:

* Running stateful applications on Kubernetes is still pretty tricky.
* Writing operators for stateful applications is hard, it takes a lot of code and deep understanding of Kubernetes and the stateful app itself.
* The KUDO project can simplify the operator development process, in most cases just using YAML.

Next up, Jesus Escolar returned to tell us about Securing DevOps CI/CD Pipelines in the Cloud (starting at 43:40). He mentioned that:

* Security for DevOps is in an heterogenous unharmonized state. Search and Use the right tools for your business.
* DevSecOps is now critical part of the framework for cloud DevOps adoption. Integrate them properly.
* The legacy security issues are mainstream for DevOps. Dust old security books. Apply #ZeroTrust!

Finally, Ashley rounded off our evening with a talk on The Age of the Cloud Native Security Platform (starting 1:24:50). He concluded that: 

* Cloud native compute doesn't just mean pushing everything to serverless.  There are many options that will change (often) depending on your workload and organisation.
* The ephemeral and dynamic nature of these workloads means that traditional security tooling can't keep up and native cloud tools aren't enough.
* Cloud Native Security Platform is an all in one security toolset to cover all aspects of the cloud native platform.
