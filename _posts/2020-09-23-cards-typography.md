- Preserve text line length with flexbox.

## 2. Google Fonts
### Learning Objectives
- Create visual hierarchy with `font-size`.
- Create visual hierarchy with `font-family`.
- Import two custom fonts from an online font service.

### Activity: Hero taglines
You will be working in pairs for this activity.

2. Import 2 of your favourite fonts from Google Fonts.
3. Using differences in typeface and `font-size`, create a visual hierarchy between the hero section heading and tagline.
4. Are there any other changes you can make to enhance the visual hierarchy of the entire hero section?
