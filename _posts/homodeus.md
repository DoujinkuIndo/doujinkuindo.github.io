title: Some thoughts on Homo Deus
---

On two separate occasions people came to me to recommend me Yuval Noah's [Homo Deus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus?from_search=true) after I presented my research for the Flemish PhD cup. My example of using machine learning algorithms to recommend personalized medicines was apparently very much in line with the main thesis of this book. Intrigued, I added it to my reading list and now, two months later, I would like to share some of my notes and thoughts about Homo Deus.

Departing from evolution, Homo Deus discusses what makes humans the dominant species on the planet. Our main successful trait is not the intelligence of an *individual*, rather it is our uncanny talent for *organizing* ourselves. To this end, we have developed a whole range of abstract tools to organize masses: religion, writing, currency, nations, laws, economics etc. There is a Darwinian process going on: tools that are better in mobilizing people for a cause are used more. These processes have become so intertwined with our lives that we feel dominated by human constructs such as our values, the law, religion rather than the laws of nature. We put ourselves in the hands of entities bigger than ourselves: be it God or the state.

In the latter couple of decennia, our lives are determined by new entities: computer algorithms. Companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook determine what sites we visit, what goods we should buy, which advertisements are most relevant to us and which people we should like. And they are good at telling us what to do, because they use our data to do so. Noah coins the term *Datasism* for this: using Big Data as a basis for society.

- and often know us better than we know ourselves
- beter dan dokter, zelfrijdende autos etc
- ontkoppeling van bewustzijn en intelligentie (lik met Bostron)
- kosmisch proces : natuur wil een zo efficient mogelijk data verwerkend systeem worden. [link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116623.Decoding_the_Universe)
