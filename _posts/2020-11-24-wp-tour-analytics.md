## 1. WP Tour
### Key Takeaways
1. Plugins
    - The number one source of blog bloat:
        - Beware of client projects that have more than 20 plugins;
        - Beware of plugins that are more than a major version out of date;
        - Beware of plugins that are no longer maintained.
2. Posts - great for content that:
    - has an author(s);
    - has a category;
        - See Codex: [Post Categories](https://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/categories/)
    - can be tagged;
        - See Codex: [Post Tags](https://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/tags/)
    - has a date:
        - is organized by date;
        - needs to be scheduled.
    - each post type can be assigned a page template
        - See Codex: [Post Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/post-template-files/)
    - don't support custom templates
    - can be customized by setting a [Post Format](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/post-formats/) (the theme must explicitly support this)
3. Pages - great for content that:
    - is important enough to be in the primary navigation;
    - doesn't change often;
    - requires structured layouts
        - See Codex: 
            - [Page Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/)
                - [Custom Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/#creating-a-custom-page-template-for-one-specific-page)
                - [Template Partials](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/partial-and-miscellaneous-template-files/#content-slug-php)
            - Note: Template pages overide custom pages
