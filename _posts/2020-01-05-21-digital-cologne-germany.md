I was invited to be the ecosystem lead at [#21 Digital](https://www.21digital.events/), an event run by [Cassini Consulting](https://www.cassini.de/). We discussed three different kinds of ecosystems through a day of workshop, including the sharing economy, standardizing IoT platforms, and the knowledge economy.
