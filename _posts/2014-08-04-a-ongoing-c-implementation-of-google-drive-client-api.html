<p>I am currently developing a C++ implementation of Google drive client api for fun. <a href="https://github.com/allenbo/gdrive" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
<p>This is just another toy project out of time killing and enjoyment. For now I implemented the file operations' interface such as get, put, copy, delete and update. You could find more details in my github. Since my internship started to become intense and I have to put more efforts on what I've been paid to do, I should expose this toy project to public and hope some one would show interests and help me develop it together. If you are "some one", please show no hesitation to fork and pull. That would be a lot of fun.</p>
