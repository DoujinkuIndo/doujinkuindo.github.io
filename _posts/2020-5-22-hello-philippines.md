### Welcome to Pinoy Programmer!
This is my very first blog post and I am excited to share my knowledge and experience to the Filipino developer community and hopefully collaborate with some of the great minds in the industry. I am so grateful to have stumbled upon <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for writing this blog. I feel that it is a great tool especially for me as a developer. I get to write my posts in my favorite text editor and use Git to publish it on my <a href="https://github.com/thepinoyprogrammer" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>!
