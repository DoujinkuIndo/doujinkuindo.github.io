title: 'Now with Light and Dark Mode'

By popular demand this site now supports both a light and a dark theme. There is no explicit way to switch between light and dark mode, instead the site will adapt to the browser preferences.

Although I am a giant proponent of dark mode for everything, there seem to be people who prefer light mode. I don't get it, but light mode folks should feel welcome on this blog as well. To implement the light and dark mode support, I used [this guide](https://derekkedziora.com/blog/dark-mode-revisited) by Derek Kedziora. Thanks to this helpful human who posted a simple and elegant solution.
