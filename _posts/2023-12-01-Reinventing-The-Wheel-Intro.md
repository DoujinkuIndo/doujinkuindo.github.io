Greetings friends and welcome to the beginning of what hopefully becomes something unique and interesting. This is going to be a long running series where we build out various components of the modern computing stack beginning with an operating sytem, drivers, compiler, etc. The whole shebang. I have never attempted to do something this ambitious and have no idea how long this will take, probably a few years. This is going to be a long learning journey for me and I hope to document my progress here to solidify concepts for myself and share what I'm doing with others. I am sure I will make many mistakes along the way, and I will also document what I go back and change. 

I will begin writing this project for x86 but hopefully will add support for RISC-V and possibly ARM in the future as well. 


In the the next post I will go over project setup, build tools, and get a simple bootloader rolled so we can start programming in a high level language. 

Get ready to reinvent the WheelOS.
