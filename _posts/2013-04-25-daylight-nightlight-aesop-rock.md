# Daylight / Nightlight — Aesop Rock

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd_W_x3nclY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLG4gP16LRY This duet of songs is, together, a phenomenal work, in any medium — as rap, fast and hard, it's difficult to parse — but phenomenal nonetheless. It's a diptych, two works designed to complement each other. Each stands apart, but _Nightlight_ is a dark parody of _Daylight_, which is an idealistic _Nightlight_, which... etc. Compare the lyrics side by side — no, go do it, use google, I'll wait. The production is similar but with contrast; the lyrics are mirrors, the tempo is the same, his done and flow is the same on each track. The idea is so brilliant, it's amazing nobody had done it before. Because it exists within its own self-reflective universe, I don't really have any associations with a place or time — it's more like a book or a film, in that respect. It exists in and of itself.
