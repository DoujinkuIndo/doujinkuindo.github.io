title: End of the fall semester 2015
---

Well, technically, it's already the spring semester here in the Czech Republic..
but so much stuff happened a few weeks back that I didn't have time to write about it then.

First of all, I passed all 7 of my exams! Think I'm getting the hang of this slowly.
Also, during that, I managed to attend [DevConfCZ 2016]({{site.url}}/DevConfCZ2016), which was just a blast.

As a reward, we went skiing to South Tyrol/Northern Dolomites/Northern Italy.
Technically, it was a university course -- but (thankfully) only on paper.
Four days of pure skiing and hanging out with cool people of all ages,
most of them from [Matfyz]({{site.url}}/My-first-year-at-Matfyz).

I collected.

Regarding my plans for the future:

* Studying, d'oh! The spring semester is going to be tough (9 courses, 8 exams)
* A major research/software project at school (trying to come up with a topic that would accentuate or even be followed up by my bachelor thesis next year)
* Look for some summer employment/internship opportunities!
