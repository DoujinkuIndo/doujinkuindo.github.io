Let's say we have a loop that only terminates when killed by system shutdown. What would make that loop interesting?

{% highlight python %}
while True:
	
	print("Hello, world!")
else:
	print("Goodbye!")
{% endhighlight %}

In the meantime I'll be at [contrafactum](https://github.com/contrafactum/) on GitHub.
