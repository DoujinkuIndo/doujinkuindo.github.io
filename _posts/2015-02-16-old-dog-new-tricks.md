A loop that only terminates when killed.

{% highlight python %}
while True:
	print("Hello, world. Coffee time!")
	time.sleep(86400)
else:
	# Nothing. We'll never hit this line.
{% endhighlight %}

What if we add a few new tricks? In the meantime I'll be at [contrafactum](https://github.com/contrafactum/) on GitHub.
