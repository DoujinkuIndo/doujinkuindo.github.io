# This Protector — The White Stripes

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv_eIFpFMiA Branching out is always a good idea; almost always rewarding, generally successful, and often phenomenal. One-hit wonders are bands that experiment in just the right way, but can't do it again. Phenomenal musicians are constantly experimenting, good musicians experimented enough to hit a stride. It's a process where you're constantly changing, but you don't always have to be changing the way in which you're changing. This is the Calc II in me speaking. _This Protector_ is not a typical [White Stripes](http://www.whitestripes.com/) song, I think. They're dirty south, New Orleans soul with distortion, beat poetry as heavy garage rock. But here, they branch out. It's like folk song in its simplicity, nearly a chant in its repetition, and a sermon in its content. I don't know what to make of it, and maybe they didn't either. I've listened to it more times than all other White Stripes songs combined. Something tickled.
