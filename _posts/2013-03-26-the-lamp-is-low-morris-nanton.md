# The Lamp Is Low — Morris Nanton

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFfl_PVXD30 Jazz is an echo chamber. Come here and be alone with your thoughts; get them moving, get them changing, pick up another idea or two. Settle in and listen and ponder; get up and dance; change and change and change. _The Lamp Is Low_ is from the 1930s; apparently there are lyrics? It came to me ass-backwards; through [Nujabes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9hwjQBQFIo)'s sample of the [Laurindo Almeida](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viapUCZXSqg) rendition, but the above 1967 rendition is the one that tickles me the best. Explore on [WhoSampled](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/92673/Nujabes-Aruarian%20Dance_Laurindo%20Almeida-The%20Lamp%20Is%20Low/); do [research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lamp_Is_Low); trace your own path backwards in time through the history of this Jazz standard. Listen for it in old movies; let it pop into your head during tests; lose yourself in its tone and rhythm. This is what music is for.
