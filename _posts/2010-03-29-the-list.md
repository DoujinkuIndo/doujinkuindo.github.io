Some people have bucket lists, life achievements or activities they want to ensure are crossed off before they kick the bucket. That seemed boring to me, so I decided to narrow it down to the next year or two. Or 5. I&#8217;ll keep extending it when I realise I have no chance of accomplishing it in a particular timeframe.

The rules? None really, other than to just do things in the most interesting, out there or oddball ways possible.

I&#8217;ll add to the list later, but here&#8217;s a starter:  
See 100 gigs/shows/festivals in 2010  
Live overseas for at least 12 months  
Visit japan  
Go to the Fest in Florida  
Drive coast to coast in the USA  
Bungee jump  
Put on a gig  
Play in a band  
Another piercing  
Swim in the atlantic ocean  
See some American sports â€“ nba, baseball, nfl, hockey, etc  
Wind up in the local media of somewhere overseas (ie. Make your way into a news item on tv/in the newspaper/etc, or get interviewed/photographed)
