# First Fires — Bonobo

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHotQANrGCE Bonobo, who defies description: electronic, processed, live and organic, modern British trip-hop, the sensibility of a modern producer and the soul of a cinematic composer, silent and calm and collected, and emotive, through strings and blips and guest vocalists. This is music for and by the producer — not for dancing, not for partying; not for sulking, not for walking around; not for action or stubborn inaction — it is for sitting and appreciating, letting yourself be washed over by it.
