# What ? intro ...
Dockers.. think of them as a ship with containers on it. You know which one i am talking about ?... anyway, They are awesome for security of device(embedded).

Docker is a set of services that use OS level virtualization to run self-contained instances of software. wow big sentence !
what that means is i dont have to virtulize the os everytime to run a service like website or ftp server. Each service is virtulized vs OS and Service.
