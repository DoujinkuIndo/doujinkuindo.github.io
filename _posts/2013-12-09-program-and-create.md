## To Program is to Create

I am in an interesting position. Two weeks ago i passed my assessment to move onto the final phase of DevBootcamp, the phase in which we begin to learn rails and then go on to build a final project. As the weekend before phase 3 began I caught the stomach flu and had to sit out the first 3 days which left me far too behind to be useful to my group. Instead I was given the offer to defer and wait for the next phase 3 which would begin three weeks later. This turned out to be a beautiful opportunity.

The last few weeks have given me the chance to hone in my web development skills by giving me time toboth go through tutorials at my own pace and build programs for the sake of challenge. I have began to understand that the web apps I build will have meaning for me only if I build them meaningfully. As I was moving through phase two I had no choice but to focus on learning how to build the skeleton and then move on to the next challenge. This is understandeable, as the speed of the program was such that there was neverenough time and always more to be done. So I was building apps that worked, but they looked awful and i had no real connection to them.

As I moved into this defered phase, I was given the opportunity to slow down and create things with care. The projects I worked on might have been smaller, but i spent time on the aesthetic feel which, in turn, created a connection with my project that drove me to spend more time on it.
