# The Immutability of the Lower East Side, the Mutability of the Future, and A Rumination On The Similarities Thereof

I drove down the FDR this afternoon, and back up it this evening. When I left it was light out, and now it is dark. Visibility is about the same, but it's the difference between seeing the textures and details and intimacies of a building or a skyline, and seeing the shapes and colors and impressions. Driving down I saw the backs of hospitals and bridges and the bustle of streets. I saw into tenement house windows and I saw the backs of cars and the undersides of tunnels. It was bright out, a nice day, but I saw too much. Driving up again I saw a big skyline of lower east side Manhattan, the shapes of monolithic buildings reflected off the water, the quiet suburbs of Brooklyn and Queens across the way; the apartment buildings were romantic ideas. Look at all the people who live here. Look how big it is, and look how small I am, and look how much city there is to exist within. But it was all the same city. Things change. Things change when you look at them, and things change when you don't look at them. Yet a better rule is: things surprise you. You're not as good as you would like to be. Things always change, except when you expect them to. Then they never change. The bridge and the tram and the ferry look just the same in the dark. Roosevelt Island still looks friendly and mysterious over the water. The backs of cars still look like the backs of cars. But the city, at once immutable and infinitely variable, changed with every turn of the road. You would expect it not to. Concrete and steel and glass, and driving up the road it reconfigured itself at every turn. I'm going to have a very different life from how I expected for a few months. I'm not sure what the point would be in saying to myself: "that's okay". It wouldn't matter much. The future isn't much different from the past, really. It's just us, finding a point in time and saying: this is me, right now. This is what I know, this is what I don't. But things will change, and the point moves, and you know more and expect less, and then your horizons jump again and you know less and expect more. And even in the amount of change and the path the change takes, there is change. Can I say that: I'm not going to worry about it? Because that'll change. But I will try. I will try not to worry about it, I will try not to control it, I will try to do my best. And I will always try to try.
