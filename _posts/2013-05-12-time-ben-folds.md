# Time — Ben Folds

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmE4r7i-rLY I don't know how I feel about Ben Folds. At a time, I loved him — thought his music was perfection, produced and measured and talented (it still is) — thought his lyrics were heart-wrenchingly honest, confessional, true and observant and relevant (they still are) — thought his content was brilliant and prescriptive, the way life _really_ was, helpful to listen to (it isn't). I've changed my mind, I think. Talent nonwithstanding, his meditations on relationships (especially this song) are unhealthy, condescending, counterproductive, and just generally shitty. There's a heavy undercurrent of preachy, holier-than-thou in his work, and it's hard to notice when you're a preachy, holier-than-thou middle-schooler. I still love it, and it's still great, but it's no longer prescriptive — now it's descriptive, music I listen to when I'm feeling blue or bitter or mad. Not music to be in love to.
