Love that GitHub now has free private repos.

I'm working on a little project right now that's just a simple way to use some data, do some web scraping, and provide a service that I'll use pretty often.

Being able to have a free repo to push to and pull from on the server makes this whole process a lot easier. Still working on getting the domain set up and some email notifications, but it's getting there.

Rust is moving along slowly, but has taken a bit of a backseat since I can hammer out Flask APIs pretty quickly with Python currently.
