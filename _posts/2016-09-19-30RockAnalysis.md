title: A Not-So Literary Analysis of 30 Rock Post-Mania

To be honest, I have not done the readings for this class for today (09-19). I know that we don't necessarily have to talk about the readings in these blog posts, but that is what I like to do and I have not been able to meet my standard. Unfortunatly, this weekend I found out my best friend, Tom, was admitted (and now released) into a psych ward. He had been in a bi-polar mania for weeks without knowing it and thank goodness his parents happened to visit him and find him in this mess. I've spent the last 5 or so days talking to Tom and try to be as supportive as I can in his fragile state. 

Now I don't know a lot about bi-polar disorder, but I do know a lot about mental illness from experience. So to try and keep the mood light after we talked about the serious stuff, we binged 30 Rock. This show is a favorite for the both of us, therefore it was a no brainer to watch it. But as we were watching, Tom started to talk about the way Tina Fey wrote the show and how all of the characters were different facets of herself. He claims this is why the show is so successful because as an audience we have the opportunity to relate to all aspects of our own personalities without taking things too seriously. I believe this statement can be made about most, if not all, television shows, but Tom was making connections from Tina Fey's bibliography to the show that I've never saw before. 

I wish I had more time and details to start a proper analysis of 30 Rock, but I am happy Tom brought it back into my life. I am so thankful for him.
