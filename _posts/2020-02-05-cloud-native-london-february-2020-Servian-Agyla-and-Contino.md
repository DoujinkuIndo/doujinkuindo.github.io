First up, Byron Allen from Servian told us about The Cheesy Analogy of MLflow and Kubeflow (starting at [06:15](https://youtu.be/gxd8h9ddnxQ?t=375)). His takeaways are:

* ML Engineers, Data Engineers and DevOps need to consider the 'Production ML' value chain or equivalent when selecting MLOps tools and figuring out how to work together.
* MLFlow is great as it is lightweight, versatile and easy to use with the simple pattern Byron explained, and it scales well to production.
* Kubeflow, also an open-source favorite, is more complex and offers a powerful system for practitioners who are Kubernetes  capable and ready to deploy ML models 'in anger'.

Next up, Ines Cheikhrouhou from Agyla described Cloud native disaster recovery in Cloud (starting at [42:07](https://youtu.be/gxd8h9ddnxQ?t=2527)). She concluded that:

* There a lot of things to look after before planning for disaster recovery such as how your application is deployed and your architecture. (containers)
* Planning steps to follow such as organizing for DR and deciding on some keys. (communication, backup plan, RPO and RTO)
* How to start with the Pilot light and move to the full picture with continued tests and improvements.

Finally,  Jai Campbell from Contino rounded off our evening with My Journey into Site Reliability Engineering (starting [1:21:35](https://youtu.be/gxd8h9ddnxQ?t=4895)). He left us with these takeaways from his recent experiences drawn from his professional journey into the world of site reliability engineering:

* A description of the SRE core principles moving onto new skills that needed to be acquired to make the transition from a sysadmin to a site reliability engineer.
* The challenges and successes that came with making the choice to move 100% into Cloud and SRE and how the tools of the CNCF ecosystem became my best friends.
* Advice and information on where to start your own personal journey into SRE with links to subject matter books,  an SRE curated Github repository and an open invitation to join a London based SRE community.
