title: How many light verbs are too many?
---

## What are light verbs?
Light verbs are verbs that contain very little information on their own. Verbs such as "to be", "to have", and "to do" are some of the most common light verbs. 

Otto Jesperson first coined the term **light verb** in *A Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles* to refer to verbs which, though they may have a fuller semantic usage in other contexts, can be used in combination with some other element, typically a noun or verb, where their contribution to the meaning of the whole construction is reduced in some way. [from the internet]

## Why don't we want them?

We often want to avoid them, or at least avoid overusing them. Light verbs can create nominalizations (see the nominalization blog post for more).

Light verbs may contain meaning, or sometimes even a little meaning, so they should not be removed without thought. The point of highlighting them is to suggest you reread those sentences and see is there's a way you can drive the sentence better without the use of a light verb.

## What are all the light verbs?

There's no official list, but I would include any form of the follow verbs:  *to do*, *to have*, *to make*, *to be*, *to take*, *to begin*, *to get*, *to go*, *to give*, *to put*, *to feel*, *to begin*.

## How bad are they?

Fortunately, it's OK to have quite a few light verbs in your writing. A good way to see this is to look to the classics.

In general, it looks like anywhere between 30-45% of your verbs can be light verbs.



*Light verbs are sometimes called weak verbs, but the term weak verbs can also be used to describe verbs that form a past tense through a standard pattern (walk -> walked instead of run -> ran).
