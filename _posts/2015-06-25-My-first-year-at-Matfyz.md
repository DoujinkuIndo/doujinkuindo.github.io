title: My first year at Matfyz
---

Today is the end of my first year at [Matfyz](http://mff.cuni.cz).
It was a long year and yet it went by so fast.
I met a lot of wonderful people and even made a few friends.
We studied a lot, learned a lot and there is still a lot more to be learned.
I'm looking forward to next year!

Summer is approaching and I'm really excited to start my summer internship in a couple weeks.
Sometime during the Spring I've been contacted by [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) with the possibility
of an offer for an internship this year in Brno, Czech Republic.
A few interviews later I was confident that this summer is going to be a very exciting
and rewarding experience to which I'm looking forward!
