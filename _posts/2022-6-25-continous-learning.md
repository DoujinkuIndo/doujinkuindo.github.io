# Continuous learning

### What took so long?

When I started this blog I wanted to keep this as a low effort one and not stress about when I'm posting. I feel this casual six months in-between therefore is quite the approriate amount! 

### The continuous part

One of the easiest ways to gain new knowledge while traveling and doing other tasks is via podcasts. I've spent quite a bit of time in the last year listening to security podcast and got curious about the amount of time spent.

So I decided to go through my Spotify listening history using a <a href="https://github.com/TheSnowWight/SpotifyDataParser">data parser</a> and look at the time spent for security podcasts. On my listening history I could see the following podcasts.

<ul>
  <li>Open Source Security Podcast</li>
 <li>Darknet Diaries</li>
 <li>Cybersecurity Today</li>
 <li>Decoding Security</li>
 <li>The Official Offensive Security Podcast</li>
 <li>The Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show</li>
 <li>mnemonic security podcast</li>
 <li>Smashing Security</li>
</ul>

Based on the data I noticed that on average I've listened to security podcasts roughly 126 hours. Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but divided with 365 days you end up with ~20 minutes.

That means for the last year I've spent roughly 20minutes each day listening for security podcasts...

That amount of listening is bound to make some information stick in ones noggin!

### Security podcast recommendations

From the podcasts listed above, these two currently rank the highest on my list

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/category/podcast/">Open Source Security Podcast</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/">Darknet Diaries</a></li>
</ul>

While I do approach Jack, Josh & Kurt and the amazing work they do :heart:, I would like to find **security podcasts hosted by people with more diverse backgrounds**.
If you know any good ones, send me a msg over on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TheSnowWight">twitter</a>!
