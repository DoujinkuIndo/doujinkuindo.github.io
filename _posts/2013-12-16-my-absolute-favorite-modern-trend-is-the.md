My absolute favorite modern trend is the combination with hard-as-fuck rap vocals with Saturday Morning cartoon theme songs. This is not nearly as obscure a genre as one might imagine. Beginning in 2007 with this mashup of *Biggie Smalls*' **Come On** with the *Thomas the Tank Engine* theme song:

This is a remarkably extensive genre. One of the main pioneers is *K'Nuckles*, tellingly named after the Sonic character. Here's *Big Boi*'s **Shutterbug** with the **Wallace and Gromit** theme song.

And here's *DMX* rapping over **Rudolph the Raindeer**.

And, of course, *Bubba Sparxxx*'s **Miss New Booty** over **Under The Sea**, from <span>The Little Mermaid</span>.

It's difficult to quantify exactly why these are so popular. I think a lot of it is the shock/humor value: this is a juxtaposition nobody expects. It's a gotcha. But, to read a little bit too much into it, it's a reminder of the range and flexibility of music itself, that it can cater to such disparate genres and audiences.
