##ABOUT ME

Howdy and welcome to my website! My name is Charles Thomas and I am a senior Technology management student at Texas A&M . 
This page was made for my 476 class, and contains a page about me. The site was written using basic HTML and then served through githubpages and jekyll.
howdy; like I said, I am a senior Technology Management student. I am minoring in business and cyber security, and I studied computer science for 2 years before switching majors, completing the lower capstone course: programming studio. I decided to switch into Technology Management after attending a Cyber Security Club meeting and A&M, which is where I first heard about the tech management major. Since winning the Air Force national championship title in the Cyber Patriot cyber defense competition in high school, I have wanted pursue a career that is related to security, both offensive and defensive. I have strong personal and professional interest in the area of information/network security, and hope to work in the field one day. My personal interests include music, video games, and motorcycles, specifically dirt bikes.
