We had two fantastic speakers from esynergy and NVIDIA joining our August Cloud Native London meetup at esynergy. We also had virtual attendees joining us via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was David Oliver from esynergy with a great discussion on Taking a legacy application to the cloud (starting at [27:13](https://youtu.be/ZCGO0IV1uHI?t=1633)). He talked about how to:

* When the organisation forces a migration to Kubernetes on team, the non technical factors become much more important
* While developers are change makers they don’t all like change themselves
* Everyone has their own idea of what’s important in a platform if you are using someone else’s make sure you check it has what you need

Then we had Jacob Tomlinson from NVIDIA wrapping up our evening with a talk on Testing and validating container images with Container Canary (starting at [1:02:39](https://youtu.be/ZCGO0IV1uHI?t=3759)). His takeaways talked about why: 

* You should test your container images
* Platforms should validate container images when they allow users to bring their own
* You should use Container Canary!

And of course, our usual group photo!
