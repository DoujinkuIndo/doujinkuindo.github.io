# Thank You (feat. Apani B.) — Nujabes

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnba1fKRNZo I've written about Nujabes in other articles, but never about him directly — he has a distinctive sound, but he doesn't write his lyrics and he doesn't write the instrumentals — he samples. As such, he is a curator; it's easy to attribute the music to him, but it's much easier to look at the individual artist (incidentally, Apani B., who I've _never_ heard of before, _absolutely kills it here_), and his samples of [Gypsy Queen — Part Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=WINGFnluveI) and [Modesty Blaise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ydMw4zor9iE) (which _I guarantee you know_), while brilliant for their selection, are nearly unedited; how much credit can I really give him? I love his output, I love the music he puts out, but it's... is it creation? Apani B. wrote the lyrics, which are what I listen to with intention; the instrumentals are large bands full of people, written and arranged and produced by someone else uncredited; what did Nujabes do? Not to say I could do it, but... what work of his can I talk about? But I do love his choices — his choice of vocalist, his choice of sample — and that's enough, I think. Everything about the creative process is choices. If I praise another artist, it's for their choices — in lyric, instrumentation, all the same. He's just a content aggregator, a modern musician. Perhaps undeserving of the same claims to _talent_, but certainly not to _fame_.
