# Burden of Tomorrow — The Tallest Man on Earth

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOlm4OIpx4s I first heard _The Tallest Man on Earth_ at Cornell a few summers ago — it was folk, idyllic, sad and fast and melancholy, energetic with underlying currents, restless and brilliant and poetic, and I loved it despite myself — it was descriptive, not prescriptive, but of course you can't police yourself constantly, I listened anyway. But only recently did I get a full album, and this song, the second fucking song, has been a stumbling block; I'll listen and try to go onwards, but I only want to listen to this song over and over and over, and it's been three days and I'm not yet tired of it. There are some moments where his voice reaches an octave above where I previously expected (1:41, etc) and it is just pure and magical. I am so in love.
