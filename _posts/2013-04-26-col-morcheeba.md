# Col — Morcheeba

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYPra-5tfeo There is a quality to this sort of music; it is deliberate, cold, sterile, but overwhelming with emotion and detail and intent; it tells a story, or gets across a mood, or a time and place, as I try to do — but it does so with such force, fueled by this _need_ to communicate, as though it can't be kept inside any more — these are songs that come across well to newcomers. All media can be repeated — TV is the least rewatchable. Movies, often. Books, almost always. But music, I have to. I can't take it all in on the first listen. Part of the fun is learning the patterns of music and letting the song itself remind you of the pattern and then deliberately lead you astray; to be surprised by the bridge; to remember and misremember the lyrics, to suddenly realize what a song is about — this is a property I think is unique. Col struck me immediately as important, but only after many listens do I appreciate it for what it is — a eulogy.
