title: Hello Jekyll Now
---

I've setup this site using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and I'm hopeful it might be where I transfer my exising [blog](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/) to. The blog prior to now has been powered by WordPress, this (currently) test site is powered by Jekyll.

It would mean an export of those posts from WordPress into markdown files, and the use of [custom domains on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

Why the change? <!--more-->I'm wanting to write content in markdown, in a git repo. What this does for me is twofold:

1. I start working with the tools (primarily git) the dev team is using
2. It means I can simplify the production and hosting of the site

Lets see how this test goes :)

If successful, then I'll push this to the world, and the blog will then be powered by Jekyll rather than WordPress.
