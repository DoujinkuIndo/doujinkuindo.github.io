This blog now has a comment functionality. I can switch on comments for individual posts and everyone with a GitHub account is able to comment.

I have copied the brilliant idea of [Ari Stathopoulos](https://github.com/aristath) which he explained in [this post](https://aristath.github.io/blog/static-site-comments-using-github-issues-api) on his personal blog. The comment system uses the GitHub Issues API. Everyone with a GitHub account can comment on the issue linked in a commentable post. Comments appear on the page instantly. I like this solution a lot since it is completely open source and does not bothers visitors with trackers like disqus does.
