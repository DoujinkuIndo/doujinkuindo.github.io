# H1 Say What?! Hello to the Internet World!!

Till yesterday I was unaware about what in the world Jekyll is. And today it seems I am writing my first blog using it.
What an astonishing turn of events, I had been spending time to understand the basics of Django to build my own portfolio and now I am building my portfolio using Jekyll.

I believe there are two types of happenings; The ones which we know before time and the others that just happen without a prior notice.
This is one of the latter kinds for me.
As an avid learner and more of the learn on the fly kinda guy, I want to happily state that today marks the beginning of a new journey... #H3 a journey of learning...
# H3 A journey to be remembered...
# H3 A journey towards the field of Data Science and Analytics ...
# H3 A journey towards being the #DataKnight Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. (if you didn't get, its a Batman reference)

If you woud like to join me on this journey, please do hop on. I believe in saying "the more the merrier".

Stay Tuned!!
And yeah Happy ThanksGiving!!
