> Asked about samatha (calm) and vipassana (insight) meditation, a well-known contemporary Thai meditation teacher commented at the end of
his reply: "These days many people cling to the words. They call their practice vipassanii. Samatha is looked down on. Or they call their practice samatha.
It is essential to do samatha before vipassana, they say. "1 This summarizes quite exactly a debate which is frequently encountered in Thailand and, using a slightly different terminology, in Sri Lanka also. It seemed therefore useful to re-examine the use of these two terms in the earlier Pali literature, hoping to see exactly how ancient this kind of usage is and whether there is any clear position on the matter in the classical texts.
For the purposes of this investigation I shall treat the earliest stratum of Pali literature as consi&ting of the Vinaya texts (excluding the Parivara),
the first four Nikayas and the Sutta-Nipilta. It is, of course, obvious that there is some historical stratification within these works. However, I do not accept that there are adequate criteria available for a convincing analysis into distinct periods. Nor is sufficient historical information available to
determine the likely time-scale for such periods.
