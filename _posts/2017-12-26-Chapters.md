# Getting back what we lost when going digital

Definitely there's something more in reading a book than just looking at printed words. The physicality of a book is often overlooked. Its body gives us a lot of unspoken information, such as length and progress, organically used for knowing if you're getting closer to the end or for intantly jumping to another part of the story.

There's no denying in the obvious advantages of digital books. But they're still far from replacing the experience of reading their physical counterparts.

This concept app aimed for demostrating there's still room to grow for our favorite ebook readers. 

# Where am I?

The most important thing digital readers have yet to nail is spacial awareness. Current interfaces only partially deal with the issue by showing your progress as a percentage value.

I was looking for an UI element better charged with meaning and affordance that could be relied on througought the reading experience.

# Introducing: The Bookmark

Taking a cue on a physical one, The Bookmark is always on the side when your digital book is open. Inside the app, it serves 2 main purposes:

## Progress bar

It let you know where you are, all the time.

## Interactive progress skimmer

Being the embodiment of the reading's progress. it makes you can also use it to jump, skim and even navigate by chapters.

# Other design decisions

I chose to set a paged vertical scrolling view inside the books, not only for complementing The Bookmark's orientation, but mainly for respecting the way people navigate their content on a mobile device.

Also, one of the first decisions I've made was having a black background when reading. Rested eyes for everyone!
