Two fantastic speakers from Styra and PolyScale.ai joined us at our February Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat Takeaway offices, plus virtual attendees via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) and [Styra](https://www.styra.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Charlie Egan from Styra with a talk about Using SPIFFE and OPA to Authenticate and Authorize Workloads (starting at [11:59](https://www.youtube.com/live/Asw81cQag44?feature=share&t=719)). His takeaways mentioned:

* What makes a good workload identity
* SPIFFE is a promising standard to consolidate platform workload identities
* When you have a standard identity, shared policies controls is easier

Next up we had Ben Hagan from PolyScale.ai with a discussion on The Complexities of Database Caching at the Edge (starting at [47:37](https://www.youtube.com/live/Asw81cQag44?feature=share&t=2857)). He talked about how: 

* Caching gets complicated very quickly, with even small projects being time consuming and error prone, requiring complex testing and observability.
* Caching across multiple regions can quickly lead to consistency issues and different traffic patterns require different cache configurations.
* PolyScale.ai offers a possible solution, using automation to actively manage and configure the cache in real-time.

Unfortunately we had a technical issue with our third speaker’s talk, so apologies to anyone who joined us to hear from Kale Oum Nivrathi from JFrog, but he’ll be joining us at a future event.

And of course, our usual group photo!
