This blog, and this analysis was created as the first real step in my data science journey, as part of the [metis bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/).  With four others - [Gray Davidson](https://github.com/Gray-Davidson-00/), [Arthur Meng](https://github.com/massdropper/), [Nicholas Beshouri](https://github.com/nbeshouri/), and [Joyce Tang](https://github.com/joyceetng00/) - we formed __Scrappy Data Solutions__, a (clearly) deeply knowledgable and experienced data science consultancy.

__WIP__
