title: Project Benson - A Subway Traffic Analysis
published: true
---
This blog, and this analysis was created as the first real step in my data science journey, as part of the [metis bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/).  With four others - [Gray Davidson](https://github.com/Gray-Davidson-00/), [Arthur Meng](https://github.com/massdropper/), [Nicholas Beshouri](https://github.com/nbeshouri/), and [Joyce Tang](https://github.com/joyceetng00/) - we formed __Scrappy Data Solutions__, a (clearly) deeply knowledgable and experienced data science consultancy.  Our mission: to lay the groundwork for establishing a dynamic pricing model for subway advertisements based upon traffic through the station.  

### The Data
Our primary data source was the cumulative bulk turnstile entries in and out of each subway station, provided by the [MTA itself](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).  Each turnstile nominally reports in every four hours - it would not take long for us to find some deviations from that pattern.  As a lifetime cumulative count, each turnstile's count ought only to increase with time.

Insert negative turnstile  
Insert data  
Continue speaking about results.
