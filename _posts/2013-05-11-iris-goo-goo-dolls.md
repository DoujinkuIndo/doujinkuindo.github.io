# Iris — Goo Goo Dolls

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdYWuo9OFAw This song has so much meaning for my crowd, part of the Canon, imbued with summers of lust and hormones, and years more of nostalgia. Could the Dolls themselves have known that their whiny pop song would be a veritable anthem for its unintended audience? I remember a particular dance, the last year, torn between choices — a question of girls in middle school, but moreover torn between homesickness, wanting to go home so badly, and not wanting to go home, not wanting the feeling of homesickness to end. This was a new feeling; not good, not bad, but angsty, distraught, without a root. And there was a girl at home I was thinking of, and there was a girl here at the camp I was thinking of, and I was caught like a mule between, staring up at the rafters of the enormous gymnasium, swaying in the dark, lost in the thought that I could see, through the skylight, the same sky that everyone else did, everywhere in the world — pushing back the notion that it was overtly romantic, ridiculous, thinking it was the same sky she might be looking up at, at the same time.
