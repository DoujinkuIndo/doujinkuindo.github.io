title: Open Source Assistance
---

No real guide updates today, knocked out a Cpk script that I'm pretty happy with at work but need to clean up some things before posting it here. We have some very weird naming conventions so I need to add a bit to it before making it useful for everyone else. For real though, every organization has goofy data structures. This just means that when you make your tools, set them up so that they can be used anywhere. You can then spend your time building the parsers that will format your data the right way and can reuse code everywhere.

On a side note, I signed up to assist with some open source projects that I use a bit, so I imagine I'll be posting some things here about how I approach these problems.

This is a huge first, so expect some epic failures while I try to tackle open issues on GitHub for libraries I use everyday.
