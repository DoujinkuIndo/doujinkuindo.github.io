Idea is to have crypto currencies revolve around the moon with each play/click.

Trouble with uploading images because they were too big.

Solved by generating assets of said .psd files.

All crypto coins are uploading on p5.js web editor

Also made a space background and uploaded to p5.js web editor

Got the crypto currencies to rotate positions based on a switch. No random function implemented.

Updated p5.js with a moon and positions of currencies.

Thinking about changing my project to something more interesting.

Left class thinking of ideas of ways I can change it.

Ended up changing my idea and working on the project all day.

Instead of doing crypto currencies revolving around the moon. I made pictures of an apple being eaten
on photoshop and uploaded the pictures on p5.js.

It took me awhile figureing out how to loop through the pictures with each click. I tried mixtures of 
for loops and switch statements in different functions before I solved my problem. 
Ended up using a switch statement and the value of the expression incremented with each click.


I also found images of an orange being eaten on google and uploaded them on p5.js. Using the same structure
as the apple it was easy to implement the orange switch statement.

By the end of the day, I coded two generative ellipse plates for each fruit (they change size with each click) and 
changed the background color with each run.

My final project ended up being a completley different thing than I first imagined.
