title: Project 1 Changed Idea
---

Ended up changing my idea and working on the project all day.

Instead of doing crypto currencies revolving around the moon. I made pictures of an apple being eaten
on photoshop and uploaded the pictures on p5.js.

It took me awhile figureing out how to loop through the pictures with each click. I tried mixtures of 
for loops and switch statements in different functions before I solved my problem. 
Ended up using a switch statement and the value of the expression incremented with each click.


I also found images of an orange being eaten on google and uploaded them on p5.js. Using the same structure
as the apple it was easy to implement the orange switch statement.

By the end of the day, I coded two generative ellipse plates for each fruit (they change size with each click) and 
changed the background color with each run.

My final project ended up being a completley different thing than I first imagined.
