We're excited to report that the `safetyGraphics` R package is now officially out of Beta! Version 1.0 of the library has been [released on github](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyGraphics/releases) and sent to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/safetyGraphics/index.html)!

As discussed in our [previous post](https://rhoinc.github.io/blog/safetyGraphics-on-CRAN/), `safetyGraphics` makes it easy to create interactive graphics related to clinical trial safety. The new adds 5 new interactive graphics and a detailed help page with both technical and clinical workflows, as shown above. Try out a hosted version of the [shiny app](https://becca-krouse.shinyapps.io/safetyGraphicsApp/) or see the [github page](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyGraphics) for details on running the pacakge locally.

This project is a run by the [Interactive Safety Graphics (ISG) subteam of the ASA Biopharm-DIA Safety Working Group](https://safetygraphics.github.io/), and we're still actively developing the pacakge, so [we'd love to hear from you](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyGraphics/issues/new) if you have any feedback.
