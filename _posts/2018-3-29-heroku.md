title: Creating a Deep Learning Heroku App on a Static Jekyll Site
---

Often times, especially with side projects you're really proud of, a simple blog post isn't enough to showcase a model you've spent months developing. I created one [here](trap-generator.zeager.xyz) for a trap rap lyric generation model. This tutorial will take you through the various steps needed to create your own machine learning Heroku app on a static site like this one (a Jekyll site hosted on Github). 

**Step 1: Train Your Model**
Of course, in order to utilize your model in a web app, you'll need to first train your model. In my case, since I had a neural network *and* a word2vec model, and both of them had to be trained prior to creating the web app.

**Step 2: Set up a Heroku Account and download Heroku CLI**
Head on over to [the heroku site](www.heroku.com) and create a free account. Now, you *may* find that you may need more memory than the free tier depending on the model (I certainly did), but you can upgrade your payment information later if find the free tier apps too slow or unreliable for your use case.  After you create an account, download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI). Then, after you install the CLI, head over to your command line and log in to heroku.
