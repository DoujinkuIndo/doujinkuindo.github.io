title: Corrlated n coins
---
This a problem from Leonard Susskind first Stanford's lecture on statistical mechanincs.
You have a collection of $n$ coins laid out in a row. If you meassure one of them and it is up, then the neighbors
are three quarters to be down. What is the total entropy of such system?

$ H(x_{1}, x_{2}, ......., x_{n}) = H(x_{1}) + H(x_{2}\vert x_{1}) + H(x_{3}\vert x_{1},x_{2}) + .....$
