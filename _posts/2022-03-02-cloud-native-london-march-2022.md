We had four great speakers from Form3, Ermetic, and WSO2 joining us at our March Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Adelina Simion & Andy Kuszyk from Form3 discussing Load Testing with F1 (starting at [29:11](https://youtu.be/-hcHhQKJF3U?t=1751)). They explained that:

* Load testing is a very important component for a well tested platform. It should not be an afterthought.
* Writing tests in Go was a game changer for us. Our teams make use of F1 every day to test our platform.
* This great tool is feature complete and you can make use of it too for testing your asynchronous systems in Go - https://github.com/form3tech-oss/f1

Then we had Arick Goomanovsky from Ermetic who told us how to Improve your Cloud Infrastructure Security with a Maturity Assessment Framework (starting at [58:54](https://youtu.be/-hcHhQKJF3U?t=3534)). His takeaways mentioned that: 

* The Cloud Infrastructure Security Maturity Framework syncs your efforts in effective strides and helps design reachable, practical and clear milestones.
* The Cloud Infrastructure Security Maturity Framework provides a collaborative language between stakeholders.
* The Cloud Infrastructure Security Maturity Framework is not a massive step-by-step document, yet is a lightweight and approachable compass.

Finally we had Sameera Jayasoma from WSO2 who wrapped up our evening with a talk on Cloud Native Application Development with Ballerina (starting at [1:41:09](https://youtu.be/-hcHhQKJF3U?t=6069)). His takeaways talked about: 

* Ballerina is designed to be a pragmatic language with higher-level abstractions to make it easy to develop modern applications that provide and consume services. 
* Explicit error handling, static types, concurrency safety, and familiar syntax make Ballerina programs reliable and maintainable. 
* Network primitives in the languages make it simpler to generate descriptors required to deploy Ballerina programs in cloud platforms such as Kubernetes. 

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
