Description and background of project / task
-->
App links are a powerful mechanism for launching mobile apps to a given state. This technology is very similar to how a website url can be used to launch a website to a specific resource.

All of the ArcGIS field apps have robust support for app link parameters, such as opening an app to a specific map or even creating a new feature at a given location with pre-populated attributes.

This allows field managers to create efficient workflows to improve field operations. It also provides software testers the means to make testing efforts easier.

URLer is an iOS app I created that allows a tester to easily scan a QR code to open a mobile app link. Upon scanning the QR code, the link is saved into a recents list so the tester can easily open the link without having to scan the QR code again. The app also parses the parameters and presents them such that they are easy to read.

After creating hundreds of QR codes to include in internal development issues, I also wanted a tool to make creating and saving QR codes. This led me to develop a macOS version of URLer. With URL for macOS, the tester can easily see what parameters each field app supports and assists in building the links. You can then create QR code that is automatically copied to the clipboard for easy pasting.
