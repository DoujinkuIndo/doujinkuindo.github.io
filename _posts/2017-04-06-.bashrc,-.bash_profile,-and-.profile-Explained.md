title: .bashrc, .bash_profile, and .profile Explained
---

Let's be honest, all the bash profile stuff is confusing. I'm going to try and break it down to make it all a bit more understandable; not only for you, but also for me. Let's look at the files that you'll most likely hear about.

## .bashrc
.bashrc is a shell script that is run whenever an interactive shell is started. An interactive shell is one that the user can interact with. Most terminals are an example of an interactive shell. Typical stuff that you want to put into .bashrc is stuff that you want run every time you start a terminal session. Aliases, for example.

## .bash_profile
.bash_profile is run when you login. Typically, that's where you would put stuff that modifies the PATH (exports for example) because you don't want (or need) that stuff executed multiple times. MacOS does things a bit differently. When you login, it doesn't run this, but it'll run it when you open a terminal instead. So what I do is add the lines `source ~/.bashrc` to .bash_profile, so either way the shell starts, my .bashrc file gets run. Since I don't have to worry about it getting run multiple times (because the login shell doesn't run when I login), I just put the stuff one would normally put here if running Linux in my .bashrc file.

## .profile
.profile is essentially the same as .bash_profile, but will get run by other shells (sh, for example). With bash, if there is a .bash_profile, .profile will be ignored.
