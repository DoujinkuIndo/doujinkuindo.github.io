What is a style guide?

A style guide or style manual is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting of a document. See
[Wikipedia for more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide).

[A List Apart have a style guide](http://www.alistapart.com/contribute/styleguide/) that I think is quite usable, such that I now loosely base our own style guide on it for an internal wiki that contains our procedures.
