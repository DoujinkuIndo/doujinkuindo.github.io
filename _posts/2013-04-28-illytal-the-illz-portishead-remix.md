# ILLYTAL — The ILLZ (Portishead Remix)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHjcaBvJVqQ I thought _The ILLZ_ was a big, famous old rapper that Portishead got a hold of and remixed; some research shows the opposite; _Portishead _is the bigger of the two groups, and Delgis Mustafa, a brilliant young rapper, got a hold of it and chopped it up for his own use. As such, it's brilliant, not a sample but a complete remaster, new content, context and meaning; clever and sharp and lyrically impressive, but gets more credit for fooling me, sounding like an old master whose vocals had been stolen and set to other backgrounds.  Phenomenal.
