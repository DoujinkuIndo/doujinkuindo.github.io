# The Dampening Effects of Mundanity on Horror Fiction: Borges and Calvino Take a Backseat to Back Pains

Borges' _The Gospel According to Mark_ is a horror story. Wikipedia lists it as fantasy. I don't know about that. I read it in a sweat while eating cereal. Not even the mundanity of eating cereal and sitting at a kitchen counter could counteract the atmosphere of this story. This is a very disturbing tale of a young doctor who reads a bit of the Bible to his illiterate backwater cousins, and is crucified by them. This would be very disturbing in the dark, or alone on a train car, or in the park at sunset. This was disturbing in a mundane setting. This speaks to the sheer power of the story, of the writing. I need to do more reading. I do a lot of writing now, but it's not as eloquent as I once was. I should be able to write easily, without stumbling over words and expressions. I read a bit of Italo Calvino's _Invisible Cities_ today in another undignified setting. The poetry was beautiful, and the timeless concepts of city life were positively transcendental. I wish I had better words to express what it did to me. Reading it at the time, I wish I had better words with which to understand the book. I'm a bit rusty. A Nook might help. Maybe being able to read on the subway, anywhere, without weight or fear of damaging the romantic notion of a book might help. Maybe a large and instant library would help. Maybe it's guilty wish fulfillment for people like me, who were once great readers but for whom even the simple hardships of carrying around a large book are too much, and who gave up reading for minimalist bag-packing. That's sad. Reading should be more important to me than that. But I'll try an e-reader anyway. I've heard it can reinvigorate your love of reading. My walls are bookshelves. Maybe I can blame high school for my lack of reading. Maybe I can work reading into my daily schedule at college. That would be lovely, to emerge from a semester not only relaxed and earning high grades but also literate, eloquent, insightful, advanced. These are big words and big goals, but the more it seems I have to painfully and actively strive for them, the harder they become. Maybe I should move in circles, let the goals come to me. How hard could it be to read a bit a day every day? How hard could it be to write?
