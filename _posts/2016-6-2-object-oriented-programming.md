##Object oriented programming
It is programming pattern that is based on the concept of **"objects"** which may contain data in form of attributes and _code_ in form of _procedures_ mostly known as **methods**.It is widely used in some programming languages like _Java,C++ and C#_ because it make programs more understandable and flexible.
Unlike procedural programs,an **OOP** program considers the _object_ in the program, the _functions_  the object has to perfom and the _variables_ that should be associated with it.
##classess and objects
A _class_ is procedure of building an object and hence an _object_ is an instance of a class. This objects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world.
##Inheritance
Object oriented programming is designed using object that interact with each other and by using the concept of _inheritance_,new objects are able to take properties of existing objects hence a class used in the basis inheritance is called a **super class** and the one inheriting its properties known as a **subclass**. Because of this. oop programs requres less code to complete tasks.
##Methods and Variables
A _method_ is a procedure associated with a class. It defines the  behavior of objects created and are designed to handle actual values supplied to the object.
A _variable_ is the data field containing the information used to define objects.They are accessible from any function in the class file. It is not constant and changes depending on the need.
##polymorphism
Its the ability to process _objects_ diffrently depending on _data types or class_. This allows for creation of one function that can apply to all _subclasses_ of the _super class_.
##Method overloading
It is the ability to use one method but overloading it by providing more than one version of the same method but with different outcomes(type or number of arguments passed) depending on the context hence each version having a different outcome.
##Interface
It is a set of rules that allow the enforcment of certain properties on an object. This is  describing what an object can do without describing the exact action and hence each action is left for each particular class.
