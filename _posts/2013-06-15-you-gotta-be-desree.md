# You Gotta Be — Des'ree

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oZXJD1NVW0 PBS Kids used to use this song as one of its interstitial themes — this was a young, impressionable age where good-natured songs about positive family values and self-improvement were magic golden sunshine for a little kid to drink in. And it was great — the song was wholesome and enveloping, something to drown out bad influences and sorrow. For all the hundreds of hours of kids TV I must've watched, this is what I remember — and in detail. It is amazing how these songs stick with us throughout the years. And I do mean years — as many as ten or twelve years, by now — and I remembered the lyrics and the timbre and the voice, clear as day.
