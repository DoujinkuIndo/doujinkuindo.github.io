Back in March of last year I did a [preview of Dragoon](http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/03/kickstarter-previewdragoon/), by Lay Waste Games, for Purple Pawn. Lay Waste had a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign, and a bit over a year later, I have the final product in my hands. The version I received is the Full Metal Mantis. This is the full color, full metal, version of the game available at the $75 pledge level of their campaign.

Eager to dig in, I decided to do an unboxing of the game in photo format.

The game is excellent, and I can't recommend it enough. Lay Waste did an excellent job producing the game with all its excellent bits.
