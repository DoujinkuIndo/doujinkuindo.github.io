## Homework
1. Prep
    1. Go to Tony's [Band Name Generator](https://acidtone.github.io/namor/) and click for a new combination of words until you find a new product that a startup (either yours or a potential client) might think is the "next big thing".
    2. Based on the phrase you've chosen, find one or more [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons (or similar) that you can use to create a quick company/product logo for your startup.
        - Example: [Tony's Browser Therapy Logo](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/sample-code/assets/images/logos/browser-therapy.svg)
    3. Download the SVG versions of your icons so you can import them into Figma for the lesson.
2. Figma

## 1. Cloning a copy of Font Awesome onto your system

## 2. Introduction into the important bits of Figma

## 3. Explore some of the extra design and collaboration tools in Figma

## 4. Open Lab Time
### Scenario
You have a startup company (either yours or a client) that needs a quick and dirty SVG logo for a weekend hackathon. No one on the team is a graphic designer so you decide to create a logo using open source icons and Figma.

## Clean-up Time!
