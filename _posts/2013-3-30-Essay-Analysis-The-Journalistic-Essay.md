title: Essay Analysis: The Journalistic Essay
---

The journalistic essay is like that of any child; it has acquired its characteristics from two distinct parents. These parents are the “literary essay” and “journalistic reporting.”  The journalistic essay reads like a novel, while its content is that of nonfiction.  There were two very important realizations that were made which called for the creation of the journalistic essay: the realization that reporters did not need to coney a calm voice while writing and that the columnist could do their own reporting.

The editorial is an opinionated piece designed to persuade the reader into agreeing with a newspaper’s opinion on an issue.  It is typically left unsigned.  The majority of the editorial is laid out just like a news story regarding an issue.  They then present opinions from the opposing viewpoint and attempt to prove those points inaccurate.  Alan Weintraut says that “editorials are meant to influence public opinion, promote critical thinking, and sometimes cause people to take action on an issue” (Weintraut).

An editorial titled, “Bills of The Rick and Famous,” from The New York Times, is a great example of this.  The editorial is about a bill that a group of celebrities are trying to get passed in Hawaii, which would allow them to sue paparazzi not only for taking pictures of them they did not want, but for the intention of taking a picture of them that they do not want.  The Times held nothing back in its criticism of the bill:

This bill, partly cut-and-pasted from a California anti-paparazzi statute, prohibits taking photos or videos “in a manner that is offensive to a reasonable person,” whatever that means, of someone “engaging in a personal or familial activity,” whatever that is.  A fan can be liable not just for taking a photo but intending to take one, and whether or not the photo appears anywhere. (Times, p. A30)

The piece is a great example of an editorial because it destroys the opposition’s argument–leaving little to no ground for it to stand on.

The ability to make a sound argument is not always easy.  The ability to nullify the opposition’s argument however is even more difficult and a good editorial is able to do this.

Columns, on the other hand, are designed to relay the news but any opinion given is that of the individual columnist.  The columnist has a little more leeway than the average reporter as they are given their own column, whether on a daily or weekly basis, to write virtually whatever they want.  What’s more is that a good column will venture into unknown waters.  Marty Nemko of the San Francisco Chronicle gives a great description of what he writes about and why:

My goal is always to write dangerously, to write about things that are not conventional wisdom.  Why?  Because conventional wisdom has already been, by definition, widely disseminated.  For example, although I am pro-choice, I’ll never write a piece about it because it has been well covered. I want to write about what otherwise would not get written. (Nemko)

This is why Nemko is such a wonderful columnist.  He knows how important it is to explore something new.

The column is an effective form of writing because it can capsulate anything.  While columns in a publication that deals with primarily politics will more than likely deal with politics as well, it doesn’t mean that the writer can’t take an approach that most political writing chooses not to take.

Enter the journalistic essay.  The journalistic essay brings with it different names, like the creative nonfiction or the literary nonfiction.  The journalistic essay is a way to portray a nonfiction report of an event while using elements commonly found in literature.  It commonly incorporates a more natural dialogue than other pieces of news reporting.  Often times, the author will insert themselves into the story as an onlooker or passerby, allowing for a different view of an event that might not typically be available to the editorial or column.

The journalistic essay’s origin is described by Tom Wolfe, in his “The New Journalism” published in New York Magazine, as a story he noticed in Esquire–at least that is when he first noticed it.  Wolfe writes, “The piece didn’t open like an ordinary magazine article at all. It opened with the tone and mood of a short story, with a rather intimate scene; or intimate by the standards of magazine journalism in 1962, in any case” (Wolfe, 1972).

A great example of the journalistic essay is “The Fourth of July” by Audre Lorde.  It tells of a trip that Audre’s school was taking to Washington D.C., but because she was black, she was unable to stay in the hotels.  Wanting Audre to be able to see everything her classmates were going to see, her family decided they would all go together.  On the trip, Audre’s father decides to stop and get them all ice cream because it is so hot out.  The family walks from the hotel down to a Breyer’s ice cream and soda fountain.  In a hushed tone, the lady working at the shop says, “I kin give you take out, but you can’t eat here. Sorry.”  Lorde and her family leave the shop, but she describes it as such:

The waitress was white, and the counter was white, and the ice cream I never ate in Washington D.C., that summer I left childhood was white, and the white heat and the white pavement and the white stone monuments of my first Washington summer made me sick to my stomach for the whole rest of that trip and it wasn’t much of a graduation present at all. (Lorde)

The writing reads like a novel but it isn't a novel.  It is the reporting of events in a way that allows the reader to not only receive the information given, but to perceive in what way it took place.

The journalistic essay is the most important thing to happen not only journalism in the past 75 years, but to literature as well.  It is not something that is easily obtained either. It is the product of hardcore reporting portrayed in eloquent elocution.  It really is the nonfiction novel.
