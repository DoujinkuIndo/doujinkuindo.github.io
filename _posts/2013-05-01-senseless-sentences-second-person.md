# Senseless Sentences — Second Person

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac1zKX3Z2nM I don't like most of the rest of _Chromatography_, but I do like this. I finally found a word for this sort of music — I may have described it as _cohesive_ before, but I think a better phrase for it is _exists in a vacuum_. This music exists in a vacuum. If I don't know the context; if the production is quiet except the essential elements; if the lyrics present a coherent and complete worldview, the music can be said to exist in a vacuum. You can escape into it; it has room for you and all your baggage. It threatens to infringe upon the real world; it can be addictive. This is dangerous music, a complete story with no room for interpretation. It bites down and won't let go.
