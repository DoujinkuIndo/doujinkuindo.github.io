## Terminology
<dl>
  <dt><code>this</code></dt>
  <dd>The <code>this</code> keyword is created (by the Javascript engine) during the Creation Phase of every Execution Context. In other words, <code>this</code> is created for the Global Execution Context of your script plus all functions that are invoked within your code). What <code>this</code> references changes depending on how a function is invoked.</dd>
  <dt>Global Object</dt>
  <dd>An object that always exists in the global scope. The global object's interface depends on the execution context in which the script is running.</dd>
</dl>
