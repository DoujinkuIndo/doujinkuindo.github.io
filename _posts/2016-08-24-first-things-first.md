Welcome to your blog, HUM 380 and COM 601 class! This is gonna be awesome. Before class on Monday, Aug 29, you should

1. Add your info to the [{{ site.baseurl }}/_data/authors.yml](https://github.com/libbyh/methods-f16/tree/master/_data/authors.yml) file - it's ok to use a pseudonym if you'd like, and email and web are optional
2. Add your first blog post under [{{ site.baseurl }}/_posts/](https://github.com/libbyh/methods-f16/tree/master/_posts) in this repo

In your first blog post, you should answer these questions:

- Which research methods do you most want to learn?
- What topics in digital humanities research interest you?
- Which [digital literacies](https://libbyh.github.io/research-methods-in-digital-humanities/#cultural-competencies) do you most want to master?

You are welcome (and encouraged) to dive into using a local development workflow for blogging if you know how, but if those words make no sense to you, that's ok. You can use the GitHub web interface to make your blog post. See the [README.md](https://github.com/libbyh/methods-f16/blob/master/README.md) for more information, especially Step 3. You can look at the source for this post to see what a blog post looks like "under the hood".

Remember, "[Process is the new god.](http://manifesto.humanities.ucla.edu/2009/05/29/the-digital-humanities-manifesto-20/#26)" We are all going to fail a lot while we figure this out.
