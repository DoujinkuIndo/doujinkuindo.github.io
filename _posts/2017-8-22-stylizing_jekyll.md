Jekyll uses Markdown for formating, so all the Markdown commands work in Jekyll.

# Emphasis

*Single asterisk for italics*

**Double asterisk for bold**

***Triple asterisk for bold and italics***

# Headers

The largest header is a single `#`. For subsequently smaller headers, add another `#`

Use a grave accent for `code`

```
Triple grave accent for code
```

You can also use HTML tags. `<b>Bold with HTML</b>` gives you:

<b>Bold with HTML</b>

# Lists
- Dash with a space for an unordered list
