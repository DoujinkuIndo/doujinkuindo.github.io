## Genetic Algorithms Part 3 - Constraint Satisfaction Problems

### Part 3
In part 3, I will demonstrate how to apply a genetic algorithm to solve constraint satisfaction problems by implementing a solution for the n-queens problem. Additionally, I will show how these problems can be solved using traditional methods and compare/contrast the relative utility of the different implementations.
