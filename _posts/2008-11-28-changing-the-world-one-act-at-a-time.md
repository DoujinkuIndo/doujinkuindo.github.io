Do you love your job? I do. Let me tell you why. I get to change 'someones' world on a daily basis. And I love it. 

I do technical support for a
[small marketing firm](http://www.evolutionmarketing.com.au/), all of our clients use ACT!, which is a contact management application. When you show someone how they can improve their productivity, improve their bottom line they get excited, and by extenstion, so do I. 

Just this week we demo'ed a customisation that will totally change the clients ability to track the jobs they do, the items associated with those jobs, the people and all the rest of it. The client was literally getting out of his chair, walking around "of course", "WOW!", "does that mean..." - "yes it does". It was
a the HIGHLIGHT of my week. To have spent the time delving into their business to work out what they do, how they do it so as to figure out what they needed was fun, it was truely enjoyable, but to see the reaction, the excitement, the realisations for what would now be possible - that was GOLD.

I love my job.
