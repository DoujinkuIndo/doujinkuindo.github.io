title: Welcome to AI at UCLA!
---

Welcome to our website! We are the premiere artificial intelligence and machine learning group here at UCLA, and we're a committee under the umbrella organization, [UCLA ACM](http://uclaacm.com).

We hosted our general meeting to kick off the Fall 2017 quarter on October 6th. You can view the meeting's slides [here](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/oH8ECVNQx6H2Qo0)

To stay updated on our events and content, join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uclaacmai/). You can also read our introductory post on what we're all about on [ACM's tech blog](https://medium.com/techatucla/welcome-to-ai-at-ucla-f10927043301). Since we've received a lot of inquiries on how to get started in machine learning and the best resources we know of, we've also [written about that](https://medium.com/techatucla/getting-started-in-machine-learning-c68bdd739c44).
