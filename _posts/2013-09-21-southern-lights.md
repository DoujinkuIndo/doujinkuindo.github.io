# Southern Lights

It was an outcropping at the end of the world. From the nice, insulated ranger station was a large oblong Escherian room, with windowed panels on the walls and ceiling. Out the left wall was a gorgeous sunsoaked vista of the hilltop we were on, with strange-faced penguins staring up at the capsule. Out the far window, sandwiched nicely between the panel dividers was an enormous twister out in the distance, a dirt devil twirling endlessly. To the right was a large brutalist sculpture exhibit, enormous concrete geometric forms, like vertical grids covered in ash. Through a camera lens in the dream, the details allowed themselves to come into focus; the minutae of the dream, such as my inability to get a video without the other touristsâ€™ talking, or the terrible exposure of the camera, or my tripping during a nice panorama shot, convinced me it was real.
