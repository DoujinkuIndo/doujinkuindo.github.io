Just did yet another painless upgrade to WordPress, which is the software that powers this web site.

It is now running version 2.5 quite happily. What made this upgrade different was the fact that I did it from my laptop running Ubuntu 7.10.

Every other upgrade I've done from a Windows platform, using the FTP tool I've been familiar with, FileZilla.

The default install of Ubuntu hasn't installed FileZilla, so it was a quick click to System | Administration | Synaptic Package Manager | Search | "Filezilla" | Mark for install | approve the dependancies | Apply.

In under a minute, FileZilla was installed and my favorite FTP tool was running just like it does on my Windows laptop. Yay! I just love how easy it is to install most things with Ubuntu.
