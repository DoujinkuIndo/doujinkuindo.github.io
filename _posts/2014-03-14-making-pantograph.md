I was inspired by the above video (depicting a set of record players in control of a [pantograph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph)) to derive a closed-form solution for the vector position of the pen in terms of the angles of rotation for each of the arms

##Derivation of nodes \(A\), \(B\), \(P\), \(Q\), and \(M\):

For our pantograph assembly, we define the centers of two circles \(A\) and \(B\), each with a radius \(r_a\) and \(r_b\), respectively. The current positions of nodes \(P\) and \(Q\) are determined by angles \(\theta_a\) and \(\theta_b\).

Taking the position of \(A\) as the origin, we can find:
