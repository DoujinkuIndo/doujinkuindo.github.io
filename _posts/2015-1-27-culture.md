![43 CULTURE](/images/dc43.jpg)

Culture is the perspective by which we understand life itself. It is rooted in our experiences- how we define them and how we let them define us. Culture is us. We make it and shape it as we love it to be. It is what we know, what we believe, and whom we share it with. Culture unites us. The more we know about the cultures of others, the more open-minded, tolerant, and global we become.
