title: How we're using Machine Learning to change the current state of disease detection
---

Diagnosing medical conditions such as sickle cell disease can become much, much faster. 

During my past year at UCLA, I had the opportunity to work as an undergraduate researcher in a biotechnology related lab. The project I was working on with a couple of other undergrads under a postdoc aimed to streamline the process of identifying sickle cell disease through image processing and machine learning. 

### Some background on  Cell Disease
Talk about the background of sickle cell disease here.

# The Current State of Sickle Cell Disease Diagnosis
Talk about the current diagnosis methods here. 

### Why we need to improve it 
Point out the problems with this. 

### Automated Detection Via Blood Image Analysis
We're doing cool stuff. 

### First step: Preprocessing the Data and Feature Selection 
Get da features!

### Unsupervised Machine Learning Using K-means
Clustering is cool, but doesn't provide any labels :(

### Locality Sensitive Hashing 
Hashing into three separate buckets. 

### Bootstrap Aggregation
A machine learning classifier.

### A stateful Recurrent Neural Network 
How we're going to solve this problem


This post will outline the technical details, benefits, and challenges of using machine learning - specifically, neural networks - to detect sickle cells. We'll cover the preprocessing step of applying various filters to extract features of the image, using clustering to detect images of cells clumped together, and then detail how a classifier can be built through the use of these features. Stay tuned!
