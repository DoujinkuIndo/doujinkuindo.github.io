title: How we're using Machine Learning to change the current state of disease detection
---

I've been lucky to get myself involved with some fascinated research going on at UCLA during the 2015-2016 school year.

This post will outline the technical details, benefits, and challenges of using machine learning - specifically, neural networks - to detect sickle cells. We'll cover the preprocessing step of applying various filters to extract features of the image, using clustering to detect images of cells clumped together, and then detail how a classifier can be built through the use of these features. Stay tuned!
