<li>convolution network to ensure some degree of SHIFT, SCALE, DISTORTION invariance use some features: local recepecitve field shared weights or weights replicate spatial or temporal sub-sampling</li>
<li>neural with local perspective field, neurals can extract elementary feature such as oriented edges, end-point and corners.(some other features in other signal like spectrograms)</li>
<li>sub-sampling reduce the precise position, sub sampling down resolution. perform an local average and sub-sampling ** consist of layers convolution layers, sub-sampling layers, full_connect layers, RBF layers ** 60000 free parameters and 384000 connections most parameter is in the full connect layers.</li>
