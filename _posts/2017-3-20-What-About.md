title: What about?
---

So I guess here is where I put what the purpose of my blog is about... The primary reason I made it is to efficiently communicate about things I learn. Maybe if I had a hard time with a topic or something, I'll write a step-by-step of it to help other people like me. I also may occasionally write up a tutorial or how-to guide for tasks that I end up doing quite often. There may also be times where I make a post about a project I'm doing or a friend's project that I think is cool.

An alternate function of this site/blog is to get my work out there. The theme and design will probably change quite a bit as I play around with things or find a better way of doing things. Think of this site as a sandbox... and I'm the toddler (Scary thought, I know).

Basically, expect to find typos and posts about things that I find useful, interesting, cool, or otherwise notable. I'm not aiming for perfection, but an efficient means to communicate my thoughts.

Thanks for reading and have a great day!
