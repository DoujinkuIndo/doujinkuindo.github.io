## Summary

Ames Iowa is a small town 40 minutes north of Des Moines. It is home to Iowa State University, and was named Best College Town in America in 2014.
The University is the center of the town's economy, because o fthe money flowing in to this town the housing prices are higher than one might expect from a twon this size. Also due to it's proximity to Des Moines, it is possible for people to live in Ames and comute to work in Des Moines, further raising the income of the town as a whole. 

## EDA

The distribution of housing prices is skewed to the right.

The quality of each house is given on a scale of 0 to 10. This graph is a histogram of this distribution, the majority of houses are between 5 and 8.

The scatter plot shows the relationship between Selling Price and Over all Quality. There is a generally positive relationship, as the quality of the houses goes up so does the price. Quality is far from predictive however, there are houses in many prices ranges for each quality level. Suggesting that there is varablility in the size and amenities a house has and how well it has been kept up.

## Modeling 

Gradient Boosting Regressor with a lad as the base regressor (least absolute deviation). Gradient Boosting opimized the hyperparameters by building models of the shortcomings of previous mode. The most predictve features of Sale Price were 
- New House
- Paved Driveway
- Finished Garage
- Quality of Kitchen
- Heating
- Finished Basement and Quality
- Foundation
- Exterior Quality
- Overall Quality

This model has a R^2 score of 0.9281 on the test data. 
The scatter shows the predicted scores plotted against the acctual Sale Price of each house. The black line represents where the data points would cluster round in a perfect predictive model.

## Conclusion

The usfulness of this model is somewhat limited becasue of the particulars of Ames' economy and the data availible. This model can be used to predict the final selling price of houses currently on the market and houses of prospective sellers in Ames.
It can also estimate the spproximate values of a Ames house as investment. This model may be able to be used for other college towns that have a large university. 
Weaknesses of model is that it can't be used for many housing markets as already stated, and that is has no information about the starting price or housing market before the final offer. So it is not descriptive of the housing market itself, only the outcome.
