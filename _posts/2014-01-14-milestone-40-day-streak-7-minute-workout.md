40 days in a row of doing the 7 minute workout. Thanks to two simple apps on the iPhone:
[7 Minute Workout Challenge](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/7-minute-workout-challenge/id680170305?mt=8) and
[Lift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lift-daily-motivation/id530911645?mt=8) (or
[via web](https://lift.do/app)).
