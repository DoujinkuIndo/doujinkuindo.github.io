  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To start cloning them so there are a varied amount of aliens to shoot at.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To program the aliens so they are in the right place and work similarly like that real game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>In some ways, I managed to make the aliens however they were not in the right place.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>My game kept doing the wrong thing such as placing the aliens in the wrong place however I kept trying to code it even though I did not manage to fix it.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I sadly did not question at all as the worksheet helped me tremendously and told me what I needed to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked on my own using the worksheet during this task and did not ask for help from my partner or peer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged fully during this task as I really enjoyed programming and seeing what different codes do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have done more extra work on the game and made sure it was better coded as the aliens moved diagonally down instead of straight down when they reached the end of the screen.</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to try doing more code and complete the activities and the sheet quicker so i can improve the game and add more sprites or features.</td>
