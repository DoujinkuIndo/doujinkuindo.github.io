# Ecstasy of Gold (DJ Erb) — Ennio Morricone FT. Nas

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB8xxh7H_hw A wonderful mashup of Nas' [One Mic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCOURZ-yx4E) with Ennio Morricone's [Ecstasy of Gold](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqHsDAnSY), from the soundtrack for _The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly_, mixed by [DJ Erb](http://www.djerb.net/). It gives _One Mic _a proper sense of grandeur it so desperately needs (sorry, whoever thought it would be a good idea to [sample Phil Collins](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/725/Nas-One%20Mic_Phil%20Collins-In%20the%20Air%20Tonight/)), and it gives _Ecstasy of Gold_ a fresh look: a movie I recognize as important but still have never seen, from a genre only now making a second (or is it third?) wave, by a composer whose decades of fame have passed. The idea to create this, let alone the skill involved in actually doing so, is staggering.
