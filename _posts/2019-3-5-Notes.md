| &nbsp; | Gradual Enlightenment | Sudden Enlightenment |
| &nbsp; | _"The body is the Bodhi tree<br/>The mind is like a clear mirror standing<br/>Take care to wipe it all the time<br/>Allow no grain of dust to cling"_ | _"The body is not like a tree<br/>The clear mirror is nowhere standing<br/>Fundamentally not one thing exists,<br/>Where, then, is a grain of dust to cling?"_ |
| Mind-mirror analogy | passive, standing and continuously wiped clean | prajnaparamita at work here (not one thing exists) = true, free, dynamic mirror-play of the mind |
| View | mind is originally pure, but obscured by _klesa_, can be restored in its original purity by meditative effort, high stages of consciousness | ultimate reality lies beyond all categories and concepts, breaking through dualistic thinking leads to Enlightenment, ~objectlessness of the way |
| Meditation | _kanjo_ (jp): "paying attention to purity", _klesa_ are passions, arousal, thoughts that hinder the mind | _kensho_ (jp): "seeing into one's true nature", _klesa_ arise from dualistic thinking, one can/must see through them |
| &nbsp; | Enlightenment is "acquired" by way of practice, they are causally connected | Meditation reveals one's Enlightenment, Enlightenment and practice are identical |
