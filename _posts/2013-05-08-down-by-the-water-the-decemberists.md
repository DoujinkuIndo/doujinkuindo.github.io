# Down By The Water — The Decemberists

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR9DjdMrpHg A departure, unlike anything that came before; this is rustic, more folk, more natural; more produced, yet more realistic. Just as a low-budget home-movie film will seem vintage, personal, and uncomplex, yet a professionally-shot film with color-correction, soundtrack, and makeup can seem more like real life; this album is _not_ vintage, _not _folk, _not_ Americana; yet, it exudes those things. It wants me to think of it as a classic (I do!) and it wants me to know it was there first (it wasn't!). This song is a folk shanty, set in the 1800s (back when they had accordions and, I guess, jangly electric guitars); a riveting tale of a port town with riotous youth; drugs, sex, and rock'n'roll of the literary schools of the Nor'east; it's anachronistic, but charming and perfect.
