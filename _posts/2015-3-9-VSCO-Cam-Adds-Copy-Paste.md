Over the past year or so I’ve found myself doing most of my photo editing in an app called Litely. I find most of its actions are much softer and more true to the photo than other apps. However, VSCO Cam for iOS will always have a spot on my iPhone’s Springboard. Today, VSCO Cam for iOS and Android have been updated to versions 4.1 and 3.2–repsectively. With this update, users are able to copy and paste a series of edits done to one photo, to multiple photos. You can head over to the App Store or Market Place to find the updates.
