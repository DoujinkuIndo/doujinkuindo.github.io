# Heroes and Villains — Beach Boys

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgSgOTxcEMk This is an enigma – the Beach Boys sing about cars, girls, surfing, the beach, cars, girls, the beach, more cars. They have a set, they stick to it, it's perfect. They're a snapshot of culture and history and geography; they'll never _not_ be Cali in the '60s. But there are exceptions — _Pet Sounds_ is a big one. There's a lot more _issues_ on _Pet Sounds. _It's the sound of Brian Wilson dealing with abandonment issues, depression and sorrow and the need to expand his life. And _Heroes and Villains_, not even _on_ Pet Sounds, is the most different. It's about... it's a Gabriel García Márquez novel, about a Carribean town, deserting your family; about seduction and time and mistakes; it invents _baroque pop_ as a genre; it's just different. And I don't know what to make of it, but it's gorgeous and fantastic and layered, and layered and layered and layered.
