So some time ago I wrote [a post about using XPUnlimited questioning it's legality](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/microsoft/is-using-xp-unlimted-legal).

Today I've had another systems engineer tell me that it is legal. So I've spoken with the local distributor ([http://xpunlimited.com.au/](http://xpunlimited.com.au/)) here in Australia and asked them to clarify this.

Part of their reply pointed me to [the FAQ on the XPUnlimited.com](http://www.xpunlimited.com/faq/index.php?action=artikel&cat=6&id=19&artlang=en) site:

>It is legal to use XPUnlimited on top of Windows. If you want to know the details, read the license terms of Windows.

Certainly looking through the links and reading the paragraphs they cite makes me somewhat more comfortable about hearing of people who use it.
