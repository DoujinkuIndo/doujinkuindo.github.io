The mind is always practicing.

Not just when we do meditation, but always.

When we are not mindful, it is practicing _dukkha_.

But we can choose to practice awareness instead.

It's like for workout. Everyday we practice sport. Walking, sitting, running for the bus. This is a sport practice, obviously less beneficial than actually going to the gym (arguably), but any way you look at it, it's a practice of movement with your body. Only, we haven't made a conscious choice to practice it, we just do.
