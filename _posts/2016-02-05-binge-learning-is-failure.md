Good info from Scott Young:

>A great deal of psychological research shows that **studying in a burst is less effective than study sessions spaced out over time**. Blogs naturally embody the latter method, dripping out ideas over weeks and months instead of in a burst.

Bolding mine.

This aligns with what I was listening to on [Tim Ferris's podcast where he talks with Luis von Ahn](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/01/26/luis-von-ahn-duolingo/)Â where Luis says that users of Duolingo get best results with 20-30 minutes per day rather than bingeing.
