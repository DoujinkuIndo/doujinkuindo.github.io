From reading chapter five of Gregory Semenza's *Graduate Study for the Twenty-First Century: How to Build an Academic career in the 
Humanities*, the importance of the "seminar paper" was brought into light. For an individual to pursue a successful occupation within the 
field of Humanities, they must be knowledegable, in the declaration and procedure of publication. 

Learning how to publish is a crucial skill in relation to the success in the field. If one pursuing a career in the Humanities 
managed to evade publications, they can only do so for a limited amount of time: "The facts here are simple: avoiding the realities of 
today's academic market, which demands publication, may make you feel less anxious in graduate school, but you will feel considerably 
more anxious later on if your are unable to land a job because you have not published. Even if you are lucky enough to secure
a position, you may find yourself laboring frantically to do what should have become second nature in order to produce the
publications necessary for tenure." (Semenza, 91). These statements are especially significant because they serve as Semenza's thesis. 
He argues the vital importance of the publication skill in terms of the anxiety one may feel on the route and during their career.
This is important because it teaches the valueable life lesson that if one does not actively engage themselves in learning a skill
at the appropriate (earlier) point in their life, they cannot truly escape it. Sooner or later they will have to commit to the knowledge, 
but acquiring it may prove to be a greater challenge in the future.
