title: Changing Directions
---

For a long time I've never really had a direction on this blog, or any of its previous incarnations. I've decided to change that, and start a focus to these posts. I'll post more details once I lock down some things with a few people, but changes are coming, and hopefully ones that may be a bit more interesting to readers.

Until then, bear with me. Some things may be added. Some removed. Hopefully I'll be able to announce my plans sooner rather than later!
