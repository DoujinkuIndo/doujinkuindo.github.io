title: Week Five
---

Week three of the [Lambda School][1] mini code bootcamp. Looking forward to more complex issues that take a bit of extra brain power to figure out.  At a glance it looks like a deeper dive into functions and calling them.

# Completed Items this week

Day 1: Lesson Nine, [Javascript VI (Callbacks)][5]. Confusing my self for about 20 minutes with callbacks and then spending another 30 minutes on the lesson.

Day 2: Lesson Ten, [Javascript VII (Closure)][6]. This followed what I already assumed happened with JavaScript so the lessons were pretty simple and quick.  I did find a reminder to be careful on my delcarations though. `let cacheObj = [];` is a bit different than `let cacheObj = {};`.

## Continual work/forward plans

- Maybe try out [Lambda School][1]'s Machine Learning Bootcamp?
- Go back to some [FCC][2]?
- Read [Eloquent JavaScript][3]
