So, you may have noticed that yesterday's post was a little bit late; I didn't post it until early this afternoon. That's because I cheated a little bit so that I could get the graph comparing the two [phot_table_y/nbkg.txt](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/tree/master/photometry%20codes/Comparisons_of_methods) files. I had a lot of trouble getting the scatterplot to function correctly. I think it's because when it wrote the data to the text file, it saved it as an nx4 array that confused the `plt.scatter()` command. I tried a couple different ways of changing the data type (changing it to a `list()`, changing it to an nx1 array, etc.) but ended up just circumventing the problem by doing the photometry twice using both methods (subtracting the background before soure detection and detecting sources with the background still in the image) and then plotting the results against each other. This behaved nicely. These should plot exactly along y = x because this change shouldn't effect data I'm actually using from the `DAOStarFinder()` command, but there are some nuances that change the overall result of the photometry slightly.
