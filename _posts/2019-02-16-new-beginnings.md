2018 was a year of learning and shenanigans.

I started and ended a couple blogs, spent way too much (or not enough) time learning Python, went to DEFCON, and overall just totally dived into this nonsense.

2019 has had a very productive start. I've already participated in an open source hackathon for science projects in New York, been selected to produce videos for a popular Python tutorial site, and finally have a nice plan laid out for getting better at the techy things. 

So here we go.
