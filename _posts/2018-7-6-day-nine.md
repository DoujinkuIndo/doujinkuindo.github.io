This morning had a pretty hellish start. Yesterday, I was having some trouble pushing commits to Github from the terminal, but I figured it was were no real problem, but they derailed my work for the entire morning. I keep a folder called "githubstuff" on the desktop that I use as the linked directory for our [NGC6819 github repo](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819). The other day, I added a .fits file to that folder without realizing that it was over 300MB. Github doesn't work for files over 100MB because it would be really resource intensive to use an internet-based service for files that big. I deleted the file from the directory, but it still didn't work when I tried to push even after the deletion. That's because the way Github handles file deletion is to try to push the file in "delete mode" to the repo, and large files still prevent this. Since the terminal wouldn't push the file or the information that it had been deleted, I was trapped in a loop and couldn't push anything to Github at all. I tried a plethora of things to get around this, like adding the .fits file to the .gitiginore, adding something that ignores all files over 80MB to the .gitignore, adding the .fits file to another text file called .git/info/exclude that should also ignore it, downloading a large file service for Github, and a thousand different terminal command combinations and attempts to get that file out of the way. None of them worked. I used Google heavily but never quite found the right words to describe what I was going through; I knew it had something to do with the fact that there was a record of the .fits file's existence if the git directory, but never googled the right words. Eventually googling "github can't push large files" (something that I'd googled using different words a hundred times before this) gave me something on stackexchange that was useful. I found a way to delete all instances of the .fits file in Github's history of changes and could finally push all the things I had been working on to the [repo](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819), which were some results I'd gotten from doing photometry, a version of source_detection.py that was like 30 edits ahead of the one that was on the repo before, an early version of aperture_photometry.py, and some restructuring of the folders I've been over-seeing. Now that this problem is taken care of, I can finally start real work today. 

## Coding
To get my mind right again after being so focused on Github, I started by catching up on reading my colleague's blogs. They're making impressive progress. I'll have to be sure to talk to Rory on Monday and compare our codes -- they're very similar. I started my own coding by making a quick source detection program that utilizes
