Just a quick post of some software that I use, that I've just discussed with Seth (he knows who he is).

- [ClarifyIT](http://www.clarify-it.com/) - Create quick screenshot based documents and email them easily.
- [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) - Markdown text editor.
- [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) - Easiest outliner I've found.
- [Nozbe](http://www.nozbe.com/a-benhamilton) - great GTD task manager.
- [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) - simplify your password management.
- [Timebar](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/timebar/id617829225?mt=12) - focused working... :)
- [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) - macros for everything.
- [BetterSnapTool](http://blog.boastr.net/bettersnaptool/) - setup hot keys to move windows to where you want.
- [Battery Health](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/battery-health/id490192174?mt=12) - keep an eye on your Mac's battery health.

All useful, but the starting point is better task management, so start with [Nozbe](http://www.nozbe.com/a-benhamilton).
