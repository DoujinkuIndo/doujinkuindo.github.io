Human Connection to Nature

Humans are intrinsically interdependent on nature whether we like it or not.

We rely on nature for our most basic needs. From the moment we are born, we begin consuming natures resources. Air, water, and countless other resources are necessary to sustain  our lifestyle.
Any interaction with nature is usually enough to remind us of how we're connected to nature.
This could be something as simple as a nature walk or a hurricane destroying millions of dollars worth of property.

In recent times however, we've grown increasingly disconnected from nature. It's taking increasingly stronger signals to get our attention. Even something as colossal as a hurricane has become more of a norm and we've accepted it as part of our lives.
