## Ernesto is out in the field again!

After a harsh year it is already February! (where did the time flew so fast?) and our labmate Ernesto is on a field trip to control his forest patchs North east of CÃ²rdoba. He will be touring his sample patches and monitoring bird diversity trough points counts and sound determinations. This is the second year of his postdoctoral project and we are we happy for his recently awarded Rufford foundation grant. Have a good birding Ernest!.
