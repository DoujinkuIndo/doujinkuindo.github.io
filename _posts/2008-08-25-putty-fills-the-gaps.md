Yup,
[PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)has saved the day again!

No it hasn't actually filled any gap, but tonight I needed to restart the
named service on a server, not being at my own computer (yes, I actually have a life occasionally), a quick google for PuTTY pointed to it, downloaded and mere seconds later logged in and
service named restart had web URLs resolving once again.
