We had two fantastic speakers from Ondat and VMWare joining us at our December Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Netapp](https://www.netapp.com/), and [Ondat](https://www.ondat.io/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Rodney Karemba from Ondat discussing How to optimize and scale cloud-native application storage (starting at [26:41](https://youtu.be/N2p1JjbFZww?t=1601)). He explained how it would:

* Reduce Costs
* Accelerate Software Delivery
* Better Code Quality

Check out [his blogpost](https://www.ondat.io/blog/3-reasons-to-shift-left-your-data-with-kubernetes-and-ondat) for the details.   

Then we had Dean Lewis from VMWare who wrapped up our evening with a talk on Understanding design, performance and benchmarking of Kubernetes (starting at [57:47](https://youtu.be/N2p1JjbFZww?t=3467)). His takeaways talked about the benefits to: 

* Design
* Performance
* Benchmarking

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
