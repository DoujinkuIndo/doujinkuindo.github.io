title: Talking to the ESP-01 with an FTDI-232
---

A while ago I bought some ESP-01 modules. I'd [read](https://hackaday.com/2014/08/26/new-chip-alert-the-esp8266-wifi-module-its-5/) that the ESP8266 was going to be the next thing, and so I bought a bunch - call it and impulse buy. I intended to try them out in a few Arduino projects I had on the go at the time. Looking at the date on that article, I'm a bit behind the curve, but finishing my Masters, moving down south, and starting a new job put that on hold. It was only when I moved flat last summer that I rediscovered the bunch of ESP-01 modules siting at the bottom of my parts bin. 


For the uninitiated, the ESP8266 is fundamentally a WiFi-serial bridge - hook it up to a microcontroller and you're on the internet. So I hooked one up to an Arduino and some level shifting circuitry, and got it talking. Back in 2014, this was how people were putting these cheap WiFi modules to use. A UART and a set of sparsely documented 'AT' commands.


But it turns out, inside the ESP8266 lies a powerful 32-bit Xtensa microcontroller running at 80 MHz - plenty of juice for the next 'Internet of Things' whatsitmajig. And thats what I'm planning for my stash of ESP-01s. And after 2-years there's plenty of projects out there, and plenty of resources out there.


So to the title of this post - how do we communicate with one? The module runs on 3.3V, and needs a UART. I have a FTDI232 module, which has Vcc selectable between 3.3V and 5V via a jumper.
