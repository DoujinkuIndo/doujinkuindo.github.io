title: Getting started with the ESP-01
---

A while ago I bought some ESP-01 modules. I'd [read](https://hackaday.com/2014/08/26/new-chip-alert-the-esp8266-wifi-module-its-5/) that the ESP8266 was going to be the next thing, and so I bought a bunch - call it and impulse buy. I intended to try them out in a few projects I had on the go at the time. Looking at the date on that article, I'm a bit behind the curve, but finishing my Masters, moving down south, and starting a new job put that on hold. It was only when I moved flat last summer that I rediscovered the bunch of ESP-01 modules sitting at the bottom of my parts bin. 


For the uninitiated, the ESP8266 is fundamentally a WiFi-serial bridge - hook it up to a microcontroller and you're on the internet. Back in 2014, this was how people were putting these cheap WiFi modules to use. A UART and a set of sparsely documented 'AT' commands.


But it turns out, inside the ESP8266 lies a powerful 32-bit Xtensa microcontroller running at 80 MHz - plenty of juice for the next 'Internet of Things' whatsitmajig. And thats what I'm planning for my stash of ESP-01s. After 2-years, there's plenty of projects and resources out there.


So to the title of this post - how do we getting started? The module runs on 3.3V, and needs a UART for communications. I have a FTDI232 USB-to-serial module, which has Vcc selectable between 3.3V and 5V via a jumper. You’ll also need jumper cables - the ESP has a 4×2 connector, so it’s not breadboard friendly - some female ended jumpers will make connecting up a breeze.

You’ll notice there are two buttons in the circuit. One is connected to ‘Reset’ on the ESP. Start a serial monitor with a baud rate of 74880, and you’ll see the ESP’s startup message - something like `blah`. The other button changes the boot mode:

GPIO0 | GPIO2 | Boot Mode          |
:----:|:-----:|:-------------------|
Low   | High  | Serial programming |
High  | High  | Boot from flash    |

So, pressing the GPIO0 button whilst resetting the ESP puts it in serial programming mode - you’ll see a different boot mode on the serial monitor.


Flashing firmware onto the ESP is straight forward, if you have the right tools. The brilliant [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/blob/master/README.md) makes uploading your firmware of choice simple. The Python script can be installed with `pip install esptool`. I downloaded a NodeMCU binary from [nodemcu-build.com](https://nodemcu-build.com), and flashed it with `esptool.py --port /dev/tty.usbserial-A50285BI write_flash -fm dio 0x00000 nodemcu.bin --verify`. 


Open up the serial monitor with 115200 baud, and Reset the ESP in flash mode (don’t press the other button). You should see some garbage - the boot message at the wrong baud rate - followed by some info about your NodeMCU build, and finally a `>` prompt. Type `print(‘Hello world’)`, and you’ll get a reply!


I did have some problems with long wires, and loose connections, but I’m putting that down to cheap jumper wires. Also, the ESP-01s I bought only have a 512kB flash chip, which was not big enough for the NodeMCU firmware I’d built. It’s possible (and quite easy) to upgrade the flash, but that’s for [another post]().


Next up, I’ll get some code onto the ESP, and get online.
