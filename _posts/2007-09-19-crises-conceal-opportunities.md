>Each problem has hidden in it an opportunity so powerful that it literally dwarfs the problem. The greatest success stories were created by people who recognized a problem and turned it into an opportunity. - [Joe Sugarman](http://chris.pirillo.com/)

I was sent this quote Tuesday this week. It is appropriate on many levels, but particularly so with regard to this web site.

You see, my database, which contains all my blog posts since I can't remember when was miraculously destroyed. Along with it's backups. That to me is a CRISIS.

Note to self: paranoia is healthy.

I first began blogging shortly after [Chris Pirillo](http://chris.pirillo.com/) recommended using 'BLOG', a windows app that would do scheduled ftp uploads to a web site. I became a [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.com/) fan, then switched to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). My database contained all my posts from Textpattern and WordPress, and a whole bunch more.

But as the quote (and title) suggest, crises conceal opportunities. The opportunity here is a fresh start. No ties. A new commitment.

So, here begins not a new chapter, but a new book, the old one is no longer in print.
