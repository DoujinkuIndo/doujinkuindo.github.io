First up, Paul described how to [Build, run and manage composite apps on Kubernetes with Cellery](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/14551-build-run-and-manage-composite-apps-on-kubernetes-with-cellery).

* There are significant challenges in managing sets of microservices as they grow beyond a handful. There is a strong need for solutions that help configure and manage aggregates of microservices in Kubernetes.
* Code provides some significant benefits over YAML for configuring Kubernetes and Service Mesh deployment - simpler, easier to read, type validation and compilation, and less is more - half the lines of code means fewer mistakes.
* Having immutable units that have a life through development, build, test, deployment, runtime, monitoring brings significant benefits in consistency, DevOps and human factors, such as team organisation.

Next up, Marc Cluet gave an entertaining talk on [Your Kernel and You - How cgroups make containers possible](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/14629-your-kernel-and-you-how-cgroups-make-containers-possible).

* Cgroups build on top of namespaces
* Cgroups v1 still most used, can be composable
* Cgroups v2 just released 3 years ago, still maturing

Anurag rounded off the evening with [Building an open source Cloud-native Edge Computing infrastructure with the OpenNESS Toolkit for 5G and Industry 4.0.](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/14553-building-an-open-source-cloud-native-edge-computing-infrastructure-with-the-openness-toolkit-for-5g-and-industry-4-0)

* OpenNESS is an open-source toolkit for creating cloud native edge infrastructure and application services for 5G and Industry 4.0
* Open APIs and the source code availability streamlines the platform and application development efforts across the open-source ecosystem
* Links to other toolkits helps create a richer platform at commoditized hardware and software costs.
