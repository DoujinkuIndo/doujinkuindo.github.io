Imagine an environment which is intelligent and aware of surroundings. 
For example, home with IoT can have intelligent lighting mechanism. As a person enters a room, based on the surroundings, the lighting takes care in such a way that, it can light up a room without person's involvement. As a person exits a room, the lighting takes care in such a way that, it can switch off the lights or dim them without person's involvement. This is just a small drop in the ocean of possibilities with IoT.
