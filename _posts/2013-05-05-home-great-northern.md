# Home — Great Northern

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTNf0nkSXdM Another song off iTunes, purchased when I was in 7th grade. I liked the guitar and rhythms; the smooth voice like none I'd ever heard; I liked the switching off between male and female voices; I liked that it was busy and complex and somehow relaxing; it sounded like the immersive sounds I heard in movies. I would ride the bus to camp in the summers and listen to — oh, god, my iPod shuffle, the one like a stick of gum — and find songs that fit whatever we were passing, trying to link up the inside and outside worlds, to enforce order. And this song was that — it was happy, it sounded happy, it was about happy things, yet the tempo and instrumentation, the minor chords: it has malaise, a sort of beat-down sadness to it. And I loved this song.
