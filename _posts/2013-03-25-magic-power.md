# Magic Power — Triumph

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwvikYBN28E I heard this on the radio, in the shower, at 5am. As such, it's _stuck_ in that mindset: before the day's begun, and you're looking around for a reason to get out of bed and continue with your day. And this 80s hair band that sounds like Boston or Journey is singing about relying on music, how music will never let you down, inspirational rock and roll lyrics. It's silly and the video is dated and cute and totally awesome. This music is medicine, it wants to help you get on your feet. Hell, it's about that. [More Than A Feeling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSR6ZzjDZ94) and [Don't Stop Believing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcjzHMhBtf0) are the same. If they were movies, they'd be Die Hard. If they were books, they'd be some old ridiculous adventure novel, like Tarzan. In that link to a live performance of _Don't Stop Believing_, Steve Perry shouts: "Here's some new escape music for ya!"
