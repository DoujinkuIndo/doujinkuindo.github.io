### What is a Logical Statement?
A __logical statement__ is any statement that can be assigned a _true_ or _false_ value. Logical statements are much like human language. They are different because logical statements only have one correct interpretation while human language is much more complex and can have a variety of different interpretations. In other words, logical statement work in absolutes, while human language is nuanced and contains exceptions.

Observe the picture above. The logical statement
`There is a red flower AND a yellow flower.`
has a value of true, because there exists both a red and yellow flower in the image.

However, the statement
`There is a red flower AND a blue flower.`
is a false statement. In order for the statement to be true, both a red flower AND a blue flower must exist in the image.

In the world of computing, logical statements are used to represent digital circuits.
