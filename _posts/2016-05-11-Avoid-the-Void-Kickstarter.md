Sure, I cover plenty of them for [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com), but I generally ended up getting them for free for writing such coverage. I'd like to change that a bit here on A Pawn's Perspective. Ideally I'd like to back a project per month. Something I'm really interested in. Cream of the crop in my opinion and price range.

For May it's [Avoid the Void](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geekfevergames/avoid-the-void-a-board-game-of-chaos-and-survival), a [game I covered](http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/04/pax-east-2016-avoid-the-void-by-geek-fever-games/) from PAX East 2016. A really excellent game that's not getting the funding it rightly deserves. Truthfully, I've seen a lot of crap get funded that has both asked for more, and raised even more than asked. Avoid the Void is a game that's accessible, a good time, and a solid design.

There's a day left in the campaign, and a bit over $5k left to raise to see the game funded. $25 will get you the retail game, which is a pretty great price considering how much board games can go for these days. Impulse buy for sure.
