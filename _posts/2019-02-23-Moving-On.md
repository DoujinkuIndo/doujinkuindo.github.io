## Is it that time?

It is not the type of thing at the forefront of one's thought.

But let's face it: very few people will *not* change jobs in their lives.
Everyone else will eventually move on from a job to something new.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics a salaried worker is [expected to move on every 4 years][1].
Younger generations appear even more mobile.

The grass could be greener on the other side.
Or completely scorched on this side.

In any case you have decided that...

## Yes, it's that time!

You have an offer from another company.
Or you will kill yourself with the mouse cable if you stay for one minute more.

It's time to walk up to your manager's office, slam your hand on the table and say
> I quit! That's it!
And then walk away slamming the door.

Well... not quite!

This might look good on film, but it has no place in real life.

You are a self-respecting professional (hopefully!) and there is a certain standard.
Let's see things at a high level

* Prepare in advance
* Keep in touch with colleagues
* Choose your words carefully


## Let's break things down

### Prepare, prepare, prepare!

Prepare 1-2 weeks 

### ...and then break the news

## After the fact

No counter-offer

Disenfranchized

Work hard to hand-over

Leave at 17:00

## Parting thoughts

As said before, hiring talented people is what can make or break your team or project.

It should never be an afterthought!

Hopefully these articles will prompt you to see the whole hiring process under a new light, remove the pain points
and use the tools readily available to you to improve it.

Happy hiring!
