# Time To Pretend — MGMT

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9dSYgd5Elk This song is about the sort of culture that would produce the comments on this song on YouTube; embracing the falsity of modern American culture; kids who do cocaine and use the term 'trippy' and couldn't bring it upon themselves to be judgmental if their lives depended on it. The 'lax crowd, Cali kids with more money than sense who strike it big and are so grateful they have to tell the world — and, damn them, their music is good, listenable, catchy, influential. An anthem about anthems. False, manufactured nostalgia for last week, let alone last month, creating the impression of a continuous sliding treadmill of growing up and learning and improving and changing, the way life 'should be'; without this feeling, you can't be grown up yet. So the kids in the video make campfires and wear less than normal clothing and parade around in front of greenscreens – but somewhere, there's somebody in the band outfit, perhaps the manager? who is the interface between the real world and the insane luxury world these man-children live in, who can hold in his or her head the doublethink necessary to care about the needs of men whose life's work is a greenscreened music video. But it's all satire, of course.
