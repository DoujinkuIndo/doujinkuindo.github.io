Bonjour tout le monde je suis arrivé à Montréal !!! yea i know little bit of french haha..i'll be learning more :D 

After 25 hours flight from New Delhi, India i finally reached Montreal on 28th August...after that i checked-in hotel and slept like a baby hahah !! no not jetlag i work in the night so i'm used to stay awake...i am a programmer duh ! ahahah so its fine for me .. 
<br>So when i arrived at montreal it was extremely hot and it was beautiful too...the downtown montreal is amazing but a bit noisy haha its the place where party never ends !! Don't forget i have to study ahaha</br>
<br>I checked-in my dorm room on 29th Aug and was very excited to meet new floormates and new people . But unfortunately there was no one on my floor at that time, so i decided to go back to the hotel . As my classes will be in downtown Montreal so i will travel from my residence to downtown Montreal in shuttle bus. Its good i live in a place which is very quite , away from the hassel-bassel city life haha ... and i prefer to keep distance between where i study and where i reside its actually refreshing for me but sometimes too hectic to travel . </br>
<br>After all the registerations and getting settled in my dorm i went to buy my new phone ...yea my first iphone yayayay !!! After that i came to my dorm on 1st September and on 2nd September it was my soccer trials yeah! i didn't got selected for the senior team but the coach told me to play in the junior league first ...yeah typical movie style hahahah..its cool atleast i got to meet new people from all over the world and got a chance to play with them...But i'm waiting for the junior league !! i'll show them who's the real boss is :D hahaha</br>
<br>When i moved to my dorm i made some new friends , they are totally cool !! We have students from different part of world and they all live on my floor...So we have people from USA, UK, Germany, Norway , Pakistan, Argentina , trinidad and tobago ,  China , Canada and i'm from India :D !! Such a diverse environment ....i love it :D</br>
<br>After registering my courses for Master of Applied Computer Science, i came to dorm and went for Barbecue... After that went for my first American Football game ! it was amazing ...okay i admit i didn't understood everything but it was cool...i wont tell the result here ! ahahah...something are better to not discuss hahaha.. Here the food is good...lots of good food joints in downtown Montreal and lots of pubs too...and a very cool Apple inc. showroom too :D </br>
<br>The weather in Montreal is hot and in evening it gets pleasant. In the morning the weather is like 16-19 deg celsius. People in Montreal are cool and friendly ...when i got lost on first day in Montreal they helped me to find my way to the hotel...Most of them speak both French and English...and i also belive its good to be Bilingual so je parle un peu français !!! Here we have lots of churches with beautiful and quaint interior decorations :D  </br>
<br>I went to the old Montreal tour and Mount Royal it was so beautiful... Actually the architecture of Montreal is inspired by European Architecture and its awesome ... i will go to Quebec City in my holidays and might sketch some of the famous buildings which have lots and lots of art work, i will sketch because photography is too mainstream !! hahaha...As in Montreal we have headquaters of many of the top Game Development companies i will try to schedule a tour of Ubisoft Montreal ... i want to take a feel of how game development companies work and hows the environment in the technology area.</br>
<br>Street Art and Music is amazing in Montreal...You can find lots of street art in Montreal and believe me they are really very good...and for music you can find people playing instruments on the streets and they sing too...Heavy MTL is the metal fest which takes place in Montreal and big bands like Lamb of God , Slayer etc plays in the fest its like huge...I belive Montreal is really cool place for artists and musicians !!! Yeah don't forget the cold though ! its very cold here and so i'm planning to buy jacket and shoes for winters ... "Don't save money on winter clothes belive me " this is what guy told me when i asked his advice for Montreal winters :D</br>

<br>Donc, ceci est ma première expérience à Montréal, je vais continuer à explorer plus</br>
