# Fix You — Coldplay

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI-o25K6B-E Twice in the past week have I fixed broken code in the instant of the apex of this song. It's Pareidolia, of course, but it's still odd and funny and deeply satisfying, a rush and release of endorphins from having overcome an hours- or days-long challenge all in an instant, with a soundtrack at your back; really an incredible feeling.
