title: January 2021 rainfall 
---

Jan 2021 was an unusually rainy month. It made the news several times in that month for the weather, and even dropped to [21.1Â°C](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wet-and-thundery-conditions-saturday-next-few-days-nea-mss-13880754). That's pretty cooling weather for Singapore. 

Some other articles here [(1)](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/monsoon-surge-bring-widespread-rain-jan-8-night-through-weekend-temperature-could-dip) [(2)](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/weather-january-february-monsoon-rain-dry-climate-change-mss-nea-14391482).

Just how unusual was it? I've put together a simple RShiny app to make comparisons below, based on NEA rainfall data (through data.gov.sg).
