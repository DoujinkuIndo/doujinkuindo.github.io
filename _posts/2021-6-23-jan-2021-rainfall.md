title: January 2021 rainfall 
---

Jan 2021 was an unusually rainy month. It made the news several times in that month for the weather, and supposedly dropped to [21.1 degrees celsius](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wet-and-thundery-conditions-saturday-next-few-days-nea-mss-13880754). That's pretty cooling weather for Singapore.

Some articles also [linked it to climate change](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/weather-january-february-monsoon-rain-dry-climate-change-mss-nea-14391482).

Just how unusual was it? I've put together a simple RShiny app to make comparisons below, based on NEA rainfall data (through data.gov.sg).
