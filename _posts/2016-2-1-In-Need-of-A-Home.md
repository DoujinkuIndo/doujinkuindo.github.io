title: In Need of A Home
---

Allison and I periodically look online at homes for sale in the neighborhood and surrounding areas. Yesterday, was one of those days.

Typically, most of the homes that Allison and I find for sale are way out of our price range--thanks a lot student loans--but, there was a really nice looking cabin that we both really fell in love with. We won't be buying a house in 2016, but it is reassuring to know that we both want so many of the same things out of life.

The idea of living away from "civilization" has always left me wanting more. However, that all changed last year when we moved to the Pacific Northwest. I love all of the green, old growth which fill the forests and the snow-covered mountains. Isolation isn't such a bad thing after all. In fact, we probably wouldn't have had to wake up to this sight this morning...

Yes, that is where the shed that housed the trash dumpster once stood. The dumpster, now gone (the one pictured is the one for recycling), is missing and the building that housed it in a pile of ash. We heard no commotion, no fire trucks, nor sirens. Perhaps it just burned so long that the rain put it out. Whatever the cause, isolation is looking pretty good today.
