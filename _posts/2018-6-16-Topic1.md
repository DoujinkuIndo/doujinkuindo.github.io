UN Sustainable Development Goals
-Quality Education
	The schools had poor education curriculum and unorganized goals. There were no specific education goals that the schools tried to meet and the curriculum was "confused". This shows a low regard for aboriginal students quality of education.
	Heavy tasks made schoolwork unsustainable. The students were often tasked with doing difficult chores that required manual labor, rendering the students too tired for any further studying.
	This form of schooling is clearly unsustainable since after a few weeks of this, there will be
	almost no possibility of retention of whatever little the students are taught.

Their lack of supervision led to sexual and physical abuse. I had the opportunity to watch the movie "Indian Horse" a few weeks ago and that shows the journey of a boy through a residential school. A lot of what we've spoken about here could be seen in the movie (which is a true story.)
In the movie, the main character is sexually assaulted(repeatedly) as a child by one of the priests that run the schools. There is no need for me to describe why this is unacceptable.

-Reduce Inequality
	Residential schools revolved around the idea that British practices were more modern and
	aboriginal ones were "savage" and uncivilized. This belief of superiority over them was unjustified. However, Canada has and continues to improve.

-Sustainable cities and communities
	Incorporating aboriginal communities in federal decision making
	Allowing them to speak up for what had been done to them
