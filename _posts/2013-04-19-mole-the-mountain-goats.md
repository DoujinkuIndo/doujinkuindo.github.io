# Mole — The Mountain Goats

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW8WJrb0XmY There's  a moment in this song — 1:24, I think, and then strongly at 1:57— where this ghostly, horrid piano comes in, elevating the song from acoustic guitar and voice to acoustic, bass and voice, to, suddenly, this incredible, desolate landscape of — well, it's an aesthetic reaction to a combination of things. I think it's evocative of a large, empty room; of a single, lonesome pianist; its sudden intrusion is like a dam bursting; it is a moment of both great importance — this must be said — and great isolation — only this can be said, I must be louder than the rest — and it breaks my heart. The song is about waking up from a coma, I think, and this one moment has tricked me into listening to the song three, four, five repetitions at a time, and it's just... listening to it now, it's quieter than I remembered. Maybe I wasn't expecting it. These songs are like visual poems; each comes quicker the second and third time, but they have this ethereal quality that resists analysis. I love them so.
