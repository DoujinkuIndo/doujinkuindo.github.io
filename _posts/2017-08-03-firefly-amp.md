title: FireFly Tube Amplifier Part 1

## Building a FireFly Tube Amplifier

I recently built a FireFly Tube Amplifier based off of [Doug Hammond's original design](http://ax84.com/index.php/oldprojects.html?project_id=firefly). 

This will be a multi-part series, as I intend to build an enclosure for the amplifier, as well as a speaker cabinet sometime in the near future. 

I'd like to briefly document the process followed, the tools required, and the issues I ran into. 

**_Disclaimer: This project can be potentially fatal, proceed at your own risk!_** 

Tool recommendations are a blend of quality and affordability. While Greenlee tools are quite nice, their cost can be hard to stomach.

### Components Needed
Due to the nature of the electronic component industry, I've provided several links to various bill of materials for this project. Please take your time to ensure that the parts ordered meet the required specifications. John Calhoun's Bill of Materials is a good starting place for component specifications, although keep in mind that some components may need to be substituted, and components may need to be sourced from other vendors.

Please take heed of the information provided on the RonSound Revision 8 PCB page regarding the chassis, transformers, tubes, sockets, etc.

* **[RonSound Revision 8 PCB](http://ronsound.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=129&products_id=882)**
* **[John Calhoun's FireFly PCB Assembly Guide and Bill of Materials (BOM Page 11)](http://vintageusaguitars.com/misc/Firefly%20PCB%20Guide%208.pdf)**
* **[Mouser Parts List](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=41C1F88452)**

Additionally, you may want to purchase some nuts and washers in order to mount the transformers to the chassis. 

### Build Process
For my build I followed John Calhoun's FireFly PCB Assembly Guide, which is overall a very useful document. However, I did run into a few snags, which I'd like to mention.

#### Hammond 269EX Power Transformer

Please read the manufacturer's notes for your components, as the current production of the Hammond 269EX Power Transformer has different colored wires than is documented in Calhoun's Guide. In Step 19 of Calhoun's Guide, he states "start with the black wires from the power transformer." 

However, the current production has (1) black wire, (1) grey wire, and (1) white wire. This is important to note, because if power is connected to both the black and grey wires, instantaneous destruction of the transformer will result. With the current production of the Hammond 269EX Power Transformer, the White and Gray wires should be used for 115 VAC Input and the White and Black wires should be used for 125 VAC Input. Tape the unused wire.
