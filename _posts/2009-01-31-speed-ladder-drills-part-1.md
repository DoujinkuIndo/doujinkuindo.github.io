Below are some of the basic speed ladder drills that we did this season.Â  I think the speed ladder is a great way to increase your quickness, agility, explosiveness and overall control of your body (coordination).

Coaching Points

  * You should always be on the balls of your feet (your heal should never touch the ground)
  * First get the pattern down so that you are not stepping on the ladder or the rungs
  * As soon as you feel comfortable go as fast as you can to the point where you start messing up occasionally &#8211; really try to push yourself to be as quick as possible
  * Always perform on a giving surface (gym floor, grass, etc) &#8211; never perform on concrete

**Advanced Drills**

(Advanced drills &#8211; notice the quickness, but also how stable the upper body is)
