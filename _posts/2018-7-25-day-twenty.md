After another rough morning with extended car troubles, today began with a meeting with Rory where we discussed our plan for his abscence the next two weeks. Since we aren't yet very sure where the photometry is headed, we decided the most important thing these upcoming weeks will be communication. The blog posts are already very helpful in keeping that up since they're usually very detailed, but we also have other ways of communicating if need be. We're also going to split the workload on the photometry and create HR diagrams since we are both capable of running DOLPHOT, etc. Since I just upgraded my laptop, I decided to try to get DOLPHOT set up on my computer. Even with a newly fast laptop, this took a long time, and I accidentally 6pm slip past while I was working on it. So, I was unable to get back in to the Mac lab. But, I can now push to NGC6819 from my personal laptop, and I installed DOLPHOT and all its packages. Using cygwin, which is awesome, I eventually got DOLPHOT to work and now don't need the Mac lab to do any work anymore. I finished off the day reading about DOLPHOT's output, but won't be able to apply my knowledge until tomorrow, so I'll fill you in then. 

# Conclusion
I'm not much further on the science than I was yesterday, but I'm happy that I'm not chained to the computational lab anymore and can work anywhere. I also feel like Rory and I are prepared to work with each other remotely for the next two weeks.
