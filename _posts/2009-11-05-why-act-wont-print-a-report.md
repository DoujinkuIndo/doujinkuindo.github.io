Often I've been told "my ACT! won't print reports, it doesn't matter which report I select, it won't print".

In the majority of these cases, the fix is actually very quick and simple.

You simply require
**at least one printer installed and have it set to be the default printer**
.

See, that was simple. Unfortunately, people sometimes remove all their printers, or for some reason none of their printers are marked as being the default printer and the first sign of trouble is that when they go to print out a report in ACT! it doesn't work.
