## Break up letter to my product

It's not you, it's me. 

Well... actually it's kind of you.

You need too much love and I don't have enough time.

We started off so hot and heavy, remember Product Hunt, getting above the fold and included in the newsletter. That was awesome!

Or when we were on the front page of Hacker News for like 10 minutes?

We had some great times, but we tried to be too much too quick.

We should have taken it slow and just focused on the basics first, before trying to be everything.
