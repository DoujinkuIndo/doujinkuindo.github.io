# I have watched Computer Architecture course from ETHZ. Here is what I think about it

This is the second post in my improvised series "I learned X and what I think about it". I intentionally cover good learning resources here, as I am convinced that knowing where to learn something is much better than knowing where not to learn something. So, this time we will discuss [Digital Design and Computer Architecture course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJBmIaUneB0&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi_FRrloMa2fUYWPGiZUBQo2) lectured by professor [Onur Mutlu](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/).
