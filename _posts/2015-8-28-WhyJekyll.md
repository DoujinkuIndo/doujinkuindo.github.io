Have you heard of Jekyll?  Officially, Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. In Layman's terms it is a website generator. Jekyll takes raw files such as Markdown and HTML, runs those files through parsers and converters, and then generates a static HTML site. After my first official project developing with WordPress (which you can read about [here](http://dawitelias.github.io/work/globalthinking)), I decided not to use it again unless I had to.

The biggest complaint about WordPress is how clunky and bloated it can be. I had a different problem. In my personal experience, I found WordPress to be too "hacky" to create what I wanted. For example, pagination in WordPress should be done in one specific way. Modeling my pagination in such a way would affect the layout. That is not a compromise I'm willing to make often. Instead, with a little Googling, you can usually find a workaround. However, the more I use WordPress, the more workarounds I had to implement. To be honest, it just becomes a headache. Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing platform capable of creating fantastic sites in the right hands. I guess my hands just aren't the right ones!

Back to Jekyll. It's lightweight, faster, much less "hacky", doesn't use a database, and integrates beautifully with Github Pages. Github essentially becomes your CMS. Because my pages are technically markdown files, I can use Github to create, edit,  and save all without pushing and pulling changes. Jekyll is built on ruby and ships with its own Sass converter. I can write Sass and when I hit "Save" and my static HTML files are built, the Sass is automatically converted to CSS.

It's just so simple. There aren't a lot of use cases for Jekyll outside of creating a blog. Because of this, I created a solution where I didn't see a formal answer. Aside from that, Jekyll has been an absolute joy to use. I highly recommend everyone try it out for their next project!
