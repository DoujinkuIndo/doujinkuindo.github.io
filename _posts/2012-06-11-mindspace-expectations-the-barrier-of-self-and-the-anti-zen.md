# Mindspace: Expectations, the Barrier of Self, and the Anti-Zen

Slowly as much becomes apparent to us as children: that our expectations of the world have increasingly little say over its actual content. So our perceptions and behaviors and recovery methods alterÂ subtly. _I have learned to affect events rather than seek to control them entirely._ I must learn to accept failure completely: my own and those of others. Anger is irrelevant, a distraction. When things fade from my control, as they do, it's okay to be upset. Emotion is always allowed a hand in my life. But I must never let it rule me. Panic and anger may come first, but they can be controlled; not subdued, not silenced, not oppressed. _They can be transformed into creative energies and whisked away._ Humans can do better than our most primal emotions. At a loss, shock is vain and panic is fruitless. _Worse, anger shows a startling disconnect between the inside and outside worlds._ My image of the future will never come entirely true. Hoping, working towards it is encouraged. Expecting it, feeling entitled towards it is not. Rationality helps us see the two paths. There is the zen, where failure and loss and sadness can be dealt with and then put aside in health. _And there is anti-zen, the mindspace of fear and anxiety and hot-blooded anger, and it is an easy pit to stumble into._ Music can simulate it with cacophony. Art and writing use complexity. The real world pulls us towards it with ease. In the coming days I will fall into anti-zen a hundred times. There is always a way out. There is no shame in dealing with your problems, only in pushing them off to be dealt with later.
