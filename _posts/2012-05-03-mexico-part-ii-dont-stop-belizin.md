It turned out five days in Mexico City really isn&#8217;t enough, it&#8217;s way too big to be done thoroughly in that time. That said, given the interesting few days of dealing with a robbery, the dodgy folk at the Hostel and chasing a police report for insurance reasons, I was pretty keen to move on.

I wound up flying straight to Cancun to spend a couple days there soaking up the sun, surf and sand. The water is a brilliant blue and for a time of year that is getting pretty cold in the States and Canada, it was especially warm and inviting.

Cancun itself wasn&#8217;t anything special, I&#8217;d liken it to the Gold Coast. It&#8217;s full of tourists and the beach is lined with hotel after hotel. All in all, not a terrible place, but not the Mexico I was hoping to discover so I considered my options.

Cuba was high on my list but for the length of time I could spend there it was working out way too expensive. Instead I hopped on a bus and headed for Tulum, a small coastal town on the Yucatan Peninsula with some Mayan ruins. The town itself is a fairly unimpressive town with pothole riddled, barely sealed roads. I&#8217;m told the place is beginning to expand and in the past couple of years development has been strong with the increase in tourist dollars to the area.

I believe there are some larger and more impressive ruins locally and slightly further inland, but I made my way to the ones by the sea. On a perfect day such as that, the scenery is incredible, and there&#8217;s loads of interesting wildlife hanging out in the area.

    Still not sure what this thing is. Apparently it&#8217;s related to raccoons, but looked a little like a monkey

Having a chat to some guy at a hostel, he highly recommended San Pedro in Belize, and seeing this as an opportunity to clock up another country I seized it. Exiting immigration in Mexico was pretty funny and quite probably dodgy, with a &#8220;you pay exit fee, go to central bank down the road and pay there&#8230; or you can pay me here and you don&#8217;t need to pay the entry fee when you come back.&#8221; Not dodgy at all.

The Mexican customs guys also take their job pretty seriously, rocking up to the dock, heavily armed with machine guns and sniffer dogs in tow. It&#8217;s pretty intimidating, and I assume that is pretty much the whole point.

A 45 minute speed boat trip later and we arrive at San Pedro, Belize. It&#8217;s the least intimidating customs facility I&#8217;ve ever encountered, quite literally a shack.

  I went into it without much research an assumed I&#8217;d wind up spending a few days just swimming around, eating cheap food and drinking cheap beer. Also I was unprepared for the fact that the place has few locals and a lot of American immigrants. Turns out there wasn&#8217;t much swimming to be had (muddy beaches one side, cayman [or alligator?] infested mangroves on the other), and everything is pretty expensive in comparison with Mexico. Nice place for a couple days, but not the paradise I was hoping for.

I met a colourful chap down at the Burger Shack, a burger joint miles from town I stumbled across while heading off for a walk. I really wish I had taken a photo of the guy, but I was admittedly legit afraid of the dude. Several slashed scars across his face and a rather inhospitable expression on his face, he appeared in the seat next to me from seemingly nowhere.

He introduces himself as &#8220;Tupac,&#8221; all his mates call him that because he loves the artist so much. He rambled on a little bit, then finally asked what drugs I do, because he can hook me up. I politely decline, so he moves on to ask &#8220;so you like b*tches? What do you like? Latino? Blonde? Asian? Whatever you want man, just go to my brother&#8217;s bar and he&#8217;ll get you anything you want.&#8221; I pull out the &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a girlfriend, I&#8217;m fine thanks&#8217; and hope he moves on.

He began to ramble a little more before tapping me on the shoulder and pointing to the waitress walking down the stairs, &#8220;you see her?  That&#8217;s my sister.&#8221; There was a momentary pause, but no hesitation as he made the declaration;

&#8220;I want to f#$& her!&#8221;
