### Apartment Temperature and Humidity using plot.ly and arduino

I really like arduino and I really like plot.ly.  We use plotly at work to provide better interaction with plots in our web apps, and their online workspace is fantastic.

When I saw a tutorial for getting started with arduino and plotly, I had to try it. [Check it out](https://plot.ly/arduino/dht22-temperature-tutorial/)

The code is pretty straightforward, and they now even fill it the relavent credentials for you at the above link!  Clever folks over there at plot.ly.

Here's a link to [my data](https://plot.ly/~rossk/6 "Super Awesome Apartment Data"), and the plot is embedded below.

Give it a try!  It's a lot of fun, and pretty easy.
