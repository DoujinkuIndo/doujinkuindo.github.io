# Hotels comeback to the experience game

The sudden rise of hosting services like Airbnb worked as a wakeup call for the hotelier industry. The tourist didn't need more in-door comfort, but more outdoor experiences.

Arrivedo began with the mission of helping closing the gap between front-desk's local knowledge and the guet's eager need for exploration.

The company already had an iPad app meant to be displayed as a kiosk on a hotel's lobby. My mission was making an iPhone version aimed directly at the guests.

# Tailoring content consumption for the traveling user

Right from the start, we knew the project had some special constraints:

- Minimal footprint, for downloading on overcrowded Wifi connections (like on airports and hotels)
- Reliable offline mode, for users without constant connection while traveling

This context guided all of our decisions, including technical ones. We chose taking further advantage of Firebase (already used on the iPad app) for having always cached content available to read. And we also ended up switching from Google Maps to Mapbox for granular control over offline vector maps.

# Not getting in the way of adventure

Throughout the project we made sure to always remember that, for the user, the trip was the main attraction, not the app. We work hard to keep the product as a helpful companion not screaming for constant attention.

# Featured interactions

The scrolling behavior between the content and the map was certainly the most delicate feature to finess.

Unlike the iPad version, there was no room for having both the reader and the full-fledged map visible at the same time. So I spent a fair ammount of time nailing an elegant transition from showing the article's map with all points of interest, to a taller reader with just the current point of interest visible at any given time.

(Note: I would love to show it, but for business decisions the app is no longer available)
(Note to self: Document your work, it's not that hard)

# Final thoughts

Every project brings you a little closer to understaing people, and this was no exception. The travel business is a vast world with unseen interactions and I was thrilled to know more every step of the way.
