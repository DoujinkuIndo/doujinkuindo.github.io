Privilege gives birth to privilege which more easily gives birth to success.
Academically, white males have taken the most space, been given the most encouragement and systematically excluded all other groups from academic discussions.
This perverse, colonial monopoly over knowledge production affects who academics are and what they research and is especially prevalent in natural science where perceptions of talent and ability play a large psychological role in success.
Clearly having parents who have the time to give encouragement and the confidence to give help is a huge advantage to students.
Equally important could be an education from a resource-heavy school with the attention and encouragement of highly motivated teachers.
Combine that with enough societally chosen success stories from role models who are representative along lines of race, gender and sexuality and it is easy to see why the natural sciences are overwhelmingly white and male and the research they perform is largely eurocentric in context.

One integral part of dismantling this system of exclusion and breaking this academic monopoly is equitable representation in academia. 
Many universities around the world have recognized (finally) the huge importance of equitable representation in the natural sciences.
However, even if many universities try to paint their investment in representation as **charity** to systematically excluded groups this is categorically untrue.

Any scientific researcher will tell you the most important ingredient for innovative research is creative thinking, which in turn is fostered by diverse research groups.
Furthermore, it is clear that being able to see oneself succeeding as a scientist is a deciding factor in a student's ultimate success and that this can be boosted by success stories from relatable role models.
Diversity in natural science has a positive ripple effect throughout the academic institution so I find it disturbing and minimizing to equate equitable representation with charity when, in fact, the university is also gaining.

Also, let's do away with the idea that diverse voices driving innovative academic research is anything new, or a product of rich Western universities.
In order to preserve the god-like supremacy of the "Founding Fathers" of scientific research, we are taught a simplified, whitewashed history, devoid of diverse role models.
Back to statistics, female statisticians and statisticians of color have contributed consistently and thanklessly to the body of academic statistical knowledge, but have unsurprisingly been erased from our collective consciousness.
Lifting their stories, correctly attributing their research and fighting against the monopoly on self-confidence in science currently held by white men is an integral part of decolonizing statistical science.

For this reason, I am currently researching and compiling information on several historically under-recognized female and black and brown statisticians that we can have as collective role models.
I hope that as I research and write more, these biographies will become a stable feature on this blog.

Finally, on a similar note, I look forward to seeing the film [Hidden Figures](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/) about the African American women who worked at NASA performing computations but received no wide-spread recognition until recently.
