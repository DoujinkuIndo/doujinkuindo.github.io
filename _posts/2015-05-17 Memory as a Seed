What if memory acts something like a seed? Instead of remembering experiences in their (near) totality, as some function of all your synapses, what if over time, your brain compresses a memory using some lossy function. Eventually, the memory takes up a super small amount of space, but can only be accessed via priming of very specific instances. Then via that priming, the seed kind of provides a way of generating the entire experience.
