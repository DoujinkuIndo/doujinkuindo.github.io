I hear the Marsh marigolds are blooming.  Time to go investigate and see.

The marsh marigolds are indeed in full bloom! Marsh marigolds grow a long wet, swampy creeks like this spring.

I'm going to take a closer look at the marsh marigold. 

![Marsh marigolds, apparently, have a broad flat leaf a lot like a lily pad, and flowers with 5 to 6 yellow petals.  They grow in clumps, with 20 to 30 thumb sized yellow blossoms and 50 or so leaves in a single clump.](../images/Marsh marigold_Tue_27_Apr_2021_18_53_22_-0500_captioned.jpg)

The prettiest picture, with water, moss, and several clumps of marshmallow goals in full bloom.

As pretty as they are, it is time to return home for supper. On the way I will see many other lovely natural things.

I do not know what these purple and blue flowers are, but they sure look gorgeous.
