I'm a big fan (BIG) of
[Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=2034892&sig=f2fac72b3e7f78d37ff44c3f6dd499c4). I started out using the free service but couple of years ago upgraded to the paid service. How and why do I use it?

Evernote for me is basically my online and offline, on every device I own, digital filing cabinet.

Anything I want to come back to or refer to in the future goes into Evernote. Because it will OCR photo's and PDF's I can search and retrieve anything in a snap.

For example, my mail systems (both Gmail and MS Exchange) have rules set to auto forward all the bills I get into Evernote. When my wife calls and says "Have we paid the phone bill?" or "When did we last pay the phone bill?" I simply open Evernote on whatever device is closest to hand, and do a search. I get a list of all the PDF's, emails, JPG's etc that are in there. (When we pay a bill we take a screenshot and send it to Evernote, it get's OCR'ed and index an is thus findable so so easily). The search in Evernote is great.

This makes me far more productive because it means I know I only need to look in one place to find whatever I want.

Side note: Wouldn't it be great if I could do the same in a 'native' way with things like Act! or SugarCRM (both CRM packages)? (I do but it's a workaround). Bonus, you can tightly integrate Evernote with
[Nozbe](http://www.nozbe.com/a-benhamilton) (Task Management package).
