In this interview with The New Stack, I discuss why it's important to understand the End Users experience of cloud native and how the CNCF Technology Radar can help.

* The Technology Radar, from software consultancy ThoughtWorks, is a widely-consulted set of technology recommendations, issued annually. A major component of the Technology Radar is derived from collaborating with the end-user community and obtaining, among other information, feedback about tools used.

* Similar in format to ThoughtWorks’ Technology Radar, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has created its own guide to cloud native and Kubernetes technologies, also called the Technology Radar.

* In this edition of The New Stack Makers podcast hosted by Alex Williams, founder and publisher of The New Stack, Cheryl Hung, vice president of ecosystem at CNCF, discusses the CNCF Technology Radar’s role in software development today.
