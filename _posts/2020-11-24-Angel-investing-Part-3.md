In the third instalment on angel investing 
I am discussing the business' defensible moat and its delivery mechanisms  

You can find part 1 [here][1] and part 2 [here][2].
 
# Letter I

I stands for Innovation

in [part 1][1] (letter P) we discussed the "What" of the business 
i.e. whether the business is solving a Problem 
if it is creating a Product, improving a Process or creating a Platform  
  
in this section we are considering how innovative the business is 
to differentiate it from the competition 

textbook [definition][3]  
> Innovation is commonly defined as the "carrying out of new combinations" that include "the introduction of new goods, ... 
>new methods of production, ... the opening of new markets, ... the conquest of new sources of supply ... and the 
>carrying out of a new organization of any industry". ... Some common element in the different definitions is a focus on 
>newness, improvement and spread.  

That was a long one!

The key word to note is "Combination" 
of existing 

Key questions to ask

How does it differ from everything else out there?
eventually brand will be the differentiating factor 
until brand is built 

what is the unique selling point of this innovation
benefits 
customer perception and experience




## And a word on invention

It is worth noting that this is different to [invention][4] 
> An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process...  An invention that achieves a completely 
>unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the 
>same field.

something invented than something innovative
https://www.uk-cpi.com/blog/the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation

a true invention is very hard to market 
and have wide adoption in a short-to-medium timeframe

1) creation of new processes around the invention
correct usage, manufacturing processes, economies of scale

2) market recognition and adoption 
If an invention is *not obvious to others skilled in the same field* can the average customer be easily convinced?
Especially true if the invention is intended for the "man on the street" (B2C) 
rather than other businesses (B2B)

This is **not** to say that businesses built around an invention are worthless
It merely highlights that the effort, conviction and dedication required by all stakeholders (founders and investors) 
are potentially much greater   

Let's close this point citing a widely known example: Bitcoin  
When the Satoshi whitepaper was first published in October 2008 
Bitcoin had all the characteristics of an invention 
If Bitcoin had been invented by a commercial enterprise 
It would be impossible to market it as a hard money alternative, let alone true hard money.
This is because it was something completely new 
that fictitious enterprise would have probably gone bankrupt for lack of traction if viewed under a "conservative" lens

Fast forward 12 years later 
because of all the *innovative* products and services built around it (from smart contracts to integration with the main 
financial plumbing to exchanges to custodial solutions) 
an ever growing part of the "market" <sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup> is now embracing it

This is the Who

For some people this is the most important

### Experience

Presentable
Eloquent
Pedigree e.g. Cazoo

### Complementary



### Passion

institutions to the general public.
