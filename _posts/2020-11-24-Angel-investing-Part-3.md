In the third instalment on angel investing, I am discussing the business' defensible moat and its delivery mechanisms.  

You can find part 1 [here][1] and part 2 [here][2].
 
# Letter I

I stands for Innovation.  
In [part 1][1] (letter P) we discussed the "What" of the business. I.e. whether the business is  
* solving a Problem, and  
* creating a Product, improving a Process or creating a Platform.  
  
In this section we are considering how innovative the business is, in order to differentiate it from the competition.  

Let's look at the textbook [definition][3] of innovation    
> Innovation is commonly defined as the "carrying out of new combinations" that include "the introduction of new goods, ... 
> new methods of production, ... the opening of new markets, ... the conquest of new sources of supply ... and the 
> carrying out of a new organization of any industry". ... Some common element in the different definitions is a focus on 
> newness, improvement and spread.  

That was a long one!

The key word to note here is "Combination". Combination of existing technologies, services and processes. To better 
qualify this definition, there are 3 key questions to answer. 

* **How does it differ from everything else out there?**  
In almost all cases, the endgame is for the business brand to become the differentiating factor. Until the brand name is 
built, the business needs to attract customers. How is this product/service tangibly different to every other competitor?  
For example, the first [app-based banks][4] were truly innovative. Using a mobile device alone was a completely different 
approach to the formation of the banking relationship. It also caused a radical rethink of the [banking channels][14] 
model. <sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup> This made them completely different, compared to incumbents.   
With the number of neobanks growing, both in the [personal][5] and [business][6] banking space, the "innovation 
differential" is inevitably becoming smaller and smaller.
     
* **What is the USP of this innovation?**  
This question is a corollary of the above.  
At its core, the innovation probably results in cost savings and a more [profitable operation][2] for the business itself. 
A "loss-making innovation" would sound like a 3-word joke. In the case of neobanks, the "single channel" innovation 
resulted in radically smaller operating costs (no branches, less staff, simpler IT systems).  
But what are the tangible benefits for the customer?  
Is the customer's life made substantially easier? <sup>[2](#footnote_2)</sup> Are there economic benefits and incentives 
for the customer? If the benefits are limited, is there a convincing story or ["higher purpose"][15] that the company 
embodies, which would do the trick?      
Are the incentives and business story enough for the customer to adopt the offering (and also abandon the competitors)? 
Will the customer's perception and experience be superior to other offerings? How will that be?

* **How hard is it to copy the innovation?**  
How complex is the new product/service to create? <sup>[3](#footnote_3)</sup> 
Once launched, how trivial would it be for a competitor to copy and launch?   
Is the differentiating factor the complex application of technology, back-end processes, supplier relations, sleek UI, 
all of the above? Is it by any chance something that is already covered by an existing patent, real or [troll][16]? <sup>[4](#footnote_4)</sup>   
How long would it take someone else to figure things out, implement and successfully launch?


You may have noticed that this section is full of questions and provides few answers. That is because there is no 
prescription for innovation. Instead it is a slightly nebulous concept, sharing many similarities to the [economic moat][7] 
of mature companies.  
I think it is no coincidence that a lot of startups are touting Artificial Intelligence (AI), or blockchain and smart 
contracts as their innovation advantage in their pitch decks. These are equally powerful (when used correctly) as much 
as they are opaque to scrutiny from other stakeholders (if used incorrectly). They are easier to initially claim as 
innovative difference (and harder to actually apply in practice), 

What is truly innovative, purely depends on the particular circumstance and domain of the business. Just like with any 
defense structure - speaking of moats - you cannot prescribe what good innovation is in advance, before it is practically 
applied.  
But, over time, you can kind-of guess a [good moat][8] when you see it.  

## And a word on invention

It is worth noting that innovation is different to invention. Again, going back to the [textbook definition][10]  
> An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process...  An invention that achieves a completely 
> unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the 
> same field.

There is a key difference between [invention and innovation][11]. A true invention is harder to market and achieve wide 
adoption in a short-to-medium timeframe.

This is because of two key reasons:  

* **Creation of new processes**  
We may not realise it, but almost every item around us requires a number of processes built and tailored around it. From 
safety usage guidelines, to manufacturing processes to supply chains and economies of scale. All of these "secondary 
things" are what makes products accessible and profitable.  
A true invention may lack some or all of these from the get-go. 

* **Market recognition and adoption**  
Can the average customer be easily convinced to purchase the invention from day 1? If, according to the definition, an 
invention is *not obvious to others skilled in the same field*, what would it take to "make it obvious" for everyone? 
This is especially true if the invention is intended for the "man on the street" (B2C), rather than other businesses 
(B2B).  
Inventions require more time and customer education to be accepted, than innovations.

These points are **not** to say that businesses built around an invention are worthless. They merely highlight that the 
effort, conviction and dedication required by all stakeholders in invention businesses (founders and investors) are 
potentially much greater.   

Let's drive this argument home with a widely known example: Bitcoin.    
When the [Satoshi whitepaper][12] was first published in October 2008, Bitcoin had all the characteristics of an invention. 
Had Bitcoin been invented by a commercial enterprise, it would be impossible to market it as a hard money alternative, 
let alone true hard money. Other than a small group of digital money enthusiasts, it was something completely new. That 
fictitious enterprise would have [probably gone bankrupt][13] for lack of traction, if viewed under a "conservative" lens.

Fast forward 12 years later.  
An ever growing number of *innovative* products and services are built around Bitcoin and
the blockchain: from smart contracts, to integration with the main financial plumbing, to exchanges and custodial 
solutions. Bitcoin now has firm and exponential traction with a growing part of the "market". <sup>[5](#footnote_5)</sup>

2 aspects here somewhat related

## Distribution

the Where of the business
i.e. where does the business "meet" its customers

online 
keyword bidding 
PPC costs 
affiliate networks

offline  
cold calling, appointments in-person or in trade shows 
if the business depends on customer volumes (i.e. many little customers than a few big ones) 
how is this going to scale 



The third question to answer is "How do I know that I am not throwing money away?"

The importance of offline advertising is thinning over time, as people come to see the real world as a disruption to 
their online activity.  

For specific non-digitally native customer segments (e.g. baby boomers and early GenX'ers)
Offline maybe the only still has value to reach


## Delivery

The How of the business

## Footnotes

1. <a name="footnote_1"></a>No channels to fall back on for redundancy, no ability to "paper over" technology's gaps with 
a visit to the local branch.
2. <a name="footnote_2"></a>This question inevitably takes us back to the identification of a tangible [customer problem][1].
3. <a name="footnote_3"></a>To be clear, I am not talking about complexity of usage. The product could be the most 
complex thing internally, but on the outside it should be [as simple as possible][9].   
4. <a name="footnote_4"></a>If this is indeed the case, it *might* become a problem once the business grows in size and 
becomes successful. The existence (or not) of patents really does not matter in the early stages. Unless, of course, the 
business model is built [around patents][1].  
5. <a name="footnote_5"></a>I am using the word market in the widest possible sense: from companies and government 
institutions to the general public.
