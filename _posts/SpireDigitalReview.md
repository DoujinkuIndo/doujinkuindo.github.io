## Spire Digital Meeting 10 October 2017

October was Arduino month for Spire Digital with members showing what projects they had been working on using their Arduino kits.  

Arduino is an open source computer hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical world.

First up was Chris who showed how he had built a small web server using a Arduino ethernet shield.  This was interesting to delegates since it may offer us a solution to hold data from the nodes we are creating to be part of Chesterfield Things Network

After Chris we had Simon showing us his project.  Simon is keen musician and organ player so had created his own arduino organ in an old organ case.  Using open source software each time a key was pressed the arduino would send a signal to open source software that would play the sound that corresponds to that key.  The advantage of this is that you can download samples from organs and other instruments around the world so from a small set up you can get the resonating notes of a cathedral organ.
