# Communion Cups and Someone's Coat — Iron & Wine

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HND2P_ezkag I wrote an entire passage here, and my internet cut out, and it was lost. But that's what this song is about — the future and the present, making plans and having them come to pass only part of the time; the unpredictability of the future and the discontent of the present. The song dances around you long enough to make eye contact, and then breaks it, whisking away again, never happy in one place. It doesn't remind me of any given place or time, merely of plans I'd made: visions of the past and how we deal with the discontinuities that arise when the future and present don't coincide. And the song is about that: how the past is often beside the point, and the future beyond it.
