# There Is A Mountain — Donovan

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWkGs6MxATc This song is not about sex, it's about Zen philosophy, but I understand the confusion. This song is a koan: a poem or story designed to elicit an instinctual solution to a problem, rather than a rational one. It is not easy to understand, and it is not designed to be understood. The song is a hippie song, about nature and change and the world outside your house. I listened to this on the midnight road trip up to Chicago this winter: it was grooving and it carried on, past the red and orange streetlights at 4am in Eastern Illinois, out in nowhere, and the music filled the entire sky.
