  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I kept working on it and reflected back on the discussion when we were shown how to program the spaceship sprite and the speed of how it moves at. </td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I did not ask any questions as I fully understood our task that we were meant to complete.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked alone as I understood the task and how the teacher showed us what and how to program certain sprites</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on the numerous amount of things we were shown to improve and program the difference characters of my game.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I really was engaged as this was my first realistic and detailed game that I would make therefore I focused on the task we were set</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I should have focused and reflected more on the main spaceship sprite as I had minor problems but to make my game perfect I should have focused  on the more important and significant part of the game (main sprite coding).</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>I need to start concentrating and focusing on the more significant and harder things to code as I struggled slightly on coding and reflecting on the main character of my space invader game.</td>
