# Devil Town-- Tony Lucca (Daniel Johnston cover)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e87NBOLnynw I’m a man of simple pleasures. In my world, there’s almost nothing better than a piece of perfectly scored television. Skins did it a bunch, most notably with Susanna and the Magical Orchestra, High Places, and Diane Cluck. But I don’t think anything will ever beat Friday Night Lights’ use of Devil Town. It’s a cover of a short, plaintive Daniel Johnston acapella tune. Apparently, FNL’s music director tried to get Bright Eyes’ already recognized version, but Bright Eyes didn’t have a place in their heart for a new, low-budget TV show about high school football. (They later recanted, offering up their version for use in one of the final episodes of the show.) So Tony Lucca essentially covered Bright Eyes’ cover. His cover is cleaner than the Bright Eyes version, American in a the way that I imagine city-reared teens think a country high school might be. It’s simple, it’s pure. The snapping at the beginning, and clean-cut dirty of the guitar solo, the easy harmony—it’s all there, and it’s all perfect. When I drove home after my first year of college, I took the long way, driving past the live bait machine and the abandoned sewage plant and finally up through the center of town. As soon as I hit Main Street, I hit this song. I hated where I grew up. But driving down Main Street with my windows open a few days before hitting the open road with the friends I hadn’t managed to make in high school, I realized that I wasn’t angry anymore. I was able to absorb the harmony and have the guitar rip through my chest without being in pain. All I felt was a soft nostalgia and a feeling of coming home, for the first time, as an adult. Devil Town had turned my town from a reality into a memory.
