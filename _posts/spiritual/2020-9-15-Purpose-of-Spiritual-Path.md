![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spiritual-journey.jpg)

We all have this eternal quest within us. We want to know who we really are. Where do we
come from and where do we go. Are we just temporary phenomena that manifests for few 
decades on this planet or are we something more permanent. Why do we suffer ?
Is there something called eternal happiness. We strive and work hard to achieve success. 
But what really is success. How do i know as what i am doing is right wrong ? Is there 
anything called right vs wrong ? Or is it something relative perception. 
  
Does God exist ? What is this universe. How big is it ?
Who created it. why do atoms exist ? how this entire nature comes together to 
create this beautiful yet strange world.
 
If you go back to you childhook, you might have asked all these questions to yourself
or to an adult. As we grow into adult we make peace with these questions. 
We become *practical*. Seldom there are people who make it a mission of their lives to 
live boldly and differently and develop the determination and courage to not accept 
the cliche and start on a journey to find these answer. Without knowing for certain, 
if they will ever get it.

##### Eternal Quest 
Spiritual path can help us know who and what is God. Where have we come from. Where 
are we going to go. It is to answer all questions like what happens to us after death of
our body. It is to know if there is anything called God or not. Purpose of taking 
spiritual path is to get ready to face any challenge to find answers to these questions. 
Why do we exist in first place. What is purpose of our lives. 

##### What is different about this path ? 
One thing that is different about spiritual path is that its something on which you have to 
walk yourself. Its like a going to a destination yourself vs knowing about it second hand. 
Spiritual journey is an experience. And only through
this experience you can know what it is. It cannot be known second hand. 

##### Myths
One biggest challenge to get started on this path is myths, excess of information and rather
i would say excess of wrong information available about this path. 

###### Obstacle 1: Lack of right attitude    
Most people get started on this path with a wrong attitude. Attitude of gaining more power, 
more fame, more money, more worldly success. They become right spot for con-mans. They get 
sucked into their games and sometime lose everything. 
Having right attitude towards taking this path is the first and foremost condition. Right
attitude is attitude of sincerity. You are not looking for more pleasures. You are not 
looking for immediate gratifications. Rather you want to know the ultimate truth. While 
there is immense power in this truth, this power is of different nature than the one man
demands in this world. 


On this path you will also know what is real success. On this path, you will learn to 
discriminate. You will not need to refer or ask anyone if what you are doing is right or 
wrong. You will be able to make your own decisions.


  

There is one thing that is common in all this. That is change. 
And this change is in yourself. This change is towards becoming 
more humble, less selfish, more altrustic person. This is also 
same as soul realization or God realization.
