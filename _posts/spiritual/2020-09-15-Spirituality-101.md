##### Body, Mind and Soul 
While we are all so much concerned about development of our body
and our mind, quite often its neither understood nor explored 
enough to understand and cultivate the most important aspect of 
our being that is soul. 

While you go and do physical workout for developing your body and
mind activities, similarly there should be some simple exercises
to develop and rather realize soul nature of our being. 

##### Why pay attention to Soul ? 
Before i start with how its important to first thing of why. 
Why should you really worry about development and cultivation of
soul ? Well, there are many ways to put it. But a simple way would 
be to question why do we do anything we do. Our behaviour and actions
are alwasy driven to achieve maximum happiness. Cultivation of
soul can really bring close to experience of happiness that is 
actually not found in just being in body and mind consciousness. 

##### So.. What is soul ?
Think of souls as something that is behind your entire being. 
Many people equate soul with energy. Its fine. But really speaking
soul is not even energy. Its something of which energy is made up
of. Your body, mind, energy everything that you think about yourself
is made up of soul. If you think of soul as matter then its the 
clay from which all pots are constructed. There is nothing in your
physical and mental being that does not contain soul particles. 
Soul particles are something that connect everything together in 
your being. Its there in the energy that fuels every particles 
of your body, mind and brain. 

Another characterstic of soul is that its permanent. Its something 
thats not transient. Our bodies are transient. Mind is transient. 
But soul is something to which nothing can happen. Its like matter
can change forms from one form to another form. But what all matter
is constructed from can never change or vanish. 

##### Realizing our soul nature: Purpose of spiritual path
Purpose of chosing any spiritual path or spiritual actions is to 
realize this soul nature of ourselves. Unlike worldly knowledge, 
this may not be a binary effect. Which means its not something that
you don't know today and suddenly you will know tomorrow. its a slow and 
steady progression. As you continue on spiritual activities your
realization about your soul nature will start evolving. And one
day you will be fully conscious of your real nature that is soul. 
This is really true purpose of any spiritual path or even religion 
truly speaking. 

##### There are so many spiritual paths and which path should i choose ?
