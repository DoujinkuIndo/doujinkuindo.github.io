**1. Realize youself as a soul and not this body and this mind** 


**2. Know that all are children of God** 

**3. Have Gratitude towards God and Guru**

**4. Observe and Learn from others**
All the capabilities that this mind has collected have come from grade of God 
and these are purely to serve the purpose of God. If you are able to do something
that can help others then have that gratitude towards God. Have that sincerity
and serve sincerely to those God has counted you for.  

**5. Uplift weak, poor and those who are in need**
