![PI_LED!]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2017-11-11-Raspberry-Pi-Pt1/LED.jpg)

Recently I've started playing around with a Raspberry Pi. The Pi in itself is
just a mini computer and you can't really do anything interesting on it you can't do
on any other PC. 

What makes it interesting though is the Sense Hat Module I got which adds some
interesting hardware interfaces you can use to make it a nice hobby toolkit!

The Sense Hat among a bunch of other input sensors also contains a 8x8 LED and a
4 way Joystick (with a button). These little two sub-modules will be the focus
of this short post.

I will try to cover how I initially setup the PI and what I used to create a
simple interactive interface between the two components.

Basically we will be looking at a way to move a single pixel, the player, on the
LED matrix using the 4 way joystick. Additionally if the "user* clicks on the
button they will be able to get a new random color for the player pixel! Simple!

# Programming language of choice

The Pi can be programmed and interacted with in a bunch of languages with Python
taking the lead in the number of available modules. For a started it might be
the better choice!

I wanted to do something different here and use JavaScript together with Node
and combine that with TypeScript. I've been wanting to get into TypeScript for
some time now and these little experiments proved to be a good way to learn
while doing.

And as we will see Node and NPM turned out to be quite powerful and contained a
lot of modules for interacting with the different hardware elements which was
initially a concern of mine! 

# Setting up the PI for development

There's a lot of articles and materials online on setting up the Pi. Initially I
had to connect a mouse/keyboard monitor to configure the remote workflow but
after setting it up I've been using Remote Desktop on my PC to connect and run
code while using a Shared Drive on the PI on my network as the location for the
code.

I was then able to access and edit the code files with a code editor on my local
PC. Working via the remote can be quite laggy so being able to edit files from a
local editor is a must and makes the experience much more enjoyable.

I will not get into detail about the entire configuration as it's been very
extensively covered. As a reference, this is a series of posts that goes into
setting up a Pi for remote development including Node:

# Setting up TypeScript with Node

First things first! Actually installing TypeScript is done using NPM and I
installed it both globally on the Pi and locally on the project level.

This was done using NPM, so no big surprise there!

After doing that I started researching Node libraries for interacting with the
Sense Hardware. After looking at some examples online and browsing the main NPM
repository I came the [Node Sense
Hat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sense-hat) package.

I also researched and setup a simple NPM start script which compiles and runs
the main typescript file. This both compiles the file using the
typescript compiler and uses the compiled output as the Node input!

The final package.json file: 

``` json
{
  "name": "node_ts",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "NodeTypescriptSetup",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
      "start": "tsc ./src/index.ts && node ./src/index.js"
  },
  "author": "EmirOsmanoski",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^8.0.16",
    "node-sense-hat": "0.0.2",
    "typescript": "^2.4.2"
  }
}
```

## Typescript configuration

Like with most points in this post here is a bunch of articles out there on
configuring TypeScript after you've actually installed it. After short research
turns out the setup was very simple for what I was trying to do.

As it can be seen in the package.json file I had to install typings for Node.

The typing's are configuration files for a given library (or runtime like Node) that provide all the
cool stuff that Typescript is known for: Type Checking, Intellisense and so on!

After installing the Node typing I needed to configure the TypeScript compiler
to basically tell it where it can find the those files among other things:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "typeRoots": [
      "node_modules/@types"
    ],
    "types": [
      "node"
    ]
  }
}
```

Some of the other options that can be seen here are covered in the official
[TypeScript
Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)

# Code

Let's take a look at some code now! We will start by looking at the static
key/value pair classes and utilities we use in the main module and then cover
some of the more involved parts.

## Constants and Configuration

This is where TypeScript starts to shine! The benefits of a typed system and
being able to easily define object oriented structures with all the good stuff
like the static values, private variables and so on.

Reading the specification for the Joystick module we know that the input is
translated into strings based on the direction the stick is pushed (including
downwards which registers as a click).

So it makes sense to define a class containing the values for easier reference:

``` javascript
export class Keys {
    public static Up = "up";
    public static Down = "down";
    public static Left = "left";
    public static Right = "right";
    public static Click = "click";
}
```

And because we have a LED matrix that can output different colors I defined a
Color Utility class, that besides having some constant defined colors provides the
option of generating a random color: 

``` javascript
export class Colors {
    public static White: Array<number> = [255, 255, 255];
    public static Off: Array<number> = [0, 0, 0];

    public GetRandomColor(): Array<number> {
        var color = 
        [
            this.getRandomInRange(0, 255), 
            this.getRandomInRange(0, 255), 
            this.getRandomInRange(0, 255)];
        console.log(color);

        return color;
    }

    private getRandomInRange(min: number, max: number): number {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
    }
}
```

These are our two initial files defined as **keys.ts** and **colorts.ts**.

## Node Application/Module Entry Point

Next we will take a look at the Node entry point. I wanted to make this
as simple as possible and just have a startup class that loads up and
initialized an object that will actually do all the work. 

```javascript
import { LedNavigationController } from './sense/LedNavigationController';

class Startup {
    public static main(): number {
        console.log("Started");
        new LedNavigationController().boot();
        return 0;
    }
}

Startup.main();
```

The above file is defined as **index.ts** and is actually the file which gets
compiled and started using the **npm start** command from the  **package.json**
file we looked at earlier. 

I actually need to do some more research both into Node and TypeScript to figure
out if the above is the best approach to handle the startup! Initially it looked
quite reasonable and it even allowed me to quickly change the "Controller" to
try out different examples.

> The other controller and its functionality can be seen in the code example
> repository which can be found at the end of the post

We will be taking a look at the actual controller doing all the work next! 

## Led Navigation Controller

The Led navigation controller is a relatively bigger file and we will look at
its definition piece by piece to better discuss some of its parts.

### Imports

First let's take a look at how we import and declare are dependencies including
the constants that were defined above: 

``` javascript
var senseLed = require("sense-hat-led");
var senseJoystick = require('sense-joystick');

import { Colors } from '../constants/colors';
import { Keys } from '../constants/keys';
```

Here I actually ran into my first problem when setting this up. The first two
lines are the dependencies on the node module for actually handling the hardware
communication. These two declarations use the **node require** global module to
bring in the dependency. We can do this in the TypeScript file as TypeScript
itself is a superset of regular JavaScript so we can use everything we actually
get with Node for example.

This approach needed to be taken because there are no typings for the Sense Hat
Hardware Modules that would allow us to use them using the TypeScript import.

The second two declarations use the regular typescript import syntax by
referencing the files where we export the **Colors** and **Keys** classes.

### The Controller

The next part is the actual **LedNavigationController** class that
we then import and use in the **index.ts**: 

``` javascript
export class LedNavigationController {
    // reference to our color service
    private colorService = new Colors();

    // the current x and y position of the 'player'
    private x: number = 0;
    private y: number = 0;

    // led matrix configuration
    private readonly xMax: number = 8;
    private readonly yMax: number = 8;

    // reference to the pixel matrix
    private pixelMatrix: Array<Array<number>>;

    // the color for the `player`
    private playerColor: Array<number> = [255, 255, 255];

    // More Code - Including the boot method used in index.tx
    // ....
}
```

We define several private variables for storing the state we need, so we can
track our hardware related inputs and outputs. We also create an instance of the
color service that will provide us with the utilities we need to handle the LED
matrix.

Here once again TypeScript shines by allowing us to declare the types for these
variables. This of course makes it a lot harder for us to make mistakes caused by mistyping.

> Even though the actual hardware interface bits are not written in TypeScript
> we benefit from the type checking. Our code will not allow us to pass in
> alphanumeric characters for the color values for example which potentially
> means a thrown exception from the LED module.

### Utility Method: Reset Matrix

The first method we will look at is the **resetMatrix()** which handles clearing
the colors on the pixelMatrix Arrays used to track the current state of the LED matrix.

Here we treat each LED as a pixel. The value of the pixel is tracked
by an array of three numbers and then the set of all pixels is an array of 64
such arrays.

Reset matrix set's all those values to the Off color which as we saw in the Colors utility is basically [0,0,0]:

``` javascript
private ResetMatrix() {
        this.pixelMatrix = new Array<Array<number>>();

        for (var index = 0; index < this.xMax * this.yMax; index++) {
            this.pixelMatrix.push(Colors.Off);
        }
    }
```

What I like here is how readable and easy it is to do this with TypeScript.
Right off the bat we can have this constant value  called **Off** which at the
same type is also type checked by the compiler and no one can change it to a
number or an object (which is something we can do in just pure JavaScript).

### Utility Method: Set Current Position

Because we store the current State of the LED Matrix as a one dimensional array
we need a way to translate the X, Y position of the "player" pixel into an index in the
array:

``` javascript
 private SetCurrentPosition(x: number, y: number) {
/*
    Given the following array and coordinates [1,1]
    [
        0, 0, 0, 0,
        0, X, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 0, 0,
        0, 0, 0, 0,
    ]

    we need to calcualte the actual position in the one dim array:

    Formula: 
    index = x * yMax + y

    Given xMax = 4 and yMax = 4

    index = 1 * 4 + 1 = 5

    Test Cases:
    [0, 0] = 0;
    [3, 3] = 13;
*/

var index = x * this.xMax + y;
this.pixelMatrix[index] = this.playerColor;
}
```

Pretty straightforward! Note the type declaration on the signature of the method
which is another layer of safety. The access on pixelMatrix
(*pixelMatrix[index]*) is always going to be a number! 

After reviewing the utility methods and internal variables we can look at the
**boot** method that actually handles the entire logic of what we are trying to
do!

### Boot!

``` javascript
public boot() {

// 1. initially rset the matrix 
this.ResetMatrix();

// 2. initially set the current position
this.SetCurrentPosition(this.x, this.y);

// 3. the first hardware call! Push the pixelMatrix to the senseLed
senseLed.setPixels(this.pixelMatrix);

// 4. second hardware call! 
// Register a handler on the joystick press event which gives us the direction. 
senseJoystick.getJoystick()
    .then((joystick: any) => {
        joystick.on('press', (direction: any) => {
            switch (direction) {
                // 5. We use the Keys constant to determine the key 
                // that was pressed and change position accordingly.
                case Keys.Left:
                    this.y--;
                    if (this.y < 0) {
                        this.y = 0;
                    }
                    break;
                case Keys.Right:
                    this.y++;
                    if (this.y > this.yMax - 1) {
                        this.y = this.yMax - 1;
                    }
                    break;
                case Keys.Up:
                    this.x--;
                    if (this.x < 0) {
                        this.x = 0;
                    }
                    break;
                case Keys.Down:
                    this.x++;
                    if (this.x > this.xMax - 1) {
                        this.x = this.xMax - 1
                    }
                    break;
                case Keys.Click:
                    this.playerColor = this.colorService.GetRandomColor();
                    break;
                default:
                    // noop    
                    break;
            }

            // 6. Do some logging

            console.log('Got button press in the direction: ', direction);
            console.log("Current X: " + this.x);
            console.log("Current Y: " + this.y);

            // 7. Reseting the Matrix and player position after handling inputs
            this.ResetMatrix();
            this.SetCurrentPosition(this.x, this.y);

            // 8. Updating the hardware LED state with the
            //    current internal pixelMatrix state
            senseLed.setPixels(this.pixelMatrix);
        });
    });
}
```

Besides the comments which cover most of things there are two things that stand
out:

1. At point 4 getJoystick returns a promised that is resolved when the joystick
   object is ready/initialized. This is handled internally by the Joystick API
   we are using. Once that is ready we can use **.on** exposed by the API to
   register our handler
2. Both at 3 and 8 we are using the LED API to push the state we are tracking
   internally via pixelMatrix to the actual LED matrix on the device.

For reference the full file:

``` javascript
var senseLed = require("sense-hat-led");
var senseJoystick = require('sense-joystick');

import { Colors } from '../constants/colors';
import { Keys } from '../constants/keys';

export class LedNavigationController {
    private colorService = new Colors();

    private x: number = 0;
    private y: number = 0;

    private readonly xMax: number = 8;
    private readonly yMax: number = 8;

    private pixelMatrix: Array<Array<number>>;

    private playerColor: Array<number> = [255, 255, 255];

    private setLed(color: Array<number>) {
        senseLed.clear(color);
    }

    private ResetMatrix() {
        this.pixelMatrix = new Array<Array<number>>();

        for (var index = 0; index < this.xMax * this.yMax; index++) {
            this.pixelMatrix.push(Colors.Off);
        }
    }

    private SetCurrentPosition(x: number, y: number) {
        var index = x * this.xMax + y;
        this.pixelMatrix[index] = this.playerColor;
    }

    public boot() {
        // 1. initially rset the matrix 
        this.ResetMatrix();

        // 2. initially set the current position
        this.SetCurrentPosition(this.x, this.y);

        // 3. the first hardware call! Push the pixelMatrix to the senseLed
        senseLed.setPixels(this.pixelMatrix);

        // 4. second hardware call! 
        // Register a handler on the joystick press 
        // event which gives us the direction. 
        senseJoystick.getJoystick()
            .then((joystick: any) => {
                joystick.on('press', (direction: any) => {
                    switch (direction) {
                        // 5. We use the Keys constant to determine the key 
                        // that was pressed and change position accordingly.
                        case Keys.Left:
                            this.y--;
                            if (this.y < 0) {
                                this.y = 0;
                            }
                            break;
                        case Keys.Right:
                            this.y++;
                            if (this.y > this.yMax - 1) {
                                this.y = this.yMax - 1;
                            }
                            break;
                        case Keys.Up:
                            this.x--;
                            if (this.x < 0) {
                                this.x = 0;
                            }
                            break;
                        case Keys.Down:
                            this.x++;
                            if (this.x > this.xMax - 1) {
                                this.x = this.xMax - 1
                            }
                            break;
                        case Keys.Click:
                            this.playerColor = this.colorService.GetRandomColor();
                            break;

# Summary and Code

Overall this was a fun little experiment and intro to TypeScript. It was also a
good intro to the hardware and to some new parts of the NPM ecosystem.

I've titled this post as Part 1 because I hope to be able to write a short
series of articles capturing my journey into TypeScript and much further down
the line the later versions of Angular. 

My big idea is to build a web interface that should allow multiple users to
somehow edit the colors on the LED matrix and have it update the actual hardware
in real time. And I'm hoping to use the web component in the story to finally
start learning Angular 4, or whatever version is currently latest :)  

Finally, like almost everything else on the blog the code examples
are available at [this repository](https://github.com/emir01/TSNodePi)

Until next time!
