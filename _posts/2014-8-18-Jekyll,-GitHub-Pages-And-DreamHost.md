title: Jekyll, GitHub Pages And DreamHost
---

It took me quite relative little time to get this blog up and running because of the following resources:

1. A huge thank you to [Barry Clark](https://twitter.com/BazNYC)
for [one of his posts](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
at Smashing Magazine this month.

2. [janos' reply](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20479904/set-up-custom-subdomain-for-jekyll-blog-hosted-in-github-pages) was also of great help
to get my configuration under DreamHost right and saved me from some emails with the support department of DreamHost.

After that it is just time to create good content!
