We had four great speakers from RVU, Nirmata, Bloomberg, and Red Kubes joining our April Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Suraj Narwade from RVU discussingHermod: Messenger of Kubernetes Deployments (starting at [23:26](https://youtu.be/zqTDmq_xRAc?t=1406)). He talked about:

* Understanding RVU’s learnings about the deployment status
* How Hermod is helping RVU’s developers to understand errors at the early stages
* Making developers confident about their deployments

Then we had Jim Bugwadia from Nirmata and Sambhav Kothari from Bloomberg who told us about Kubernetes native policy management with Kyverno (starting at [39:37](https://youtu.be/zqTDmq_xRAc?t=2377)). Their takeaways mentioned that: 

* Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. 
* With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. 
* Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources. 
* The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

Finally we had Abhimanyu Selvan from Red Kubes who wrapped up our evening with a talk on Kubernetes security and governance made easy using Otomi (starting at [1:40:50](https://youtu.be/zqTDmq_xRAc?t=6050)). His takeaways talked about: 

* The must-have security policies with sane defaults
* How automation works in tandem with security
* Enabling a security-driven mindset within the organization

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
