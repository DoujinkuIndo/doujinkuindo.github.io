We had three fantastic speakers from Amazon Web Services UK, SUSE, and Overmind joining us at our February Cloud Native London meetup at our new venue, the Just Eat Takeaway offices. We also had virtual attendees joining us via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), [Styra](https://www.styra.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/), and [Prodyna](https://www.prodyna.com/en/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Srivalsan Mannoor from Amazon Web Services UK with a talk about Running Cost & Performance Efficient Analytics Application the Kubernetes way by Leveraging Volcano (starting at [13:50](https://www.youtube.com/live/UTBmXQ50KZU?feature=share&t=830)). He talked about: 

* Benefits of using kubernetes in running Analytics Application
* How to achieve cost efficiency in running data analytics application without compromising on performance
* How to use the computer resources the right way for data processing applications

Next up we had Nelson Batsford from SUSE with a discussion on How SUSE helps you accelerate your Cloud-Native Journey (starting at [45:07](https://www.youtube.com/live/UTBmXQ50KZU?feature=share&t=2707)). His takeaways mentioned: 

* How open-source is integral to Enterprise Kubernetes management
* Kubernetes Management is more than a product (i.e Rancher) - Don't forget container security, Storage and operations
* Deploying Rancher need not be difficult with some of the latest innovations SUSE has listed on the AWS Marketplace

Finally we had Dylan Ratcliffe from Overmind wrapping up our evening with Unknown unknowns and how to know them (starting at [1:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/live/UTBmXQ50KZU?feature=share&t=5320)). His takeaways discussed:

* How your mental model affects your ability to debug systems
* Our mentals models will never cover *everything*, and outages will usually happen in the places that aren't covered
* We need tools to help us build mental models faster

And of course, our usual group photo!
