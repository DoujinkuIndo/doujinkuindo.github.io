# Wade In The Water — Charlie Haden & Hank Jones

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdylMDmDu4U The sublime rattle of jazz, rollicking forth across the decades, part of a chain of recordings and re-recordings, standing apart from the rest of music, endlessly inventive and shamelessly derivative, stealing from slave spirituals and modern fusion and classical notions of composition, giving back to communities and nations, popular with young and old, and living, living, never dying; carrying with it a sense of past, present, and future, full of determination and grit, old-fashioned values with new-fangled sensibilities.
