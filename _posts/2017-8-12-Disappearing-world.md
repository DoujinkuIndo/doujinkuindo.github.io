title: My favourite travel tech stories
---

by Kim Nobay

I like to read old books, including books about travel, fact or fiction. The following books, fact and fiction, may not be directly about tech, but they are all interesting in the context of the technology around at the time.

1. Around the world in 80 days, Jules Verne (fiction). In some ways the ultimate story of how technology impacts travel.  The idea that the 'world has shrunk' is the crux of the story.  Fogg makes a bet that he can circumnavigate the globe in 80 days and the adventure starts, supported by the age of steam, the telegram and the railroad.  No hot air balloon though as I recall.

2. The Kontiki Exbedition, Thor Heyerdal (factual).  Simply one of my favourite books of all time.  Not so much about the technology at the time that it was written, but the technology of a much earlier time.  Heyerdal, an anthropologist, set out to prove that the polynesians had the technology to cross the pacific from south america, a theory rejected until then because it was established that the early polynesians only had rafts, not boats.

I'll finish this another day.
