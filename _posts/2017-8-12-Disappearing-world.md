title: My favourite travel tech stories
---

Kim Nobay (Tourtuss Co-founder)

I like to read old books, including books about travel. The following may not be directly about tech, but they are all have an interesting historical technology perspective.

1. Around the world in 80 days, Jules Verne (fiction). The ultimate story of how technology impacts travel.  Fogg bets that he can circumnavigate the globe in 80 days and the adventure starts.  Of course he wins, with help of Victorian engineering, steamboats, telegram communication and the railroad.  No hot air balloons though as I recall.

2. The Kontiki Exbedition, Thor Heyerdal (factual).  Simply one of my favourite books of all time.  Heyerdal, a Norwegian anthropologist, set out to prove that ancient Polynesians had sufficient technology to cross the pacific from South America. With no seamanship skills, and just a balsa wood raft made by Thor and his friends, their epic three month crossing redefined anthropologists understanding of human migration, and made Heyerdal surely the coolest academic of the 20th century.

I'll finish this another day.
