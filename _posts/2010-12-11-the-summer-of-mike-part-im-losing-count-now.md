Just booked flights to China for the end of April. Planning on a pretty kick ass trip with Damien, Dave and Anna, starting in China to skate through the Great Wall like some kind of Tony Hawk / David Copperfield hybrid, take on an army of clay soldiers, and then to Mongolia, which my main knowledge of comes from South Park telling me they have warriors consistently trying to burn down city walls with sweet & sour sauce. Sounds destructalicious.

From there, it&#8217;s a 4 day trip on the vodka train to Moscow, followed by crossing the arctic circle somewhere in far north Finland, down to Latvia, gawking at environmental tragedies in the Ukraine, and probably Italy, Egypt, Morocco and France before I toddle off to the UK for Glastonbury.

Cannot wait!
