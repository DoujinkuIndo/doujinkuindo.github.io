A while ago I had [written about](http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/02/connecticut-festival-of-indie-games/) the start of a new convetion in Connecticut, the [Connecticut Festival of Indie Games](http://ct-fig.com). The convention, hosted at [Elm City Games](https://www.facebook.com/ElmCityGames/) in New Haven, is taking place on [International Tabletop Day](http://geekandsundry.com/table-top-day/) and will feature independant game designers from all over New England.

Not only will I be there covering the show for [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com), but I'll be there as a judge as well. The "Figgies Awards" will be give out for Best 1st Impression, Best Artwork, Most Innovative, Most Sprit, and Best in Show. The winners recieve some cool perks, as well as being able to use the Figgies Award badge on their game box, etc...

It's shaping up to be a great event, and I'm looking forward to playing all sorts of new game. If you're going, don't be afraid to hit me up for a game if you see me!
