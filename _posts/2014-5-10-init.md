Welcome to the brand new House Of Sturgeon DevLog!

As our first game Nubbles is nearing completion, we thought we'd write a little bit about some of the technology we used to make it.

We've built Nubbles using libgdx, a cross platform game development framework using Java. Java may be very much maligned and misunderstood, but this mostly stems from the JEE world where bloated frameworks and dependency hell prevent any kind of rapid development. Away from the Enterprise stacks it's a mature language with a stable set of tooling and great IDE support. Libgdx allows for a nice workflow, developing and testing on the desktop, and then deploying to a device to check everything's working okay.
