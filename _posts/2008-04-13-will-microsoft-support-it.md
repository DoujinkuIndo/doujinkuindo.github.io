Ever wondered when support for a Microsoft product will end? For example, ever wonder when support for Windows 2000 Professional will end?

Wonder no more, because from this link, [support.microsoft.com/gp/lifeselect](http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifeselect) you can drill down to your product, and see if it still has mainstream support, extended support or none at all.
