# The End of the Rainbow-- Richard & Linda Thompson

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRwc_1sILkQ I would not recommend listening to this song. Seriously. Or, okay, listen to it once, but that’s it. I’ve only listened to it four or five times in my life, and it’s off one of my favorite albums of all time (I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight). This song isn’t sad, or glum, or struggling. It’s completely hopeless. In my entire life of consuming books and plays and TV and movies and music of all sorts, I have never come across anything this devoid of hope. It’s hard to describe in words how horrifying it is, especially because it’s so damn simple. It doesn’t play any games with you. It barely has any metaphor or imagery. It’s just a short description of what to expect from life. I’ve hit the point with this song where I listen to the part before the words come in and then skip it. If you do wind up listening to it, do it alone and in headphones, but then make sure you go for a run or something afterwards. The opening chord is really kinda perfect though so whatever. I saw [Richard and Linda Thompson’s kid] Teddy Thompson do a concert a few weeks ago and I’m like seventy per cent sure he was performing high, which really bugged me until I remembered that he was raised by the people who wrote this song. Then I was just happy that he wasn’t curled up crying in a corner.
