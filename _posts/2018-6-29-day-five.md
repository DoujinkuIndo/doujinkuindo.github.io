The day started with a meeting with Dr. G, and I clarified some of what I need to do to be successful with photometry. This code doesn't do everything I need to fully do photometry, but it's still very useful and does the groundwork for preparing the data for photometry. After this code is fully working, I should be able to accurately detect sources in an .fits file and subtract the background flux from the files. I still need to figure out how to convert the data from magnitude to counts and how to make a color map. Although, I won't be able to make good color maps until I get the astrometry data from Marta since I won't know what detections in different spectra are coming from the same source until I get the astrometry. 

# Photometry
I'm tempted to go back to the code and try to figure it out, but I'm actually going to first just read up on a few photometry things. I don't think I can get a good understanding of how to write the last part of the code until I better understand the process of subtracting the background flux from an image. 

The first resource I decided to look at was the [_Python for Astronomers_](https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf)  textbook. After reading the table of conetents, Chapters 2 and 6 seem like the most useful to me. There's a companion tutorial page that also seems to have a few useful exercises that I'll try to do today.
