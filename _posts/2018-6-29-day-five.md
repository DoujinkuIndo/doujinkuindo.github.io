The day started with a meeting with Dr. G, and I clarified some of what I need to do to be successful with photometry. This code doesn't do everything I need to fully do photometry, but it's still very useful and does the groundwork for preparing the data for photometry. After this code is fully working, I should be able to accurately detect sources in an .fits file and subtract the background flux from the files. I still need to figure out how to convert the data from magnitude to counts.
