The day started with a meeting with Dr. G, and I clarified some of what I need to do to be successful with photometry. The [code](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/photometry%20practice/photometry_practice_updated.py) I've been working witth doesn't do everything I need to fully do photometry, but it's still very useful and does the groundwork in preparing the data for photometry. After this code is fully working, I should be able to accurately detect sources in an .fits file and subtract the background flux from the files. I still need to figure out how to convert the data from magnitude to counts and how to make a color map. Although, I won't be able to make good color maps until I get the astrometry data from Marta since I won't know what detections in different spectra are coming from the same source until I get the astrometry. 

# Photometry
I'm tempted to go back to the code and try to figure it out, but I'm actually going to first just read up on a few photometry things. I don't think I can get a good understanding of how to write the last part of the code until I better understand the process of subtracting the background flux from an image. 

The first resource I decided to look at was the [_Python for Astronomers_](https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf)  textbook. After reading the table of conetents, Chapters 2 and 6 seem like the most useful to me. I also found a useful [resource](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) online about photutils, our main photometric tool. 

### [_Python for Astronomers_](https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf)
After reading reading chapter 2, I feel more comfortable with the basics of Python. I've mostly learned Python through using it, either this week or during one astrophysics course, so have a bit of an intuitive understanding of how some of Python works and a keen googling ability but never had it explicitly exaplined to me. So, reading this somewhat basic textbook actually makes some things I've already learned make much more sense and think that I might be able to generate code a little bit faster now. 

### [Photutils Reference Material](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
The main use of this page is that it lists all the functions contained in photutils and describes what they're used for, what arguments they take, and some sample code that demonstrates the proper syntax to make the function work properly. I've looked at a few of the [user documentation pages](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#user-documentation) that reference some of the functions I've already used in the code, like [aperture photometry](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/aperture.html) and [source detection](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/detection.html), as well as the "Getting Started with Photutils" [page](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html). These have helped immensely in getting the code up and running and will be a much referenced resource going forward. 

# Conclusion
The main thing I have to do know is continue learning about what astronomers do when they use photometry to determine the nature of an electromagnetically radiative source. What I've done with coding so far seems like its mostly readying the data for photometry rather than doing the photometry, so this next week I think will be mostly dedicated to learning the theoretical to the science I'm doing.
