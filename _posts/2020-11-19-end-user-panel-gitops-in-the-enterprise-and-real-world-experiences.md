This panel brings together engineers from the CNCF End User Community to provide their insights on the journey their respective companies have undergone in their transformation to Cloud Native.

Each End User member company will discuss their Cloud Native principles and what has worked along with what has not worked. Topics will include operating GITOPS in real world practice, developer experience (CI & CD), CNCF projects evaluated and implemented, and vendor management along with the lessons learned along the journey.

Panellists:
* Fabio Giannetti, Mastercard
* Matt Young, EverQuote Inc.
* Amr Abdelhalem, Fidelity Investments

Hosted by myself as the lead for the [CNCF End User Community](https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-community/).
