Back when I worked exclusively on a Windows machine, I loved using
[Screenpresso](http://www.screenpresso.com/) for the ease with which it allowed me to do screenshots and screencasts (if you're still stuck on Windows, go buy it, it's worth it).

But now that I'm on a Mac, what to do?

So to start with just press
**SHIFT**
-
**CMD**
-
**4**
 and you can take a screen shot. It's a native Mac thing.

If you have
[Dropbox](https://db.tt/Banmhm2) installed go to
**Preferences**
 |
**Import**
 and tick the
**Share screenshots using Dropbox**
 option.

If you want to do screencasts, then fire up QuickTime Player (
**CMD**
-
**SPACE**
 |
**Quicktime â†©**
) then press
**CTRL**
-
**CMD**
-
**N**
 to start video recording.

That's how easy it is on a Mac.
