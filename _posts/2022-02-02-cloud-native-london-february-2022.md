This month, we were showcasing a single fantastic speaker from Ondat at our February Cloud Native London virtual meetup, with attendees via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams.

We are immensely grateful to [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

This month we had Nic Vermandé from Ondat telling us about DevOps Gone Wild! Implementing Policy-As-Code with Kubernetes (starting at [36:08](https://youtu.be/LFxx0Hz9xAU?t=2168)). He explained that:

* DevOps at scale inherits the same risks as automation at scale, Kubernetes Operators provide more automation for operations but can introduce a sprawl of custom resources
* GitOps helps reduce manual interactions with the cluster, hence increasing security and improving compliance
* Policy-as-Code enforces best practices and compliance rules before workloads are deployed in the cluster at every stage of the application lifecycle

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
