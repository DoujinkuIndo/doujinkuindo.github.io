title: Expired SSL certificate (update)
---

We have good news. Roland is back from Saudi Arabia. His new company [desertbit](http://desertbit.com/) will fly soon. This will bring also a new CMS for manjaro.org. We will soon replace our current broken webserver holding our forums, wiki and mailing list and merge to a new one. We also plan to provide a packaging service for packages and iso-images.

Regarding the expired SSL certificate. Roland got a reminder on **Mon, 23 Mar 2015 18:14:37 +0900 (JST)** from **GlobalSign**. He also replied in time for extension. Sadly we got no response from GlobalSign back.

Therefor we hold a meeting with some of our core members to decide what to do. Result: we bought a 2 Year Hetzner SSL certificate from your [donations]({{ site.baseurl }}/donate). We thank all our community members who made that happen. Also these donations will finance us for another half year.

Expect the current page run again by Wednesday.

Kind regards,

Philip MÃ¼ller, Manjaro Development Team
