# Don't Break the Chain: Fjords, Couches, CSS Selectors, and Theses.

A full month. Thirty days of writing. I'm reasonably proud. But that's thirty days of chain. Don't let today be the day you break the chain. After Saltz today, a couple folks and I hung out in one of the volunteer offices. Couches, A/C, private bathroom. Just talking. Getting to know each other. Brilliant, calm, and really unexpectedly fun. That sort of thing just doesn't happen, in my experience. But it did, and I walked home with one of the kids who was going nearby. Just... really great people. More on that story as it develops. I'm now officially webmaster of two other Wordpresses: <http://fjordtofjord.wordpress.com/> and [http://laynalouwho.wordpress.com/](http://fjordtofjord.wordpress.com/), both the travelogs of my friends travelling to Iceland and India, respectively. So that's something I'll have to take care of. Spent most of the evening coding, if you can call CSS hover/transform/animate effects coding. I do. Although maybe it's more like scripting, or tinkering, or tweaking. No iteration, no variables. It's certainly design. Don't really have a thesis to tie the day together. Maybe I like it that way. No big differences these days. Now it's all smiles and business.
