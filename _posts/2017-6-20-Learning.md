title: Know What to Learn
---

Taking a minute from my studies of "The Web Developer Bootcamp" with Colt Stele to write about a few thoughts I had while watching lecture 69. This is in section 7 and Colt is going over Bootstrap.

At the start, Colt talks about how many students feel a bit overwhelmed when learning Bootstrap and how they may feel obligated to learn every part of Bootstrap, or that there are so many elements to Bootstrap, that they will never learn all of it. He then informs the listener that even he doesn't have the entire Bootstrap documentation memorized. He just has it open in the background and references anything he may need.

I started thinking, a web developer is similar to a carpenter. He constructs buildings with the tools that he has. If he needs to cut wood, he uses a saw. If he needs to connect two pieces of wood to make a frame,  he may use a hammer and nails. For developers, our tools are not much different. Less physical and more virtual. Bootstrap is a tool, the documentation Bootstrap provides us is a tool for that tool. While thinking this, I feel less pressure to learn as much as I can about a particular tool, because I have another tool to teach me about that tool, or how to operate that tool.

I can imagine that almost all beginners who are learning these tools get too caught up on learning every element within that tool. I know I did when I first started my coding journey. I think it's great when instructors address this and address it early. It makes learning easier, more enjoyable and it allows us, students, to spend more time focusing on the important topics in our studies.
