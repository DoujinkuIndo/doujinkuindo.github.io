# Baby Be Mine — The Jelly Beans

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tRS9u43x-A Another serious oldie, this one 49 years old this year — never made it big, peaked at #51; the group, _The Jelly Beans_ formed in Jersey City; existed for three years, recorded two hits, disappeared. This is old east coast R&B — there's no legacy, they don't tour, no best of albums. The label was a niche label, making mostly this sort of music — this must have been an industry, forty, fifty people who crossed paths in 1963 or 1964 in New Jersey to make this one song — and then all went their separate ways, some of them continuing to sing or record or mix, some of them leaving music behind — some of them had training, their parents wanted them to become musicians, some of them didn't — some of them, this was a stop on the way to glory, some of them, this was the best they ever had — some of them, they think about this song every day, some of them never think about it at all. Music (at least the music that lasts) is permanent in that way. Not everything we write or do or say will be remembered on charts, but our musical memory is far more detailed.
