If you're using Windows 7, have you tried pressing the 'Windows' key and either the left or right arrow key at the same time?

What this does is 'half screen' your current application window. This is particularly useful on larger screens. For example I can have a reference document occupy the left half of the screen and write an email in the right half. This works on dual screens as well.
