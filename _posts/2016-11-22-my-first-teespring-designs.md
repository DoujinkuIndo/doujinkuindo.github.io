In an ever long pursuit to diversify my income (I'm already [signing up for checking accounts just for the bonuses](/checking_bonuses/) as well as [buying and reselling things on eBay](/six_essential_items_for_reselling_on_ebay_and_amazon/)), I've taken up the hobby of designing t-shirts. I only have three so far (well, [I have a first one](https://teespring.com/go-sports-team), but it was more to learn the platform), and none have sold. Not surprising since I only launched one yesterday and two today.

There are several places where you can sell custom t-shirts online. One of the oldest is [CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com/), but I wasn't too happy with their t-shirt designer. Essentially, you upload an image, but you have no control where that image appears on the shirt. Plus CafePress had bad reviews on the quality of their shirts.

[TeeSpring](https://teespring.com/) has both an online designer, as well as the option to upload images. For that [first shirt](https://teespring.com/go-sports-team) I linked above, I just used their online designer. For my first "real" design, I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) (which I found had a small learning curve), added an image I got from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/), and finished it off in [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net). My second and third designs (which are almost identical) I just made in [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net).

Without further ado, the shirts are:
