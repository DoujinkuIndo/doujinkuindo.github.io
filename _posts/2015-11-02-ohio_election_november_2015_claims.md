title: Ohio Election November 2015 - Claims
tags: [politics]
---

In a [previous post](/ohio_election_november_2015/) I linked to all the various internet sites about the candidates I could find. In this post I am going to list the claims made by the political postcards I've received in the mail. Especially since the election is tomorrow, I'm probably not going to verify these claims, at least not here.

### Proposed Tax Levy

#### Issue 13: Sinclair Community College Current Operating Expenses

Additional 1 mill for the purpose of capital improvements & essential educational operations, starting 2016 and lasting for 8 years.

I received a total of four (4) postcards for this issue.

##### Claims

2. UP-TO-DATE labs, technology and training for future careers
3. Guarantee Sinclair stays AFFORDABLE for students, young and old
