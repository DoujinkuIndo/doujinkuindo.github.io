title: Ohio Election November 2015 - Claims
tags: [politics]
---

In a [previous post](/ohio_election_november_2015/) I linked to all the various internet sites about the candidates I could find. In this post I am going to list the claims made by the political postcards I've received in the mail. Especially since the election is tomorrow, I'm probably not going to verify these claims, at least not here.

### Proposed Tax Levy

#### Issue 13: Sinclair Community College Current Operating Expenses

Additional 1 mill for the purpose of capital improvements & essential educational operations, starting 2016 and lasting for 8 years.

I received a total of four (4) postcards for this issue.

<li>UP-TO-DATE labs, technology and training for future careers</li>

#### Dayton Municipal Court Judge

##### Colette Moorman

I received two (2) postcards for this candidate. One of the postcards has (what I assume to be) negative information about her opponent, **Mia Wortham Spells**. This "negative information" is that Mia Wortham Spells is endorsed by the Miami Valley Trial Lawyers Association ("Trial Lawyers" is highlighted in yellow) and she is / was Assistant Dayton City Prosecuter for 5 years (I'm assuming this is "negative" because it's less than Colette Moorman's 12 years).

###### Claims

1. Assistant Dayton City Prosecuter for 12 years
2. Assistant Kettering City Prosecuter for 2 years
3. Full-time Dayton Municipal Court Magistrate for 10 years

##### Matt Joseph

I received two (2) postcards for this candidate. One of those postcards also was for Chris Shaw.

###### Claims

The postcards say "re-elect", so Matt Joseph is an incumbent. One postcard has a paragraph saying:

> **City Commissioner Matt Joseph** understands that encouraging economic growth and protecting vital city services are essential to Dayton. In addition to serving as your city commissioner, Matt Joseph works for Dayton's largest employer, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where he helps keep members of our Air Force equipped and ready to defend our country.

The postcards say he will continue to / is committed to

<div class="two-column"><ol><li>Strengthen the city's safety and emergency service departments</li>
<li>Encourage business development opportunities for the city</li>
<li>Promote strong, safe neighborhoods</li>
<li>Improve customer service at city hall</li>
<li>Make Dayton a welcoming place for business and residents</li>
<li>Hire more police officers to increase the safety of neighborhoods and citizens</li>
<li>Use community policing techniques to increase visibility of police and resolve issues</li>
<li>Increase funding for street paving in neighborhoods</li>
<li>Develop technology, like the Dayton Delivers App, to improve customer service</li></ol></div>

###### Endorsed by

1. The Fraternal Order of Police

##### Chris Shaw

I received one (1) postcard for this candidate. That postcard was also for Matt Joseph.

###### Claims

The postcards say he is committed to

6. Hire more police officers to increase the safety of neighborhoods and citizens
7. Use community policing techniques to increase visibility of police and resolve issues
8. Increase funding for street paving in neighborhoods
9. Develop technology, like the Dayton Delivers App, to improve customer service

##### Scott Sliver

I received one (1) postcard for this candidate.

###### Claims

The postcard has a paragraph saying:

> Scott Sliver (sly-ver) is an independent candidate. He closed his business 25 years ago to do community service. He's responsible for feeding nearly 1,000 families in the Miami Valley every month. He listens, he's compassionate, he takes action. It's time to elect a creative problem solver who stays awake at night thinking how to stop hunger, fight addiction, and make our community a better place. He brings people together. He *grows* hope. He's what Dayton needs.
