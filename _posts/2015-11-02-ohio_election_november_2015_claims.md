---

In a [previous post](/ohio_election_november_2015/) I linked to all the various internet sites about the candidates I could find. In this post I am going to list the claims made by the political postcards I've received in the mail.

### Proposed Tax Levy

#### Issue 13: Sinclair Community College Current Operating Expenses

Additional 1 mill for the purpose of capital improvements & essential educational operations, starting 2016 and lasting for 8 years.
