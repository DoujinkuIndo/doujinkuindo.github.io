_Anatta_ - "there is no self", or "self is non-self". Then what is free will? How can we be responsible for our actions?

Free will is an illusion because there is no basis for a will to apply, there is no __agent__.

Self is like the spin of a gyroscope, it has a __drive__ of its own but this drive is not a thing in itself, it is conditioned, and is bound to the nature of the gyroscope. Self is conditioned by the twirl of _sankhara_.
