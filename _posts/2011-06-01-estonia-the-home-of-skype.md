The more you know: Skype is an Estonian company (although the head office is situated in Luxembourg&#8230; incidentally, Luxembourg is the capital of Luxembourg. How&#8217;s that for an educational blog?!).

We hopped on a cruise from Helsinki to the Estonian capital, Tallin, for a two hour ride across the Baltic. The awesome weather is back and it&#8217;s been quite warm. This stop was kind of designed as a two-day chill out before heading down to Riga in Latvia and then onto Kiev.

We were all pretty instantly pleased with the choice to come here. There aren&#8217;t really any must-see sights specifically, but the &#8216;old town&#8217; section which is contained within some old timey city walls was a neat little network of cobbled alleys and laneways making for some good chilling out and people watching. Compared to Finland this place is quite reasonable with prices and I&#8217;m pretty happy to finally be back in countries that understand coffee and take it seriously. Ahhhh I&#8217;ve missed the good stuff.

The only real commentary I have is really pretty stupid when I think about it, but given a complete lack of knowledge of Eastern Europe I was expecting a place that was much smaller, much more quiet and I guess without quite the same abundance of &#8216;everyday luxuries&#8217; you&#8217;d expect in any western country. If I didn&#8217;t know better, someone could have convinced me we were anywhere in western Europe.

Dave and I went for a bit of an aimless wander yesterday and came across some pretty large and relatively abstract concrete structures which turned out to be a war memorial. Strangely enough there were absolutely no plaques or anything to explain what was going on.

I definitely recommend Tallinn if you ever get a chance to head up this way at all.
