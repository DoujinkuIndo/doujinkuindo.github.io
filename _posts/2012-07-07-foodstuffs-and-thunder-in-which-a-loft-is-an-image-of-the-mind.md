# Foodstuffs and Thunder: In Which a Loft is an Image of the Mind

Walked something like a hundred blocks today in the sweltering heat. Today was a foodie day. Crepes and Ice Cream and Meatballs and Thai food and Candy and Baked Goods and just the most phenomenal foodstuffs Tribeca has to offer. And a gigantic loft full of cluttered things and a distinct and accurate sense of being lived in. And if architecture speaks volumes about who a person is, then this loft was the very image of transparency; everything they owned was hung on the walls. No shelves, no boxes, no secrets. Gorgeous and cluttered and messy and incredible. Very alive. There's thunder - god, I hate bringing the cliche of weather into my writing! - and it's bursting miles overhead, and there's a minute or two delay between when the thunder breaks and the rain starts falling in sheets. I like that there's a warning before the rain. Air pressure is looking out for me. Spent a bit of money, too. But what else is money for, if not for food, friends, and travel?
