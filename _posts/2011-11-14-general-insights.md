I've got back from the the Sage Insights conference on the Sunshine Coast, Australia. There were a couple of things that I've found of key interest:

- We saw a demo of the Sage ACT! Premium for Web HTML5 interface. Really liked the look of this, quite excited about this as I'm sure a number of our clients are going to love this.
- Got to speak with some Sage NA staff re the 2012 'feature that isn't a feature' Sage Analytics. I see this as being of benefit to a number of our clients as it allows them to quickly rearrange a view of their data to show their key metrics.
- Hearing the continuing focus on allowing the clients to choose if they want on-premise deployment or cloud/private cloud deployments. Good to know the plan is not to force clients into a SaaS only model like Salesforce.
- Hearing Chris Gordon at SwiftPage (providers of Sage ACT! E-Marketing) talk about what they've seen work for e-marketing users and give examples of those. Great info.

Of course it was great to catch up in person with those that came from the Sage USA, Sydney and Melbourne and especially the other ACC's that attended from around Australia and New Zealand. The next 12 months promise some change. I'm looking forward to it.
