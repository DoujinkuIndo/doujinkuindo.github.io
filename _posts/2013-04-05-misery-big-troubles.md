# Misery — Big Troubles

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uctff64tYI I guess this is a prevailing trend in modern pop — this sort-of-indie, sort-of-60s vibe, fuzzy and lo-fi and heavily produced to look under-produced; four-four songs with simple chords and echoey vocals, happy music with a steady beat, but depressed or understated vocals. But it meanders and dawdles — there's no ambition, and there shouldn't be. It's a song for stasis, again — there's no room for improvement, it doesn't want to improve, it doesn't want anything. It's a stubborn and sad song, and it's entirely purposeful. Yet, instead of repulsed by the song's attitude, we are instead seduced by instrumentation, arrangement, fuzzy deep bass and echoes and an inviting sound landscape. It becomes easy to lose yourself in this music and tune out the world. This, I think, makes it dangerous.
