<blockquote>&ldquo;Your ability to become a successful entrepreneur is about taking your current “informed pessimism” idea and turning the corner into “informed optimism”.  If every time you get to the disappointing “informed pessimism” stage, you impatiently hop back to a new idea at &lsquo;uninformed optimism&rsquo;, you’ll get caught in a never ending cycle. You have to be patient long enough with your idea to see if you are able to turn the corner.&rdquo; - Vinicius Vacanti</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://viniciusvacanti.com/2010/08/03/new-ideas-can-kill-your-startup/">http://viniciusvacanti.com/2010/08/03/new-ideas-can-kill-your-startup/</a>
