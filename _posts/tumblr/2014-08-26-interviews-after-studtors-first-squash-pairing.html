<p>So, I interviewed my friend Avi (student of a Squash lesson) about his experience learning squash from a stranger.</p>
<p>Overall, he had a great experience! He loved the quality of the lesson and was surprised that Steph (the instructor) was a first-time teacher. He really enjoyed the cost-free aspect of the lesson. He also mentioned that he would have paid up to $30 for the lesson or exchanged his knowledge of financial modeling for the lesson. I can&rsquo;t tell if he was being polite, but he also said that he&rsquo;d do it again as a non-guinea pig since he learned the basics of squash. </p>
<p>He brought up some interesting points. First, it&rsquo;s tough finding good teachers. Even though he was thoroughly impressed with Steph&rsquo;s ability to teach squash as a first-time teacher, he felt like I would eventually have problems finding teachers who are quality teachers. He felt like the student&rsquo;s experience would be poor if the teacher did a poor job of conveying information, regardless of price. I am not certain of this assumption actually&hellip;  if my teacher wasn&rsquo;t great but was worth paying $20 for but not $80, would I still go back to the teacher if $20 was the lowest price on the market and if I felt I was still learning? My gut says yes, but I definitely understand his point: scaling while trying to provide high-quality lessons would be very difficult.</p>
<p>Lastly, a thought of my own: Peer-to-peer marketplaces are difficult to set up when the customer doesn&rsquo;t expect variability in the service and when it&rsquo;s hard to provide transparency of quality. For example, I think it would be difficult to setup a business when the service providers vary in quality AND if the customer doesn&rsquo;t expect or appreciate that variability. When I worked at Kitchensurfing, I witnessed this problem to some degree. Customers did not really appreciate that a $60 per head meal would be widely different in quality from a meal prepared by another chef at the same price point. However, I imagine a business like Etsy doesn&rsquo;t really have this same problem. Customers seem to embrace the fact that Etsy&rsquo;s goods vary from item to item. I wonder why. Is it because they like the variability when it comes to bespoke goods? Or is it because the picture of the good on Etsy&rsquo;s site establishes a high degree of trust and sets expectations about what they are buying. My gut points to the latter reason. Unfortunately for my skill-sharing idea, that clarity is not something that a customer has when purchasing a squash lesson or purchasing a chef&rsquo;s services. I wonder how to get around this problem? Do I find a way to provide quality control? Do I believe cutting out services where there is wide variability is a must? How does a company like CoachUp deal with the problem of variability in sports coaching? Is this a major problem? How does a company balance offering quality in-person instruction with quality control and consistency issues?</p>
