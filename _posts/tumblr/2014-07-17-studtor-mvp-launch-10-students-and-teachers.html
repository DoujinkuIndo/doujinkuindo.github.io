<p>I finally was able to get enough teachers and students to launch the first version Studtor. Here was my intro email!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>Hey awesome friends and family!</span></p>
<p><span>Studtor 1.0 is underway and like I promised, I found some good teachers. Here are some topics for which I found some expert volunteers to teach:</span></p>
<div></div>
<div>1) Physics, astrophysics (done over hangout)</div>
<div>2) Squash</div>
<div>3) Javascript</div>
<div>4) LSAT or academic philosophy with an expertise in Witgenstein or epistemic philosophy (done over hangout)</div>
<div>5) Basketball (midtown west, indoors)</div>
<div>6) Tennis</div>
<div>7) cooking (Tina I think called this already)</div>
<div></div>
<div>Would anybody like a free 30-40 minute lesson in either of these topics? My only request is that afterwards, you fill out a questionaire that I send your way.</div>
<div>Expenses (squash) will be paid for.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>If you have any teaching services to lend, please let me know! Write me a short description of what you would like to teach and I will match you up with a student very soon.
