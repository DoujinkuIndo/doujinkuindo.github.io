excerpt: We all know what an icky item is. An icky item is vague and murky, and you’re not really sure where you’d start, how you’d go about doing it, or where you’d get answers to your questions about it. So let’s say your dream is to make your own app, and you know that if you build a successful app you could quit your job and become a full-time developer. You also think that programming ability is the literacy of the 21st century, and you don’t have money to spend outsourcing development anyway, so you decide to anoint “Learn how to code” the winning item on your list—the number one priority. Exciting, right? Well, no, because “Learn how to code” is an intensely icky item—and every time you decide it’s time to get started, you will coincidentally also decide your inbox needs to be cleaned out and your kitchen floor needs to be mopped, ASAP. It’ll never end up happening.

<h4><strong>Effective planning makes an <span>icky</span> item <span>un-icky</span>:</strong></h4>
<div>We all know what an icky item is. An icky item is vague and murky, and you’re not really sure where you’d start, how you’d go about doing it, or where you’d get answers to your questions about it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So let’s say your dream is to make your own app, and you know that if you build a successful app you could quit your job and become a full-time developer. You also think that programming ability is the literacy of the 21st century, and you don’t have money to spend outsourcing development anyway, so you decide to anoint “Learn how to code” the winning item on your list—the number one priority. Exciting, right?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, no, because “Learn how to code” is an intensely icky item—and every time you decide it’s time to get started, you will coincidentally also decide your inbox needs to be cleaned out and your kitchen floor needs to be mopped, ASAP. It’ll never end up happening.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To un-icky the item, you need to read, research, and ask questions to find out exactly how one learns how to code, the specific means necessary for each step along the way, and how long each one should take. Un-ickying a list item turns it from this:</div>

<div>Into this:</div>

<h4><strong>Effective planning turns <span>a daunting item</span> into <span>a series of small, clear, manageable tasks</span>:</strong></h4>
<div>Icky combines with Daunting into an Instant Gratification Monkey steroid potion. And just because you un-icky an item, it doesn’t mean it’s still not horribly big and daunting. The key to de-dauntifying an item is to absorb this fact:</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>A remarkable, glorious achievement is just what a long series of unremarkable, unglorious tasks looks like from far away.</em></div>
<div></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>I think ever since joining Orbital Boot Camp&hellip; it&rsquo;s helped me reduce the icky down into that series of unremarkable, unglorious tasks. Thanks!</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think the project-process and the startup-process probably resembles this description:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<p>No one “builds a house.” They lay one brick again and again and again and the end result is a house. Procrastinators are great visionaries—they love to fantasize about the beautiful mansion they will one day have built—but what they need to be are gritty construction workers, who methodically lay one brick after the other, day after day, without giving up, until a house is built.</p>
</div>
<div>Nearly every big undertaking can be boiled down to a core unit of progress—its brick. A 45-minute gym visit is the brick of getting in great shape. A 30-minute practice session is the brick of becoming a great guitarist.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The average day in a wannabe author’s week and a real author’s week looks almost the same. The real author writes a couple pages, laying a brick, and the wannabe author writes nothing. 98% of their day is otherwise identical. But a year later, the real author has a completed first draft of a book and the wannabe author has…nothing.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>These words really resonate with me&hellip;. especially as I shy away from my programming primer.</div>
</div>
