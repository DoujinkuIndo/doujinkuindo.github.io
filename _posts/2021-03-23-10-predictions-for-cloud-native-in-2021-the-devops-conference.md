From inside CNCF I have a unique insight into cloud native tech, DevOps and ecosystem. Here's what I see coming next!

üõ† Tech
1. More Rust in Cloud Native
1. Cross Cloud becomes (more) real
1. Web Assembly and eBFP
1. [Kubernetes on the Edge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFimQftjkTUsxNGTsKdakvP7cJtJgCTqViH2kwJOrsc/edit#)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª DevOps
1. [GitOps grows significantly](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group)
1. Chaos Engineering practices
1. [Rise of FinOps](https://www.finops.org/)

üåê Ecosystem
1. [Pluggable developer and operator experience](https://backstage.io/)
1. Service mesh consolidation
1. [End user driven open source](http://radar.cncf.io)

Cloud native deployments are getting bigger and more complex, and so you need to stay on top of the latest developments. The best way to do so is to meet the practitioners and community at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Virtual EU, May 4-7](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/). See you there!
