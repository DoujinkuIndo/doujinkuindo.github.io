In the language of Platonic abstraction: a remix of a song is an alternate projection of that song's Ideal Platonic Form. Somewhere on the spiritual plane where only concepts reside, the very **essence** of *Marvin Gaye*'s **Sexual Healing** covers, resplendent. Its essence is defined by the set of properties which, if removed, produce an unfamiliar song. A remix, such as this one by *Kygo*, is an alternate projection. It retains a few of the similarities (vocal riffs, key, tempo, rhythm) while changing many things (production, intonation, timbre, genre).

The reason that remixes and covers (which, despite their differences, essentially serve the same purpose) are so incredibly popular is that they are **refreshing**: they contain familiar elements in new settings: nothing too shocking and different, but certainly not the same old territory. Like a movie sequel, we seek enough familiarity to stay safe, but enough novelty to pique our interest.

This is nothing new. Technology has made audio remixing very easy in the last few decades, but the concept of derivation is ancient. It would be futile to try to list all the authors, playwrights, painters, and sculptors who have been inspired by - and borrowed elements from - each other.
