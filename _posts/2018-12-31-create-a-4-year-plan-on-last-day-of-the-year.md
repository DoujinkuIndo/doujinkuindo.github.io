title: Create a 4-year plan on last day of the year
date: 2018-12-31
---
I rested on my laurels for two years and a haft after I graduated from high school and applied to my university. Because I was too tired and I was too confident in my ability (I used to be a informatics gifted student in high school and the university that I applied to is HCMC University of Information Technology). Therefore, I want to change myself. Today is the last day of the year, I decide to create a 4-year plan.

My goal is becoming an artificial intelligence expert in a large international corporation after this plan. The plan starts on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019 and ends on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023. My plan is a long-term plan that consits of 4 medium-term plans. There are 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 plan. And any of them consists of many short-term plans.

## The 2019 plan
In the first half of 2019, I must complete 2 goals. First goal is getting a TOEIC certificate with score 900. The last goal is getting a machine learning intership in a international corporation.

In the last half of 2019, I must complete only 1 goal. The goal is complete the capstone project with score 9.5.
