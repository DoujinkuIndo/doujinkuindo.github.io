title: Create a 4-year plan on last day of the year
date: 2018-12-31
---
I rested on our laurels for two years and a haft after I graduated from high school and applied to my university. Because I was too tired and I was too confident in my ability (I used to be a informatics gifted student in high school and the university that I applied to is HCMC University of Information Technology). Therefore, I want to change myself. Today is the last day of the year, I decide to create a 4-year plan.<br>
My goal is becoming an AI expert in a large international corporation after this plan. The plan starts on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019 and ends on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023. My plan is a long-term plan that consits of some medium-term plans.
