Above is Fleetwood Mac's Dreams, remixed by Gigamesh. I often write about the power of a remix to elevate a song beyond its original territory into new and even more captivating spaces, and this is a perfect example.
I think it's rather telling that the photograph which Majestic, the music compilation channel on YouTube that uploaded this particular song, chose to place behind the video is one taken from an elevated standpoint.
In philosophy and literature, there is a concept of the sublime, best described as the feeling experienced upon the complete circuit of a mountain; when seen from each individual angle, the fearful, rugged forms of nature appear chaotic, unintelligible. But, upon understanding of the whole, nature elicits a feeling of the sublime, a grasp of something grand, uncommon, and beautiful.
The picture is of the sublime, and the song is too.
