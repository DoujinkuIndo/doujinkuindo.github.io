We had three speakers from Maersk Corporation, MATRIXX Software, and Tecknuovo joining us at our October Cloud Native London meetup at esynergy. We also had virtual attendees joining us via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was James Cull from Tecknuovo wrapping up our evening with a talk on Driving Industrialised Enterprise Cloud Adoption (starting at [10:32](https://youtu.be/7gAPtILNlrc?t=632)). His takeaways discussed: 

* How to drive increased cloud adoption within an organisation and help organisations to drive a cloud-first mentality across both business and IT
* How you can help organisations plan for a move to the cloud, or get greater value out of their existing cloud investment
* How technologists can hone their cloud expertise, develop new skills, and gain access to innovative cloud-led projects by connecting with like-minded communities of technology professionals

Next up we had Paul Graham from MATRIXX Software who described his Lessons Learnt Developing and Deploying a Cloud Native Network Function (starting at [48:03](https://youtu.be/7gAPtILNlrc?t=2883)). His takeaways mentioned how: 

* Telecoms has only recently , as part of 5G, adopted Cloud Native technologies
* There are areas that need some more work for using Cloud Native in Telecoms
* The opportunities are building CNFs that offer the promised 5G low latency apps that are installed into the 5G cores

Finally we had  Dinesh Nithyanandam from Maersk Corporation with a discussion on Code as a Metric (CaaM) - Create measurable outcome by Imposing Custom metric across ecosystem to measure every line of code/service we write and deploy (starting at [1:33:42](https://youtu.be/7gAPtILNlrc?t=5622)). He talked about:

* Quantitative measurement a service/code using code as a metric approach
* Rationalising business centric metric via Apdex score for a service
* Derive/Implement SLO/SLI metrics from code stack
