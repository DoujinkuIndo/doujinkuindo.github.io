# Soul Flower (Remix) — The Pharcyde 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oo2XO_ub18 Compare this to the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls0_u0-EKKA), another similar, good, but very, very different song. Stil, the vibe here is amazing, a sunny day and a smile and a swing in your step all in one, complete and self-sure and brilliant, carefree. It's ambitious rap, and it's totally justified in how amazing it is. Talking about hip-hop with a friend of mine, it becomes apparent that one of the reasons it's often inaccessible is that it's incohesive. Each line of poetry is tonally and rhythmically related to each other, but often they don't form a strict story, the way songs often do. It's free-form, live-as-thought, clever and cheeky and relevant as hell.
