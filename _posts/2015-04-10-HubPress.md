title: Moving to HubPress!
---

Just a quick update: later today, I will be moving my pages to [HubPress.io](https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io),
as I promised myself a couple of months ago.

*P.S.: Quick update: I just moved temporarily back to jekyll-now, as I need to customize the HubPress template and don't have time to do it now.*
