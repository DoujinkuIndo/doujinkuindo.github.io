title: Jekyll is Simple
---

So I've updated my site to use [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It's a static site generator and it's all hosted on GitHub pages. The old one was quite slow, it wasn't very mobile friendly and it required too much mucking about with HTML to add new posts. This lets me write new posts using markdown. **Simple is good**.
