title: Multiple Local Businesses Closed

There was nothing special planned for local businesses on the 500 block of Botetourt St. in downtown Norfolk this past Monday. It was simply the beginning of another week. However, Monday afternoon quickly became the beginning of the end.

A little after 3 p.m., customers and employees of the businesses on Botetourt St. heard a loud rumbling. The metal and clay awning, which ran the stretch of the entire block, abruptly pulled away from the building and brought a large amount of the brick wall with it.

Norfolk Fire and Rescue and Police responded to the incident and there were no injuries reported. Unfortunately, the entire building has been closed off and the businesses have been closed indefinitely. With these businesses closed, people are out of jobs.

A tweet from Cure Coffeehouse and Brasserie ([Website](http://www.curenorfolk.com/index.html)):
\<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"\>\<p lang="en" dir="ltr"\>We will be closed until further notice.&#10;&#10;The awning on the building collapsed, but the most important thing is... \<a href="http://t.co/jW8hG7w8TT"\>http://t.co/jW8hG7w8TT\</a\>\</p\>&mdash; Cure Coffeehouse (@CureCoffeehouse) \<a href="https://twitter.com/CureCoffeehouse/status/607998844337586176"\>June 8, 2015\</a\>\</blockquote\> \<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"\>\</script\>

A number of local businesses have come to the rescue. Specifically, some are offering Cure refrigerator and freezer space, while others are offering employment coverage to those effected.

With an excess of coffee beans and nowhere to brew it, Cure is now offering what they call the “[Cure Bean Bike](mkt.com/curebeanbike);” whole bean coffee delivered right to your door. This weekend and next, Cure will be setting up a pop-up shop in 433 Granby, a local venue for pop-up businesses.

Located at 433 Granby St., [433 Granby](http://433granby.com) offers their space at no charge. They just ask that you come to them with a great idea, are responsible and that you can run your pop-up for a short period of time. Owned by Grow ([Website](http://www.thisisgrow.com)), a nationally known digital agency, 433 Granby has also offered up its space to another business destroyed in the incident: Hummingbird Macarons ([Website](http://www.hummingbirdmacarons.com)).

I stopped by 433 Granby to offer up my support and talked with Jon, an employee of Cure. He said that, “the community has really stepped up and made the entire ordeal a lot easier on us.” A customer behind me, Christen, chimed in saying that her and her friend were there, “because they [Cure](#) make great coffee and we want to support them however we can.”

While immediate support of the businesses from the 500 block of Botetourt St. has been phenomenal, there is still a lot of uncertainty in their future. The least we can do as a community is to offer our continual support and business—when it’s possible. Be sure to check out the businesses’ websites and follow them on social media for more information on how you can help. They have got a long road ahead of them, so let’s try and be there every step of the way.
