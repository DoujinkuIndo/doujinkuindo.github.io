I have to thank Kevin Chieff (ACT! guru) for pointing me to this
[link on how to tell the difference between versions of Microsoft SQL 2005](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2269492&SiteID=1) - and the MS page it points to re the
[SERVERPROPERTY (Transact-SQL) command](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174396.aspx).

The number of times I've had to work out just which version of SQL is running is amazing. The difficulty in doing so is amazing. There ought to be a simple utility that does it all.

So the two links above will get used a lot in conjuction with my
[previous post re determining SQL versions](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/microsoft/what-version-of-sql-server-is-running).
