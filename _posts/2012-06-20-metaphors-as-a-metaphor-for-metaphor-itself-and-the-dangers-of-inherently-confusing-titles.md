# Metaphors as a Metaphor for Metaphor Itself, and The Dangers Of Inherently Confusing Titles

Things got really bad, and then they got really good, and I missed a day. Shit. I had drama with relationships, and I had drama with friendships, and parents, and graduation, and I got a Nook somewhere in there and I've been reading 3 hours a day. And I think the plan of which I spoke might be falling into place, but I'm not sure, and I survived a large Brazilian steak dinner and hours under grueling heat and spotlights and made it look easy and I'm a little tiny bit proud of myself for coming up relatively unscathed. But I missed a day in writing, and I'm going to make it up. So this is that day. No being proud. Go to the beach, be a good friend, don't lose your cool. You had a confrontation. It was funny but it might not have been. Don't let this turn into a journal. This is not a journal. You got engineering books. Become one of those. Learn to spit up the information you swallow; from the Nook, from books, from classes, from other people. Learn to be a cog and an engine and a powerhouse all at once. Every metaphor.
