# Babysitting. CSS. Stephen Colbert. Summer Heat.

Cracked it! HTML/CSS, baby! Got hosting up, FTP'd that shit in, logged in, set up my site. Working with CSS to make it look more like my LaTeX resume. Oh my goodness this stuff is fun. I had no idea. Gonna look into Django instead of PHP. Maybe I can get it to run a text adventure in the site? That would be kick-ass. I hear terrible things about PHP and mySQL. Accidentally left the blink tag on. Lord, that was funny. Loaded it up in firefox and everything was flashing on and off. Classwhole is amazing. Se7en is amazing. Thrift stores are amazing. Terrible summer heat and walking too much is amazing. Crazy old ladies who take shopping very very seriously are amazing. Babysitting us while we tried on plaid shirts down to our knees was... amazing. Falafel is amazing. Dumplings. Whose Line. Late subway rides. Stephen King. Summer days and train delays and free MetroCard swipes. Work starts soon, and people leave the city. It seems like it'll go on forever, but it's only been for about a week. Still.
