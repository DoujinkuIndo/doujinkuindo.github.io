# In Which the Sky Acts as a Blueprint, the Ego Blinded by Emotion is Given Cautious Reign, and the Records of My Life are Preserved

I know a good person who occasionally cares and occasionally tries, and that is all I can ask of them. I don't think anything in particular could make me think better or less of her. Some people are just constants. I will not play therapist, but I will be there for you. I will not idolize my friends or myself, but I will try to overlook flaws. I will not celebrate, but I will cherish modestly. I will not chalk up to malevolence that which can be explained by naivete. I will not regift what can be better appreciated with time. I will not destroy the records of my life, but I not regret moving on when necessary. I will not follow rules that don't make sense to me at the time. The ego blinded by emotion is still the ego; I am still responsible for my actions, be they influenced by fleeting impulsivity or drawn-out, sober decision-making. Both are fallible, both have the same impact, both are honestly my decision. A good call and a slow call are not always the same. I will not mistake indecision for informed decision. I will not take my sweet time, but I will not be hurried either. I will not remain unhappy in love in hopes of a better future. Tomorrow comes continually, and it is the child of today. There is no future, but there is at least a plan for it. There is no hope, but there is always the will to occasionally care and occasionally try. If that is all I can expect from those I - not love, but respect - then that is all I can expect from myself.
