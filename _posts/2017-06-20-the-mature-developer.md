Earlier in my career as a Dev, I was always in a kind of awe when entering a scoping meeting with my colleagues who, upon gathering the brief, restrictions and looking at the specs, would seem to immediately know the ‘best’ solution.

Since, I always imagined I’d reach a point where upon running through a spec or set of requirements, I too would come to ‘just know’ ahead of crunch time, exactly how something would be built and all the considerations that might impact the project - knowing the right solution, and communicating this at once with a reassuring intonation.

Throughout our career, as we become involved in more digital projects, often with different restrictions and deliverables each time, we come up pretty quickly to capacity on what we can reasonably expect ourselves to know about in web development, while still maintaining enough awareness of all the caveats and other considerations from other disciplines involved: if you’re a front-end dev, then issues of user experience, dev ops, security will in themselves impact what we’re doing and what solutions are available to us.

On approaching a project, we seek understand the problem being solved itself, and bring to bear our most recent understanding of what is available to us to form a solution based on our best estimation. 

With developer maturity comes an appreciation of how seldom this is an easy or I dare say, accurate process, especially in a waterfall context. Capturing the best of everyone’s knowledge of the solutions available, time estimation, curating the right project team, is hard. And that’s ok; it should be.

Thinking we can ‘learn all the things’ is an endless, uphill exercise in burnout and this unicorn-like peak knowledge is something we’ll never ‘arrive at’ and is really an unhealthy illusion that damages our industry. Instead, we should look to focus on core principles in our primary responsibility, and look to gain a little bit of insight from those around us:

We are responsible for our part in a project, and we should allow for what we cannot change, and act on the aspects we can, including setting the right expectation with the stakeholders. We’ll often find those very same people didn't expect us to have all the answers, and will respect your honesty and forthrightness!
 
We never have all the information; only ever approaching truth, yet we must execute anyway, and the mature developer recognises uncertainty not as an aberration, but something to shore up against when estimating and to communicate effectively. We’re then able to make peace with the reality of our environment.

Our job is characterised by operating on a daily basis with a patchy map of the problem and technical solutions, and so we’ve learned to trust ourselves despite this, always knowing we may encounter some previously ‘unknown unknowns’ and handling for that with estimates and honest communication; it’s our responsibility to say No, and to be honest at all times.

This is a much more sustainable aspiration for web devs, especially those looking to be effective Seniors and Leads. Of course Maturity isn't a title given to who’s been anywhere the longest or whatever, but an attitude that any self-motivated software team will benefit from encouraging in all members. 
The best organisations allow their people this space; that implicit trust to seek feedback from colleagues, and admit to not knowing things.

Development is challenging, often fragmented and problematic, but is a unique job in that we face problems every day to which we don’t yet know the answer, and often need to learn something new in order to solve it. Yet as long as we’re coming up against these technical challenges, were growing as devs. It’s simultaneously painful and rewarding, but we quickly learn that to not burn out, we have to able to become comfortable with that frustration more than most people, and be able to trust ourselves.

To be mature is to become adept at ‘leaning in’ slowly to new problems rather than just expecting ourselves to know all the answers up front; and that is - it has to be - fine for us to operate as healthy developers.

As an aside, always entertaining  [@MPJME](https://twitter.com/@MPJME) did a great video on this condition of perpetual frustrations, grit, and problem-solving. Give him all the likes.
