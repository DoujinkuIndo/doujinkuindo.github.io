# Anthems for a Seventeen-Year Old Girl — Broken Social Scene

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDqNL0js0iU I talk a lot about the disparity between tone and content — a song like this that sounds so quiet, gentle, romantic, kind and sweet, must be happy, or at least bittersweet, sad despite itself — it must be a love song, or a song about loss, death, maybe birth. And that's what I thought, for ages — it was an anthem for a girl, by a guy, both at seventeen, and they're in love. All I could hear was the middle verse, the one that goes _dream about me_. But the rest of the song, I realize, is more about what seventeen-year-old girls (and guys, it should be noted) are more famous for — drama, betrayal, being two-faced and acerbic; self-improvement and repression, the frantic race to grow up and hide the bitter parts of yourself behind makeup. And for a while, the song plods on at odds with itself, bitter tone with sweet tune. And then it takes its turn — when the love song section in the middle kicks in, it becomes honest, forgiving — a love song, a song of acceptance, of romantic intent despite — or, perhaps, because of — the professed, rotten qualities. So it sort of turns it on its head.
