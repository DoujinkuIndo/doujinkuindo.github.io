Primary Concerns

The pollution of oceans with plastics of all kinds. The pacific ocean now has plastics accumulating in the pacific gyre creating a massive garbage island. This is extremely harmful
to marine life. Turtles get trapped in plastic rings, birds and fish eat plastics that bioaccumulate in them and soon they end up on our dinner plates. Other top predators are also at risk due to biomagnification up the trophic levels. This will only decrease biodiversity at a time when global warming is already wiping out species as is.
