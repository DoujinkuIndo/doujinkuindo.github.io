The next few months are ramping up to be huge in terms of new releases, I&#8217;m really looking forward to a few of them particularly the new Alexisonfire record and Moneen&#8217;s teaser EP&#8230;

A whole bunch of new songs have gone up over the past few days, give them a listen!

**Look Mexico**, they&#8217;ve just signed to Suburban Home and are demoing at the moment, a couple are up on their myspace:

**Moneen**. New 4 track EP through Dine Alone Records, only available on 12&#8243;&#8230; Might pick one of these up when I catch them in London in a couple weeks. Album is streaming over at Vinyl Collective:

**Alexisonfire**. I think I&#8217;m going to really enjoy this one&#8230; judging by the 2 tracks that have surfaced it sounds like they&#8217;re shifting away from relying so heavily on Dallas&#8217; vocals and going for a more gruff and raw sound while still doing it different to how they have in the past. I want. Now.

**Set Your Goals**. New album out in a month or two, the first new song (_Fallen_) is catchy as hell and incredible live! Another newy, _This Will Be The Death Of Us_, just went up today or yesterday and I&#8217;m not quite sold yet but that&#8217;s exactly how I felt about Mutiny the first time I listened to it&#8230; I have faith in these guys, I know I&#8217;ll be picking up that record ASAP.

And on a completely unrelated note here&#8217;s some footage from Sasquatch festival in Washington that a friend who went showed me&#8230; This is hilarious! It&#8217;ll take about a minute to really kick in but it&#8217;s totally worth watching the whole clip!
