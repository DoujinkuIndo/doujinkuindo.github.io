Environmental Ethics

Are we anthropocentric, Biocentric or Ecocentric?

I believe that as a whole, we are anthropocentric. However, I also believe that a large number of people today are at least biocentric. It's just that to sustain the current demand for production, resources must be harvested at a faster rate. This means that human needs for products is often put before the biota or the ecosystem.

It is often expected of us to put our species first. Although possibly counterintuitive, the survival of other species is actually beneficial to our survival. A biocentric view means thinking of all elements of the biota as equals. No human comes before any bear or plant or insect.
