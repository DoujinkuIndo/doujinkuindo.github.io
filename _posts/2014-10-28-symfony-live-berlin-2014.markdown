This week I will be visiting my first official conference [Symfony Live in Berlin](http://berlin2014.live.symfony.com/) and I feel very excited about it!

On Wednesday 29th I will be having a very busy day during the workshop [Web Services with Symfony2](http://berlin2014.live.symfony.com/workshops/). I am looking forward to it, since you know I have been writing about the topic before.

> I promise to come back and update you with all new things I will be learning in the coming days, so stay tuned for more!

You can check [here](http://berlin2014.live.symfony.com/programm/) the full conferences programme. Are you visiting the conferences and would like to meet? You can find me [here](https://twitter.com/miriamtocino). See you all in Berlin!
