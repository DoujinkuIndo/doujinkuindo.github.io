>The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is trying to make it easier for companies to choose a multicluster management solution for their environments with the release of its fifth CNCF End User Technology Radar. The radar is a guide to emerging technologies that are chosen based on feedback from the CNCF End User Community.
>
>According to the CNCF, distributed and multi-cloud deployments have benefits like improved availability, reduced latency, and scalability, but also increases complexity because each cluster has to be individually deployed and managed.
>
>The CNCF End User Technology Radar for multicluster management is divided into two categories: 1) cluster deployment, and 2) core services and add-ons. This is intended to differentiate between tools used for deployment and management. Each sub-category is further divided into tools to Adopt, Trial, or Assess.
