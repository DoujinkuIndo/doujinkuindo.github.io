Here I'll praise *Gorillaz*, the *Damon Albarn*-led virtual alt-hip-hop supergroup, for a production style so fluid and (presumably) creatively freeing that any two tracks are guaranteed to have almost no styles, genres, themes, vocalists, instruments, or even musicians in common. A persistent theme is the firm hand of the musician-as-auteur: Damon Albarn regularly recruits session musicians, prodigious rappers, reknowned orchestras, famous producers, etc. to work on tracks for Gorillaz. The resulting product is bound only by the consistent, strong creative intentions behind each track.

For example: the original [Stylo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SxlD74hvRk) (not the *Alex Metric *remix, above) is a little bit funk/soul, a little bit electro, a little bit dance-rock. *Mos Def*,'00s NY-area rapper, and *Bobby Womack*, '70s R&B/soul artist, make an appearance, each shifting the genre towards their respective playing fields. The remix, by contrast, remains firmly dance-pop, at 1.36 shifting to a nearly disco feel, and then resolving around the 3.30 mark to an '80s synth sound.

These are stylistic fluidities that we take for granted. I was raised on this sort of genre-blending music. But my parents, my piano instructor; anyone older than around 30 would immediately perk up and notice that the song is shifting between genres. If modern culture is a (racial) melting pot, modern music is a complex amalgamation of cultures, eras, genres, and styles.

Moreover, *Gorillaz* is founded around this concept: their genre-fluidity encourages remixes and edits in even more genres. Perhaps Damon Albarn could only cast one projection of a song's essence, but there are still other edits waiting to be made. Above is the *Feed Me* remix of **Melancholy Hill**, a synth-pop remix of the already synth-pop original taken to an extreme, removing almost all real instruments and overriding nearly everything with pounding sine wave synths and 808 drums.

Here is **19-2000** remade by *Soulchild* in the image of a mid-90s Harlem hip-hop track, almost like the *Pharcyde*'s [Soul Flower Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oo2XO_ub18 ). I think this is super fitting, as mid-90s hip-hop was some of the first (best?) sampled music, repurposing 60s and 70s funk and jazz with modern drums to create the track instrumentals. Gorillaz seem to have embraced this sentiment, if not the precise practice. 

On the topic of Gorillaz (and because no essay would be complete without it), I'll include **Doncamatic**, featuring the previously little-known '10s British R&B singer *Daley*, who rose to fame through this track. [See](www.youtube.com/embed/OJQyTnD74gk)

At the time of production, Gorillaz was close to disbanding. Damon, having already been through one band, *Blur*, was ready to move on. The **Doncamatic** lyrics coyly reference the fatigue of nearly 13 years of production. 
	Download me / make up for the time you wasted
	The song is not the same when we're all played out
	They say the memory's all played out
Nowhere is this more apparent than in their final single, **Do Ya Thing** feat. *Andre 3000*, *James Murphy*. [See](www.youtube.com/embed/Nf_PmmlCiso)

Everything about this video screams **creative differences**. Andre 3000, no stranger to the in-fighting of *OutKast*, raps about doing your own damn thing; James Murphy sings about acting like he doesn't care; *2-D* reads a comic depicting his abusive roommate *Murdoc* as a kind, thankful friend, juxtaposed with Murdoc beating him with a shoe. The ending skit of the video is especially telling. Murdoc puts on a record for his home-radio show: it is the first Gorillaz single, *5/4*, with a quip: Remember this one?
