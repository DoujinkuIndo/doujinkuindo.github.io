I know two people who have just bought themselves new Apple Mac computers, one a behemoth desktop, the other a 15" MacBook Pro. Both have been immersed in "Windows World" and are essentially new to the Mac OS (one did have a Mac years ago).

So, where to start?

Here are my initial tips:*Be prepared for some frustration. It doesn't work the way you're used to. Yes, it's change. It's worth it, you'll be more productive, I am.


*The keyboard and the trackpad are your friend. More than you know.
[Learn the 'gestures'](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4721). single tap on the trackpad is a left click, two finger tap on the trackpad is a right click.


*Get in the habit of pressing the 'Option' key. You'll suddenly find extra
options.


*Use COMMAND-SPACE to start Spotlight. Use Spotlight.


*Use
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) as your browser.


*Working with words? do your drafts in
[ByWord](http://bywordapp.com/). Power tip: learn
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).


*Working with programming code? use
[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/).

That's a start. I'm sure they'll have more questions yet.
