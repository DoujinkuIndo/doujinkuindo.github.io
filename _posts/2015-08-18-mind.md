title: "Learning and Thinking Style"
---

One of the things I really like about Dev Bootcamp versus others is that they emphasize a lot about the individual and self reflection.

Part of the pre-Phase 0 work is figuring our what your learning and thinking style is. You just do a self-evaluation on [this site](http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html).

Here were my results:

|  s               | **Concrete**   | **Abstract**  |
|:---:             |:---:           |:---:          |
| **Sequential**   | 40             | 48            |
| **Random**       | 28             | 4             |

It would seem that my style is particularly "Concrete" and "Sequential." Additionally, it's particularly not "Abstract" and "Random."

What's all this mean?

Well based on the Professor Anthony Gregorc's [research](http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm), I prefer order and systematized, logical thinking. I like to stick to the facts and act on them. Less ideal are things that are unorganized and unpredictable.

In general, I view all these personality surveys as a way to seek out the gist of who you are. It's not perfect, but in general it's accurate I'd say.

I'll need to work on trusting people to do things more often and be comfortable with uncertainty since that's the real world after all.
