[CNCF Publishes Latest Technology Radar Focused on Secrets Management - InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/04/cncf-radar-secrets-management/)

> CNCF published the fourth edition of the end-user Technology Radar. This time the theme was secrets management: the set of tools and technologies to manage digital authentication. The purpose of this edition is to share what tools are used by end-users, what tools they recommend, and to identify any patterns that have emerged.
>
>The Technology Radar team reported four themes that came out of this survey. The first theme is the widespread adoption of HashiCorp Vault. While Vault has sometimes been considered in the industry as a complex tool with a high operational burden, the Technology Radar team believes it removes the complexity of creating an in-house tool and also that it appears to be a convenient solution for multi-cloud environments.
>
>The second theme is that offerings from cloud providers were also widely adopted among the participating companies. This includes AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Key Management Service, AWS Certificate Manager, Azure Key Vault, and GCP Secrets Management.
