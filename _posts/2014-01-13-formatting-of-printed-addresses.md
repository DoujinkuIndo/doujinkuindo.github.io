How should you format an address on printed labels and envelopes?


[Formatting addresses for printing in Australia](http://auspost.com.au/parcels-mail/addressing-guidelines.html):

>Typically, the address should be written in three lines:

- The top line should contain the recipient's name
- The second to last line should contain the number and name of the street, PO Box or locked bag number (if applicable)
- The last line should contain the place name or post office of delivery, state or territory abbreviation and postcode. This line should be printed in capitals without punctuation or underlining, with the postcode put last
- For international mail, the country name should be in capitals on the bottom line

For the rest of the world, see
[Wikipedia's entry on Address (geography)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_(geography)).
