title: Using GitPages instead of Medium

I've gone hacker!

Well, *sort of.* 

I have been on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) for quite awhile but it was time for a change. Welcome to my new GitPages powered website! It's is static, which means it'll load super fast! It also means it's easier for me to manage as well as customize. I get the power of github along with free hosting which is pretty sweet. 

You may notice that while I moved a bunch of content over I did not move it all. I decided to do some spring cleaning and only keep the "hits", leaving the rest behind and letting me focus on new things.
