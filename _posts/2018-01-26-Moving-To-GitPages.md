I've gone hacker!

Well, *sort of.* 

I have been on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) for quite awhile. When I first signed up for it it was a breath of fresh air. A beautiful and easy to read content platform that encouraged sharing. I was in love. 

As a restless creative type I started getting sick of it for many reasons. One of the main ones simply being that I couldn't tweak it and make it my own.

I also didn't like that I couldn't really control things that affect SEO and usability. I also like to mess with things and I wanted my website to be a sort of "test bed" for new projects and ideas. You can't really do that on Medium. 

Enter GitHub Pages. 

GitHub pages is a free service offered by GitHub that allows you to host a static website. 

What? 

You might ask. But, this is a blog! 

You're right. It is. It is a static blog. I am using Jeckyll to take markdown in GitHub and turn it into static HTML. This means the website is lightning quick and accessible. 

It was a bit of a learning curve to get to this point. I had to learn how to use GitHub for one (a very usefull skill!) and learn how the themeing works, posting, markdown etc. 

I built the site using the lazy way: I forked a blog that's already built. You can find the repository [here.](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). 

I then went on the fun journey of learning to edit the thing and tweak it to what I wanted. This included figuring out how to add pagination (only 5 posts will show on my home page and you have "next" and "previous" for other posts), installing bootstrap, fixing a million things in the css and more. 

In the end I've hacked together what I think is an easy to read, good looking website that I can edit from anywhere and is free! 

If you prefer the design of my site over the original I forked, the repository is [here.](https://github.com/kolemcrae/kolemcrae.github.io)
