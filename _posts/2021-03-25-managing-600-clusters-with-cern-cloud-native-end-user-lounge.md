It was a pleasure to launch the Cloud Native End User Lounge with Ricardo Rocha from CERN!

I'm constantly amazed by the scale of what Ricardo and his team achieves at CERN. As an [End User Representative to the TOC](https://www.cncf.io/people/technical-oversight-committee/) and co-chair of the [CNCF Research User Group](https://github.com/cncf/research-user-group), Ricardo is truly committed to the community and always a fantastic person to collaborate with.

The Cloud Native End User Lounge will feature more end users on with regular interviews on Twitch and YouTube. Check out [cloudnative.tv](cloudnative.tv) for upcoming shows.
