Having covered the "What" of the business
moving on to letter 
A for Accounting a.k.a the "How Much"

This is where we can get an idea about the profitability (or even plain viability) of the business

## Assumptions & Hopes 

A also stands for assumptions & hopes a.k.a. the Business plan

Let's see the [textbook definition][1] 
> A business plan is a formal written document containing business goals, the methods on how these goals can be attained, 
> and the time frame within which these goals need to be achieved.

The first thought that comes to mind is that of a long, [formal document][3] 
A lot of time [spent typing rather than doing][2] 
This tends to put a lot of people off

They key thing to note here is that the business plan document is not the goal
The thinking and research that goes into the document is the goal
The document itself is just the prompt to trigger this process.

If the founder(s) have built the exact same business before and have deep domain knowledge
then a business plan is a wasted effort; they have all the answers in their heads.
For everyone else it is a necessary exercise

Some key aspects of the business plan creation

### TAM & TM
The [total addressable market][4] describes the size of the opportunity 
Startups are all about growth  
knowing that the total market value has many zeros behind it, gets everyone very excited 
Who doesn't want to ride the next rocket to the moon?

What is probably more important though is to realistically define the initial [target market][5] 
Which cohort of customers would buy from this business in its first few years? 
Who are they? What are their characteristics and preferences? 
How many are they? Where can they be found, how can the business reach them?  

Depending on the nature of the business, the answers to these questions may be crystal clear
Or not <sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>

The important bit here is to have a clear distinction between  
* the size of the TAM (when the business has reached world domination), and
* the possibly more humble initial TM (when the business will be struggling to make end meet)    

Clearly identifying and defining the TM will keep the business' efforts focused 
Once that segment of the market is captured, 
the business can apply the ["tip of the spear strategy"][6] and expand to other TAM segments

### Competition

Another important bit of this exercise is identifying the competition
The previous step identified the size of the pie
this one how many are eating from it

It might be tempting to just skip 
but [identifying competitors][7] can lead to some useful qualitative conclusions 
both for the founder and investors 
* Validation of the opportunity  
Having other businesses in the same space is a confirmation that there are customers willing to pay for the product
or service. 
* Competitive opportunity  
The identified competitors' short-comings and mistakes are opportunities to take advantage of (and mistakes to avoid).
* Customer awareness  
A corollary of the above is that customers are already aware of the product type
It is a very different effort to market [something invented than something innovative][8] (hint: inventions take much 
more customer education).
* Pricing reference  
Determining what is fair value from a customer's point-of-view may turn out to be a long, hit-and-miss process. 
Having one or more reference price points greatly accelerates the [price discovery][9] for the new product/service. 

With regards to the actual quantitative outcome of this exercise, there are 3 possible outcomes  
* No competitors  
Being early 
either something that noone wants or the beginning of a new big thing  
In this case it takes conviction (on the part of the founders) and persuasion (for both customers and investors) 
to believe that it is something useful
* Some competitors  
This is a validation that there is a market 
In this case winning is a matter of execution 
* Too many competitors  
Qualifying the word "many" is a bit subjective 
in general if it's a crowded and small market it might not be a good sign 
especially if this new business does not have a true differentiating factor 
it is a different discussion if the market is huge, in which case there is space for everyone

Identifying competition is not meant to dissuade 
Having competitors in a field is actually a good thing
helps keep the business' efforts grounded and focused 

### Pricing  

a.k.a. How to charge for things and (hopefully) make money

The first aspect is "how much"
This can be answered more easily if there are already players in the market
Looking at their prices, can provide some data points to use as a basis and guide
Then based on that decide the price strategy 
undercut competition
or go on par and above (superior service / luxury product)

There are 2 basic revenue models: [per purchase and subscription][10] 

The first one is straight-forward
make a sale and get paid 
the full price (if a producer/provider) or a percentage (if a middleman)

The subscription model is getting 
more and more attention 
with all kinds of unlikely businesses applying this (think subscription razors)

The main reason for this shift 
is the predictable [revenue stream][11] and (to an extent) the [counter-cyclicality][12] of subscriptions <sup>[2](#footnote_2)</sup>

Constructing [pricing models][13] for subscription businesses has become [almost a science][14].  
Almost invariably every business offers an initial [freemium][15] tier (to get feet "through the door") and then follows 
a ["Johnnie Walker"][16] pricing structure <sup>[3](#footnote_3)</sup>

### Customer acquisition

A customer is usually considered an asset: "get them through the door and count the money". 
But if acquiring customers is too expensive, then they can become a liability.
The business plan is essentially the complex answer to the following simple equation   
> ACoP = LTV - CAC

where ACoP is "Any Chance of Profitability"

#### CAC

Customer Acquisition Cost
A few [companies out there][17] have such a strong brand that their [CAC][18] is unbelievably close to zero.
The more people buy their product and service, the more they are delighted and spread the word, the more friend they 
tell about: [virtuous cycle][22].  
For everyone else customer acquisition is a hard and expensive business.  
In fact, most startups, whether [B2B][20] or [B2C][21], are just a wealth transfer mechanism: from investors
[to Google and Facebook][19].

How are customers going to be acquired? 
Company will not have Tesla's brand from day 1 
Which channels 

online 
keyword bidding 
PPC costs 
affiliate networks

offline  
cold calling, appointments in-person or in trade shows 
if the business depends on customer volumes (i.e. many little customers than a few big ones) 
how is this going to scale 

#### LTV 

The other side of the equation is the [Lifetime Value][23] of the Customer.

If this is a subscription model, how long is the customer expected to stay loyal?
If a per purchase model, is the customer expected to return and buy again?
How often?

The answer to the LTV question is the correct combination of 
* pricing i.e. how much is the customer expected to pay while transacting with the business, and 
* [customer churn][24], i.e. what probability is there for the customer not returning

Depending on the type of business 
churn's importance can range from critical (e.g. subscription, like Netflix) to irrelevant (e.g. selling low cost items
on eBay)  

### Hiring and costs

without the right people, the job cannot be done
without the right tools the job cannot be done 

Let's start by tools and services
this includes everything from cloud infrastructure 
to payroll software and ISO certification

The same business plan can be capital-intensive 
with costs front-loaded (e.g. purchase of a $5000 server) 
or helping cash-flow (e.g. leasing of the same server for $500/month)
Purchasing rather than leasing/renting is usually a tell-tale sign of a poorly thought bad business  
Unless there is a really good reason, optimising cash-flow [trumps everything else][25] in the list of priorities  

The second important aspect of costs 
sometimes the highest 
is people
Hiring talent is super-important
to deliver on a plan
hire too early and you end up not only wasting money
but time managing and interacting with people who have little to do 
hire too late and you cannot deliver 

New joiners are meant to both drive the milestones in the plan as well as re-act to them
E.g. a new salesperson to drive up customer bookings, new customer support people *after* the bookings have materialized

### Revenue & Projections

In my humble opinion the most important deliverable of this process is the cash-flow spreadsheet
One can be creative with words 
but there is no hiding behind numbers

From a founder's PoV there is bias to action 
and the only resource in abundance is time
so there is a natural tendency to start doing and [figure things later][26] 
This is perfectly fine; it is the doing that brings results, not the thinking per se

From an investor's PoV, though, the cash-flow spreadsheet 
is one of the few ways to truly peer into the company's strategy
This is not b/c it is a crystal ball or b/c everything will go according to plan
It is b/c all of the assumptions, hopes and blind spots have been crystallized in the numbers
If the [burn rate][27] is too large, then revenue targets will be unrealistic in order to cover it
Or perhaps the CAC is incredibly optimistic
Or a crucial expense has not been included (e.g. regulatory)

A careful read and close scrutiny are a much cheaper way of gaging the business' future 
than investing capital and waiting to see how things turn out  

## Runway & Funding rounds 

Few businesses are profitable from the get-go
The rest will need additional funding in order to live another day and keep growing

This introduces us to two important concepts: [runway][28] and [funding rounds][29]

The runway is the length of time a company can continue operating before running out of cash
In plain words it is  
> Runway = cash in the bank / monthly burn rate

If the burn rate cannot be reduced (i.e. expenses reduced or revenue increased), then the [equity][30] needs to be increased 
That is capital in the bank, that is additional funding rounds.

A funding round is a full-time job on its own <sup>[4](#footnote_4)</sup>
The founders need to reach out and have meetings with tens - if not hundreds - of prospective investors.
Prepare performance data reports, legal paperwork, answer questions,...  
This is a process that usually takes a few months to complete.  
As a consequence, during a fund raise, there is reduced ability to look after the business itself 
Therefore this is not something that can just be started on a whim if the runway gets suddenly shortened 
It takes careful financial planning, well in advance

## Footnotes

1. <a name="footnote_1"></a>Another simplistic example.  
The TAM of coffee drinkers around the world is just enormous. But the serviceable and target markets are completely 
different when considering a neighborhood coffee shop and a coffee-at-home subscription service.
2. <a name="footnote_2"></a>In plain words, as a consumer you are more likely to "forget" that you have a subscription 
for something, than if you pay for it each time. This helps smooth out the ups and downs of your personal financial 
situation. It also makes you a more reliable "asset" in the subscription business' books.
3. <a name="footnote_3"></a>Where the bottom tier has just-about-enough features for a lower price (red label) and the 
top tier(s) a full feature set (with diminishing customer value) for a much higher price (blue label). This guides the 
subscriber to the middle option(s), which look like the best value-for-money (black label).
4. <a name="footnote_4"></a>I will try and cover funding rounds in more detail in a subsequent part of this series.
