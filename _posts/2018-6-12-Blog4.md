What role, if any, should zoos play in conservation / education?

Much like with Wapusk National Park, zoos can play a crucial role in conserving animals and providing public exposure. I think that zoos are a more sustainable option when it comes to
conservation since they can fund themselves given proper resources to begin with. However, zoos shouldn't be the main form of conservation. Larger parks are much better since often times, zoos can mismanage animals resulting in loss of lives.

Zoos are an excellent form for education. Children enjoy going to zoos and this can be an opportunity to teach them about animals in danger and how we can help them. Zoos help harness the excitement to transform a field trip into a learning experience.

Is it ethical to keep animals in zoos? If so, what size / type of animal or zoo?

This is a tough question that can only be answered on a case by case basis. However, animals should have large areas to roam around in and some form of entertainment so they don't get bored.
It must also strive to keep the enclosure as similar to the animals natural habitat as possible.

Do you enjoy visiting zoos?

As a child some of my fondest memories were visiting zoos. However, looking back now, those animals were kept in terrible conditions and small enclosures. I also lived near a large national animal sanctuary and would visit the animals in there through safaris and walks.
