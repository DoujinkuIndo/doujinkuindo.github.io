This format is lending itself very well to small updates, so I'll be piecing together the actual pages in the guide section over time, which should keep this less of a time commitment and more of a fun side outlet.

Added an intro to the Quality Statistics guide, which should end up being a pretty good one as I'm using the scripts that will be in there daily for work.

Traveling to Florida this weekend, so hopefully I can keep up with my daily (so far) updates. We'll see! Definitely looking forward to 80 degree weather after a frigid couple of weeks in the DC area. Not especially cold, but enough wind and rain to make it miserable. I'm ready for snow.
