title: Vim Crash Course
---

This is summary of the vim introducation given to my by the lovely Jonathan :blush: Let me make clear from the start, this is not a vim user's guide to vim. This is an oh-crap-some-command-just-dumped-me-into-vim-help! user's guide to vim. There's quite a difference. And if you're wondering, yes, that's happened to me _multiple_ times before.

First thing's first, your panic button: escape. If in doubt, hit escape until you're sure you're out of whatever mode you've got yourself into, then take a deep breath and start over. Unless otherwise stated, this guide assume that you're starting from a nice clean new vim window (which, fyi, you might not have if you've been unexpectedly catapulted into it). Or that you've mashed esc until you have one.

Second key point: everything is case sensitive. Upper and lower case versions of commands tend to do _similar_ things, but they are **not** the same. Pay attention to case, or find youself wondering why you're typing at the end of your file instead of the start.
