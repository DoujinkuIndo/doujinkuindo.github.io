This is the result of blood and sweat of a farmer and tinkerer. I’m pretty happy about this.

The details are written in these previous post
[Make timelapse video of my mini spinach farm using RPi and a Webcam]()
[Camera setting and photo taking schedule to get the best result]()

…and a few more are coming, I just don’t know when.

Here is the gif, enjoy!
