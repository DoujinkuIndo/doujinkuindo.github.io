I have decided to add a page with all the Youtube channels I enjoy, as well as videos. I will try to keep it as manicured as I can. Youtube is an amazing resource. It was what first got me into Computer Science. For a long time, it was the only resource I had to learn Mathematics. Unfortunately it cannot replace a traditional education, ... yet, it is an amazing way to introduce yourself to new concepts.

You can click on the link above, or [here]({{ site.url }}/youtube) to get to the new Youtube page.  
Note I believe a key to effective Youtube videos is excitement, I try to choose videos that can get people excited about topics.
