title: Project\: Adelphi Rate My Professors
---

Rate My Adelphi Professors is a Google Chrome extension adds ratemyprofessors.com ratings to the Adelphi CLASS system, which is what my school uses for course searches and registration.  My goal was to make it more convenient for students to look up the ratings for their professors. Here's what the course search system looks like with my extension loaded:

Students can now get a quick glimpse of the ratings, and click the text to be directly linked to the faculty's page on ratemyprofessors.com.  There is now no need to spend extra time searching through that site as well.

I had a few challenges and roadblocks building this extension. This was my first extension, and my first project using JavaScript that wasn't trivial things like making a nav-bar or a dropdown menu. The learning curve for these two wasn't too bad, but after reading Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts, I really need to go back and refactor a bit.  In order to get the project published in time for registration I worked around some things like callbacks that I didn't quite understand. The result is some serious code smell, something I can't be proud of. I am, however, proud that I published a program that is genuinely useful to other people, and will increase the productivity of students that use it.  Up until this point a lot of the things I've written have had only myself as the user. I won't even get to use this extension as I've already completed my final undergraduate registration, but creating software for others was really satisfying. Getting a facebook message the day after I published with a [bug report](https://github.com/MichaelVessia/adelphi-ratemyprofessor/issues/3) was equal parts frustrating (why didn't I think of that case!) and satisfying (yay, users!). As course registration rolls around again, hopefully more people will start using my extension.

If you're an Adelphi student that would like to download the extension, you can get it from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rate-my-adelphi-professor/iobfioijbmdepcnpmaldbblkbhiceedc).
