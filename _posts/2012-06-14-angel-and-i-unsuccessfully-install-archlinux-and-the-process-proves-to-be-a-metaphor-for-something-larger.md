# Angel and I Unsuccessfully Install ArchLinux, and the Process Proves to be a Metaphor for Something Larger

My friend Angel and I struggled with Archlinux today. For four hours, we wrestled terrible documentation, obscure drivers, and insanely complex CLIs, all trying to get the wireless internet to connect. We never did, and ended up installing boring old Ubuntu instead. The best analogy I have is this: picture a lathe. A lathe is a precisely engineered tool made from hundreds of very very fine parts working in tight unison, designed to create other such fine parts. The question is: how do you make a lathe in the first place? When I was much younger, I couldn't figure out which came first. I saw hammers and nails, but I couldn't figure out how they got tools without tools to begin with. How do you get from sticks and stones to steel and clockwork? I couldn't trace the progression from iron ore to smelting in my mind all at once, and it seemed impossible. Archlinux didn't have the appropriate packages with which to set up the internet, and we couldn't set up the internet and get the packages without the packages. We re-installed Archlinux with the correct packages off the USB, and we still couldn't get it connected. We ended up reinstalling Ubuntu and adding xfce to it to spice up the interface. The machine emerged undamaged, but we made no headway on the problem at hand. It spoke to a larger theme, of distracting myself from the problem at hand with little things; card games, television, plans for reading, doing things from day to day. There are bigger emotions and themes and forces at play in my life this week, and in an effort not to let them control me I may be ignoring them altogether.
