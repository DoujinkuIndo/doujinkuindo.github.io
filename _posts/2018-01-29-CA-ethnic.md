California's ethnic diversity across schools organized by county should make a pretty visual. 

The multiple choice options we provide our students have gone through the following changes over time:

ID | 2009-2016 | 1998-2008 | 1993-1997 | 1981-1992
---|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------
0  | Not reported | | |        
1  | American Indian or Alaska Native, Not Hispanic | American Indian or Alaska Native | American Indian or Alaska Native | American Indian or Alaska Native  
2  | Asian, Not Hispanic | Asian | Asian | Asian
3  | Pacific Islander, Not Hispanic | Pacific Islander | Pacific Islander | Pacific Islander 
4  | Filipino, Not Hispanic | Filipino | Filipino | Filipino 
5  | Hispanic or Latino | Hispanic or Latino | Hispanic or Latino | Hispanic or Latino 
6  | African American, not Hispanic | African American, not Hispanic | Black, not Hispanic | Black, not Hispanic 
7  | White, not Hispanic | White, not Hispanic| White, not Hispanic | White, not Hispanic 
8  | | Multiple or No Response | | 
9  | Two or More Races, Not Hispanic | | | 

While exploring CA Enrollment Data I got this plot:

got me thinking that the stacked bars for each year for every school, clustered by county, might be fun for people from those counties to look at.
