title: Basic Javascript REST API with DB and integration tests Part 1 - Express/Sequelize
---

## Overview

Through this series I intend to explain every step fully, if you follow these steps exactly you will get a working project. However I will also be placing links throughout where you can read up on concepts and programs in more detail. If you are reading this to learn I recommend taking the time to read a little further on each step where you can.

Now onto the details, in this series we will be going through every step required to create a very basic RESTful API that uses:

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the server
* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) for the database set up
* Containerised [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) to conduct API tests

## Thank you's and Sources

At the beginning of this walkthrough I wanted to state my sources and how this article has been put together. As always in the open source world nothing is brand new and everything is iteritive, in this case this walkthrough is an amalgamation of tutorials and articles I found online that helped me build this code from scratch. So thanks to these guys and definitely check their work out if you can.

## Pre-requisites

I will include the versions of the installed software as I write, you should be able to complete the steps on newer versions but be aware that commands/syntax and compatability may change

* Installed Node.JS and NPM - [Installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (Node v16.14.0 & npm 8.3.1)
* Docker - [Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Docker 20.10.11)
* docker-compose - [Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (docker-compose version 1.29.2)
* I recommend an IDE of some sort to help write the code, I am using VSCode - [Installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (1.65.2)
