# Memory and Perception as Time-Dependent Variables: Feedback Loops and the Value of Non-Corporeal Birthday Presents

Beach Day went horribly wrong, but it was absolutely wonderful nonetheless. The rain literally drowned us out. We hopped a train in two directions. Picnic on the floor inside. Dancing naked out in the rain. Big pasta party. Quiet hammock times downstairs. Good jam session. Good stories. Good folks, good friends, and a stack of thoughtful presents. Non-corporeal things. Books, where the ideas matter more than the pages. CDs, the same. Letters, where the letter is incredibly valuable, but the experience of consuming the letter is the present itself. The day kept swerving. It got hot and sticky and annoying, and by the time I was done freaking out about it, it was solved. Cool your head and warm your heart. Don't tell me what to do. I'm realizing how much I'll need to bring to Illinois, if only to lock it in a box in my closet and rarely look at it much. I have parts of my life I'm not willing to rid myself of, and they're all valuable in different ways. I hope I never forget, even the parts I want to.
