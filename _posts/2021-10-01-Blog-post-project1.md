For the project I used the COVID API. I wrote 6 API interaction
functions in order to query the data and pull specific information out
of them. Then I created two new variables in the data set calculating
the percent of confirmed cases by state in the U.S. and the percent of
deaths by state. I created a few contingency tables and numerical
summaries but found that the categorical data supplying the contingency
tables was not very rich. There was no information on demographics or
cities, etc. which limited the tables. Then I created five plots
exploring the data. I found the bar plot with all of the states in the
U.S. chart the most interesting which showed several states with much
higher confirmed cases. Part of this may be an artifact of them being a
larger state but in the case of Texas and Florida these make sense
because of the lax protocols during COVID.


I thought the most difficult thing in the project was connecting to the
API. I first tried with the Pokemon API but could not figure out how to
connect fully. I had an easier time with the COVID data. Once I figured
it out I felt like the rest was a lot easier. In the future, I think I
will join an office hour session if I get stuck on the API or a similar
issue because I would have rather used that data set.
