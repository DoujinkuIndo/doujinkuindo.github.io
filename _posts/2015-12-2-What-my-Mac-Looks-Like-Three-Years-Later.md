title: What my Mac Looks Like: Three Years Later

![2015 UI and Dock setup / 2012 UI and Dock setup](http://d.pr/i/158kf.png)

I’m hardly a fan of Facebook, but today it reminded me of a Mac screenshot I posted three years ago today. I figured why not make it a tradition—even if it doesn’t have to be every year—where I compare what my Mac looks like? So I did.
Certainly, you can see a theme in which apps and type of apps I decide to keep on my dock. At least they are important enough for me to keep there. Typically, I open most apps using the ⌘+Space Bar command. However, I do like to have my options.
There really isn’t a purpose to this post, other than marking a day in history. Maybe I’ll add today on my calendar and look at this again next year. I wonder how things will look then.
