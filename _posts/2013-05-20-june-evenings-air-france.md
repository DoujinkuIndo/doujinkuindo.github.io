# June Evenings — Air France

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqkH9iDxqaI Winters, where work is concentrated, have years of their own — winters exist distinctly, settling into that years' burrow. You hovel up for the winter, enclose yourself with friends and family. But all summers are the same. This is a summer in 2009, connecting genres back and forward in time — modern music that sounds like soul, funk, electronica — timeless, echoing instruments, my soundtrack for many hours of fuddling with programs and machines and tools, of riding the subway and watching things, of trying to deal with sudden bursts of teenage drama. I tie a song to stability (although I know that's not what it's about), and then it holds me down during instability. If I put in the time; if I am true to it, it is true to me.
