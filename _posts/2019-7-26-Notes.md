"No beings to liberate" feels like [a coin lost in the river](/pages/study/zen/coin-lost-river). Once the mind is liberated, that coin, "beings", will be found again.

I think I know what "no beings to liberate" means. Yet, I have no idea what "beings to liberate" means.

On one side, I accept my limitation. I cannot agree, say "yes". On the other side, I don't see my limitation. I cannot disagree, say "no".
