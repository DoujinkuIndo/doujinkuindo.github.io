### What to say about Supergirl?

I was skeptical of this show coming out, since there has never been much of a supergirl, in the shows leads at least.  I was not too sure how it would turn out. 

Despite the show being just like every other super hero show, there was one difference.  The women played the more important roles, most often.  This is very different for super hero style.  Usually, the women take the backseat position, even when it is about them overall.  

Not in supergirl though!  I watched the entire season within days of it being out and it was breath taking.  The way they made her the main character and more importantly the most important character.  There is a difference.  In general, women ran the show, and it was a nice twist from the normal style.  

I can sit here and try to compare supergirl to some woman in my life who changed my life.  But I do not feel that is necessary.  I feel that the sex of the person does not matter.  Just be good and do good. That is how someone becomes a super hero in my life.  Show me that you are not like the rest of the degrading society.  Supergirl was a super hero because she was unique, not just in sense of her powers, but also because of her heart.  Something that all too often, we forget about.  

When no one will be your hero, be your own hero!
