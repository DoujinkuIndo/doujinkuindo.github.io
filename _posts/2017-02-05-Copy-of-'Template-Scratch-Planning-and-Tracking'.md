**Year 7 Scratch Project Handbook**

Before Easter, you will have created your own game using Scratch. (don't worry, you can do it!)

It can be any sort of game you like. Your research should have given you a range of ideas and possibilities. 

Working through this handbook will take you to your solution!

**Step 1 **

Planning

* What is your game about?

* How will you win/lose or start/end the game?

* What needs to be in your game? 

**Step 2**

Designing

* What sprites will you need?

* What resources will you need? 

* What variables/broadcasts/custom blocks?

**Step 3**

Building

* This is the longest stage and will comprise several weeks and homeworks. 

**Step 4 **

Evaluating

* Have you achieved what you designed? 

* Test your game and the games of others.

**Step 5 **

Improving

* Once you receive feedback, what are you doing to do? 

* Make your game better. 

Step 1: Planning

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What is your game about? Name it. Describe the gameplay/how it is played. What is the purpose of the game?
Add a description below to tell me about your game. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The game is a maze where you have to escape the bat and find a way out. My game will be called Scratch vs Predator. You start at the beginning and the first objective is to get through the maze and the second is to escape the bat (predator), if the bat touches you you will lose the game and have to start from the beginning. The bat doesn't race you from the start, half-way through it will come and hunt you down. You have 9 lives.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How will your game be won or lost? 
Make sure you add details here. Be precise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If you get to the end of the maze within the 9 lives you have without being caught by the bat you have won.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What elements need to be in your game? 
Describe/list what might need to be in your game: A fisherman that is trying to hook fish; the basket to land them in, etc. This part needs plenty of detail. Be thorough.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>All sprites, characters, backgrounds and anything else visible in the game will be 2 dimensional because I have tried making it 3 dimensional but it is too hard.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Project Checklist**

**Originality**

Is your project original or a remake of another project?

**Creativity**

Is your project creative and is it different and unique?

**Backgrounds**

Do the backgrounds/stage add to and enhance the product?

 

**Sprites**

Do the sprites/costumes you chose add to and enhance the product?

 

**Scripts**

Do the Scripts make the sprites effectively do what you want them to do? Do you have correct x y coordinates? Do you include "forevers" where needed, etc.

 

**Purpose**

Is the purpose of the product evident to the audience?

 

**User-Friendly**

Is the product user friendly? Did you include notes to help the user know how to manipulate the product?

Step 2: Designing

What Sprites will you need? Describe the Sprite and detail what it will do.
