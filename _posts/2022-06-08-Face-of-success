What does the face of success look like?  
I’m sure the first picture that comes to our mind is that of a person wearing suit, getting down from a shiny car, with millions of people cheering as he/she walks to the stage. I admit, I‘ve dreamt of having it too. But, is that what we are actually seeking for, doesn’t it sound a little lame.  
So, does that mean the filmstars / now in the tech world people working at the FAANG ( or MANGA: not sure whether the buzz word actually got updated) companies  / the cricketers are the only ones who are successful , the only ones who have learned everything in life and therefore granted the right to be rich, famous and called successful?  (I don’t have any problem with people doing these XP , they’ve worked hard to earn the money) . 
The society it is , who decides to appreciate a particular group at a time. Now, for example entrepreneurs are being praised , and being made to look like heros. The problem with the society is that, when we appreciate a certain group of people, we like to place them at the position that looks that they are god, we follow them everywhere, we want to get updates about their daily life, we fix them as eaxmples and someties even walk into doing the wrong things just because they are doing it, and they cannot be wrong. We place high expectations on them, when they do a small act of humanity, we get overwhelmed at how good that person is (when that was just a very humanely act) and we lash them whenever they do a slight mistake. I understand that it a part of being human that we slide in to doing these things without even realizing or thinking much about it, but it is important that we remind ourselves. 

And the people who haven’t had these are a failure for life, they should sit behind, not enjoying and punishing oneself everyday of his life, because he couldn’t achieve all of this.
