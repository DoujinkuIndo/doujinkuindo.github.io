Another successful meetup, featuring Steven Thwaites of Docker, James Munnelly from Jetstack and Karolis Rusenas from StorageOS.

Around a hundred attendees joined me at Skills Matter, our new venue which has very professional AV and a bar.

I welcomed the audience and introduced our sponsors who pay for the meetup.

Everything ran smoothly and we had some excellent questions throughout the talks. Most importantly, there was plenty of networking, especially in the pub afterwards.
