Another successful meetup, featuring Steven Thwaites of Docker, James Munnelly from Jetstack and Karolis Rusenas from StorageOS.

Around a hundred attendees joined me at Skills Matter, our new venue which has very professional AV and a bar.

Everything ran smoothly and we had some excellent questions throughout the talks. Most importantly, there was plenty of networking, especially in the pub afterwards.
