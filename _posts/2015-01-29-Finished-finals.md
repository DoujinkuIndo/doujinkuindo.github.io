title: Finished final exams

I passed my last exam of the fall semester yesterday.
Generally, it was a pretty crazy day and I'm happy it's over.
Today is the premiere of "The Immitation Game" - the new movie about Alan Turing -
in the Czech Republic.
Coincidentally, professor Jack Copeland, the head of [The Turing Archive](http://www.alanturing.net/),
has a talk at my university today.
I even managed to get tickets to see the movie afterwards.
