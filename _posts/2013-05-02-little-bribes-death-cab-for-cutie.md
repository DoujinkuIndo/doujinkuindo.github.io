# Little Bribes — Death Cab for Cutie

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uNZuKCSDtw This affection for music comes and goes in waves. I listen to new music all in rushes; I discover a band and dwell on them for months, and then I reject them and move on. The same for this blog — it's never been reviews, but it's moved away from analysis and journalism into real journaling, a diary of my experiences, a soundtrack; the songs are secondary to my stories. This was the beginning of a new wave. In middle school, I got myself a new album each of Decemberists, Death Cab, Modest Mouse, Counting Crows — I actively decided to sit down and listen to them. A conscious discovery effort. It was new and exciting and I felt full; each new song had a tone I was used to, from the band; it was educated listening, music appreciation rather than intake. This song marks that. I was in Borders, 9th grade, a reunion; I began to realize that I recognized the CDs on the shelves; these weren't new things any more.
