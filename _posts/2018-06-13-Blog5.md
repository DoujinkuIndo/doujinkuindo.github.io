Likes and dislikes about my food system.

Eggs - I love the taste and convenience as a cheap protein source. However, the chickens that lay eggs may be kept in battery cages. [This](https://www.winnipeghumanesociety.ca/animal-issues/farm-animal-welfare/) talks about the terrible conditions of farm animals.

Milk - Healthy source of Vitamin A and protein. However, it has many of the same problems as with eggs, lack of humane treatment of farm animals.

Meat - Mainly pork, some chicken. As college students, when we go shopping for groceries a majority
of the items on our shopping list are added with a strict budget in mind. Pork is one of the cheapest meats and can easily be added to stews, stir fry and soups. And those are just dishes
that start with an 'S'! On the other hand, it is likely that the reason the pork we buy is so cheap is due to factory farming. One of the students in this class has parents that factory farm pigs and I wouldn't be surprised if it's their pork that I buy from Walmart!

The chicken we buy is grass fed which is a good start but unfortunately the high grade organic food is far too expensive for our modest wallets.

Tofu - Easy to incorporate into many different meals
Green vegetables such as spinach and broccoli - easy to cook and goes well with most dishes.
