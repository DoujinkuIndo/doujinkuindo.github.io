Likes and dislikes about my food system.

Eggs - Taste and convenience as a cheap protein source.
     - Chickens that lay eggs may be kept in battery cages
     - [Terrible conditions of farm animals](https://www.winnipeghumanesociety.ca/animal-issues/farm-animal-welfare/)

Milk - Healthy source of Vitamin A and protein
     - Same problem as with eggs, lack of humane treatment of farm animals
     
Main from of meat consumed is pork
Tofu - Easy to incorporate into many different meals
Green vegetables such as spinach and broccoli - easy to cook and goes well with most dishes.
