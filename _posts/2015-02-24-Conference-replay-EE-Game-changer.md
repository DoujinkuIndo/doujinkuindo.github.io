[David Blevins](https://twitter.com/dblevins) is a frenetic actor in the overall Java EE Ecosystem. Over the years, he has been involved in various open source Java EE related projects (e.g. OpenEJB). David is now actively working on [TomEE](https://tomee.apache.org/apache-tomee.html) which he launched in 2011. So it is fair to say that David knows what implementing Java EE means.

In addition, David is involved in different JCP Expert Groups where he is helping to shape the future versions of Java EE. So David has multiple hats: implementor, contributor and active participant in different EGs.

In his JavaOne and Devoxx session, David is sharing, in a technical (and non traditional) way, his enthusiasm about Java EE and the JCP. In the _"Java EE Game Changers"_ talk, David looks back at Java EE, he discusses some aspects that have changed the way we program Java EE applications. David also talks about points such as testability in Java EE. Finally, David is also sharing some of the ideas he is pushing forward, through his involvement in the JCP, to improve Java EE (e.g. MDB replacement in JMS 2.1).

This is great session to watch! This talk is also highly recommended to anyone who still has doubts about the Java EE Platform! The only grief one could do about this session is that one hour is too short for such an enthusiast and knowledgable speaker!
