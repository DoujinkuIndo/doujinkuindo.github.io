# Table Scraps — The Silversun Pickups

BY GRAEME MCGUIRE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qxP_DNdNUQ The word this song always conjures up for me is _anesthetic_ - the muffled drums, their simple beat, the subdued bass, the scattered, yawning guitar notes; if someone set a debilitating hangover to music, I reckon it'd sound like this. The lyrics are tinged with hints of intimate experiences, night terrors and so on - it's hazy semantically too ("remembering, if only barely"), very much like someone piecing The Night Before back together on The Morning After. Stale leftovers, inebriation, fumbling and shadows are all mentioned; the picture is blurry, but the impression is very clear. It's at once an application of Newton's 3rd Law – the opposite-reaction to just about every party song ever – and also a very good musical translation of a particular sensation: emerging from a sort of numbness or stupor, but not quite being there yet.
