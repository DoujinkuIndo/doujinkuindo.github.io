Testing, testing, 1 2 3. Hi! This is going to be a place for me to put updates on personal projects, mostly RPi and Arduino mechatronics builds. 
I'm about to start working on an OpenCV-based motion tracking and laser targeting system, stay tuned for the beginning of the build.
Be wary of the odd cooking post; I'm still learning and make no guarantees of their safety. 
I'm also going to share the odd video/article that I find interesting.
