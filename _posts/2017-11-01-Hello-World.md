Testing, testing, 1 2 3. Hi! This is going to be a place for me to put updates on personal projects, mostly RPi and Arduino mechatronics builds. 
I'm about to start working on an OpenCV-based motion tracking and laser targeting system, stay tuned for the beginning of the build.
I'll also be sharing videos/articles I find interesting, as well as occassionaly using this as a real personal blog.
