2 month unlimited travel pass = $530

after one month:  
Number of trips = 13  
Total time spent travelling = approx 120 hours  
Cost of travel without the pass = $758

Going to be spending a bunch more time on the Greyhound in the next week or two, probably going to do a loop of Canmore > Calgary > Edmonton > Regina > Canmore.
