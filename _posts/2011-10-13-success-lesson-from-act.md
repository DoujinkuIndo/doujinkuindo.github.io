In his article over at the [Software Advice](http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/) blog titled "[The Birth of a Category Known as Contact Management](http://blog.softwareadvice.com/articles/crm/the-birth-of-a-category-known-as-contact-management-1100411/)", Mike Muhney (co-founder of ACT! Software) brings out some history surrounding where ACT! came from.

What struck me was the fact that it was born of a need, a need both he and Pat Sullivan had. It was not born of a thought "what can we make that will make money", but rather, "we need to do x, let's make something that will do x. Hey, other's need it too...".

The first reason why ACT! was successful is because it did the core things that sales people needed.

Mike and Pat sold the sales people of host of laptop makers on the benefit of using ACT!. They then sold it to others.Â Remember, that once you sell a salesperson on an idea, it's incredibly hard to un-sell them on it.

The second reason that ACT! was successful is because the targeted the right niche.

There's a lesson in there for all of us, we need to deliver the core thing that our clients are paying for, and make sure that we are marketing to the right people.
