title: The pots, plant pots
---

You see my plants You see the set up. It’s time for a break from all the techs and reveal the prep process for the mini spinach farm.

**Step 1**: Gather all takeaway boxes you can find. Component list:

1. A spoon, to spoon the soil. It doesn’t matter if it’s plastic or metal
2. A metal fork. It’s extremely important that it’s metal
3. Pots, a lot of pots…with their lids preferably
4. Lighter, you would likely need only one
5. Soil
6. Seeds, or any choice of plants

**Step 2**: You now have to make holes for air ventilation through the soil.

**Step 3**: I thought it would be a good idea to heat up the fork and pierce it though the plastic pots. It’s not too bad an idea.

**Step 4**: Pierce them down. Be careful with the fume, they are not too friendly.

**Step 6**: Upgrade myself to new technology. Basically, I was too stupid and used the lighter and almost burned my thumb. Then I thought to myself there must be a better way. Then I kicked myself because there was actually a better way.
