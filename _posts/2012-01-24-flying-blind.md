By this point I had no idea where I was going or how I was getting there. I was running low on cash, but wanted to spend a couple more weeks in Europe. I had to fly home from Frankfurt, so I wanted to stay in that region of Europe, but I wanted to hang out in places I hadn&#8217;t yet been. And add to that the fact I have an ongoing contest with Damien (at least in my own head) to notch up the most countries visited.

The solution: Austria!

Truth is I was mainly looking for a solution to visiting a new country or two, and while Poland was high on the list, Krakow was just as far as Vienna from Berlin, but starting to get a little far from Frankfurt.

From Berlin I hopped aboard a train travelling via Prague and wound up in Vienna. As I&#8217;ve been doing on a lot of my travels in the past year or so, I rocked up with pretty much no clue about the city, save for Sch_ö_nbrunn Palace and I only know about that because of an Andre Rieu DVD (that&#8217;s the kind of stuff you become well acquainted with, working at a record label).

So as you do, I pretty much headed straight to the only place in town I knew of. And man is it impressive! Honestly, it seemed like _just another palace_ from the front, but it was all kinds on crazy awesome once you went around back. Huge gardens, massive water features, faux Roman ruins, the worlds oldest zoo and a labyrinth to boot! You don&#8217;t have to spend a dime to enjoy walking around the joint (although you can go on tours into the palace, the zoo has an entry fee etc).

Wikipedia also has a few other kick ass pictures [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Schloss_schoenbrunn_hdr_panorama.jpg/1000px-Schloss_schoenbrunn_hdr_panorama.jpg "schonbrunn") and [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Wien_Panorama.jpg/1000px-Wien_Panorama.jpg).

Keeping in the spirit of the musical history Vienna is so rich in, I headed for a hardcore gig to see a couple of Australian bands, 50 Lions and Hopeless. Tiny venue, it was basically a cramped cellar underneath a trendy restaurant. Good times were had. While it was indeed small in there, it was still a decent turnout and the kids seemed stoked on it all.

Also regarding Vienna&#8217;s music scene, they&#8217;re very big on Mozart. They&#8217;ll show you anything and everything related to the Austrian Pianist, they&#8217;ll even try and sell you his balls.

During my brief time in Vienna I headed out to the Wurstelprater (amusement park) which in itself is little more than any old amusement park, but it is home to a micro nation known as the Republic of Kugel Mugel (roughly translated as &#8220;Spherical Hill&#8221;). Long story short, dude built a house that he didn&#8217;t have approval for, local authorities tried to order its demolition, dude tried to declare it a new country and succeed from Austria. Kinda funny, kinda idiotic. Get the full story [here](http://atlasobscura.com/place/republic-kugelmugel "kugelmugel").

As it turns out, Bratislava, is not even a two hour train ride from Vienna. Seizing the opportunity, I proceeded to check off another country with a day trip to the Slovakian capital. I don&#8217;t know what was going on, but it seems as if absolutely nothing was going on. Like a lot of European cities it has a small old town and an adjacent castle on a hill, but beyond that it didn&#8217;t seem like there was much to see, and most places seemed to be pretty well shut anyway. No regrets on making the trek, but I probably won&#8217;t be heading back in a hurry anytime soon.
