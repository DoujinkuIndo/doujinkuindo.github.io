## Footnotes

1. <a name="footnote_1"></a>To use an analogy from [part 1][1].
2. <a name="footnote_2"></a>In the olden days, banks would send a telegraphic message and later Telex.  
In the modern day, for all that we know, RedBank may be employing a person to just press [Ctr+F5][7] 
all day, to see new credits in their nostro account. 
3. <a name="footnote_3"></a>Which means that by giving money to account E, RedBank did not just "magic" some money up.  
It just counter-balanced its newly acquired asset (money in its PurpleBank account), with a liability (giving money to E). 
So, all is zero in the end. 
4. <a name="footnote_4"></a>If PurpleBank proves to be dodgy and its deposits evaporate, then RedBank's asset (their 
account in PurpleBank) is worth nil and has to be written off.  
5. <a name="footnote_5"></a>For example, the Spanish buying more German cars than the Germans [jamon iberico][20]. 
6. <a name="footnote_6"></a>Being placed under sanctions goes beyond financial transactions. Any part of the [US 
infrastructure][45] from SWIFT message processing to mail servers etc is blocked for entities considered adversaries. 
And this can increasingly be anyone.
7. <a name="footnote_7"></a>The mandate is the equivalent of C declaring "Please allow A to take (debit) from my account 
in PurpleBank every X days and deposit it in her account in GreenBank". 
8. <a name="footnote_8"></a>In a "normal" push payment it is first debit (from the payer) and then credit (to the payee).  
In direct debit, it is first credit (to the payee) and then debit (from the payer), or at the very least these 2 happening 
almost in parallel. 
9. <a name="footnote_9"></a>Full disclosure: I am an employee of GoCardless, an online direct debit provider, at the 
time of writing this blog post. 
10. <a name="footnote_10"></a>Debit and credit cards have no practical difference in this discussion.
11. <a name="footnote_11"></a>This used to be exclusively the remit of the Acquiring banks. But as technology and terminals 
started becoming more advanced, it becomes harder and harder for "generalists" (as the banks are) to compete. Hence the 
rise of dedicated processors. 
12. <a name="footnote_12"></a>When mentioning 'Apple' in this section, I refer to Apple, Google, Samsung,... 
13. <a name="footnote_13"></a>Hard to make sense, I know! I had to re-read that myself... :-/
