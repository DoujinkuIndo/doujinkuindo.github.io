# Lover's Lane — Squirrel Nut Zippers

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ssP8Uy0QI Senior year, midtown, 34th street and eighth avenue, maybe — industrial area, near the bus terminal and the subway junctions, old shipping docks and new porn stores, there's a little swing dance place two flights up with a view over the nighttime Hudson. I'd just begun to do swing dance in public, coerced and convinced and encouraged and finally broken through the fear and apprehension into social dance, thrilled, walking to the subway, riding home with a joy in my heart, listening to SNZ, dancing all along the street, a thursday night with school the next day, it's 1am, but I didn't care — I'd found it.
