We had three fantastic speakers from esynergy, ControlPlane, and Sysdig joining our June Cloud Native London meetup - our first in person since March 2020! We also had virtual attendees joining us via Rambly and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Chris Nesbitt-Smith from esynergy with a fun and lively discussion on Policy as [versioned] code (starting at [15:38](https://youtu.be/kujkYxU8HoM?t=938)). He talked about how:

* Policy often causes more harm than good, is slow to update, exemptions are harder still to manage, measuring compliance at scale is nigh on impossible.
* Throwing some curly braces at a problem is not the solution. Policy if it is articulated as code, needs to embrace all the best practices of code.
* Purposeless policy is potentially practically pointless. (now say it 5 times quickly)

Then we had Ric Featherstone from ControlPlane who told us to Throw Away Your Passwords: Trusting Workload Identity (starting at [52:59](https://youtu.be/kujkYxU8HoM?t=3179)). His takeaways mentioned that: 

* You can use Kubernetes as an Identity Provider for services outside of your cluster
* Restrict the usefulness of compromised ServiceAccount Tokens by using Bound Service Account Tokens
* Start to look at TPMs and TEEs for Hardware Roots of Trust

Finally we had Bruno Silva from Sysdig who wrapped up our evening with a talk on Cloud-Native Runtime Security with Sysdig & Falco (starting at [1:36:08](https://youtu.be/kujkYxU8HoM?t=5768)). His takeaways talked about: 

* Using Containers can bring some drawbacks concerning Security.
* Vulnerability management can't avoid 0 Day's threads.
* Using as a source of truth (Kernel, Cloud API logs, K8s Audit), tools like Falco can give you real-time information. 

And of course, a group photo from Rambly!
