# In Which a Storm Approaches: Minimalism as the Foremost Expression of Ennui, and Other French Words

There's a struggling emptiness here, balanced between idealistic minimalism and just terrible abject horror, something absolutely awful that drives me to clean out my hard drives and my shelves, to erase texts and rid myself of ties to the world; overpowering, but never quite overpowering enough to silence the little guilt in the back of my head, whispering — you may regret this in a little while — but I do it still. And for people, the same; I can cut ties slowly, not respond to calls or texts or messages, convince myself that bridges need to be burned, lest I sink beneath their weight, but it never seems to help, only hurt. Can I become more distant? Can I cut my ties entirely, go away to college fresh and new and empty and hollow, ready to fill myself with a new life, or, worse, left hanging without one? I'll bring my music and my movies, my trillions of photos and recordings online and on hard disk, a Nook full of the books of my lifetime, but can I pare down what it is I own, the physical objects I bring? And will I feel new and ready to start again, or will I feel empty and alone and horrible? And there's this notion, enjoy the silence; like just by saying _it'll all be okay _I ought to believe you; you've been through things before and you're fine, my things must seem unimportant. But it never seems that way. And there's a storm coming. That's not even a metaphor. Can I leave the house today with a little bag full of electrics and some cash, and return tonight the same person? Or will I have left a part of myself wherever it is I end up? But it is minimalism; to only use minimalist writers, to try and operate through terminal, to want to code the html for my own sites myself, to run my own resume, to do my own work, to be left to my own devices; these are things I want only momentarily. But I try them and I am disappointed nearly instantly; I need the support for coding, I need the community for engineering, I need my friends to live. My own devices are weak from inexperience. Do I work without them or do I use them as long as I can, before they leave me?
