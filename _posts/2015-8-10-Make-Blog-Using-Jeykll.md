title: Hi and welcome to my tutorial of building a blog with jeykll !!!
---

In this post i will explain how i created a blog using Jeykll. I was bored of using Wordpress and other blogging websites so i decided to migrate from Wordpress to Github pages using Jekyll. Basically jekyll seemed like a great alternative and the entire blog is a set of static files , pretty sefe no? hahaha... Also GitHub provides free hosting for Jekyll blogs so i can save some money !!! 



<br><b>1.Getting Started</b></br>
So instead of reading entire documentation we will start by forking a repository. This will save a lot of time and effort. Visit the following link : <i>https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now</i> and top right corner click on the fork button to copy the blog theme to your GitHub account.
<br><b>2.Host on GitHub pages</b></br>
As you are GitHub user you can make use of one free "user website", which will work on <i>http://yourusername.github.io</i>. This is pretty amazing !!! Now quickly click on the "Setting" button in your newly forked repository and change the repository name to "yourusername.github.io" using your GitHub username . Your website will go live immediately !!
We are doing awesome work till now but let customize our website ....
<br><b>3.Website Customization</b></br>
Open "_config.yml" file and modify your website name, description , links to social networking accounts etc...Don't forget to commit the changes :D
Fine we are doing great but how will we publish our first blog post ????
<br><b>4.First Blog Post here we come !!!</b></br>
Open and edit "/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md" and write your own content and save it. Change the file name to todays date and edit the title of your post. Default structure of the file will be <i>year-month-day-title.md</i> 
You can also create a new blog posts on GitHub directly by clicking the "+" icon in "/_posts". Dont forget to name the file correctly.
<br><b>Optional Steps</b></br>
You can use various themes to make your blog look more pretty . If you want to enable Disqus Comments on the blog then modify the file "_layouts/default.html" after that you can go to your Disqus account and they will provide you all the necessary code to set up the comments. 
Apart from that you can also enable Google Analytics on the website. Just register your website through Google Analytics and then google will provide you javascript tracking code to embed on website.
<br><b>So these are some cool things that you can do to setup your own personal blog . If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask me either on comments or you can send me email, tweet me ... i will answer them :D</br></b>

Bonjour !
