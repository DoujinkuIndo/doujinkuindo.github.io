# Testify — Xaphoon Jones (Radiohead X Kanye West)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz-8B6pl19g These are figureheads, Kanye West and Thom Yorke; men revered for their outward appearance, a carefully cultivated pop-culture balancing act between not caring how one is perceived and very, very much caring. Kanye is more _braggadocio_, and Thom is more _punk-rocker_ in attitude, but together they complement each other; the fierce, unrepentant timbre of Kanye West and the smooth-at-first but abrasive, jangly ballads of Radiohead; they build a complete, cohesive world where the two have always coexisted together. And Kanye's _Touch The Sky_ is about death and achievement and human ambition, and Radiohead's _Reckoner_ is about death and some of these same things; they're sister works, both products of the same mindset in modern society, written by famous, wealthy men who feel some factor of discontent._ _
