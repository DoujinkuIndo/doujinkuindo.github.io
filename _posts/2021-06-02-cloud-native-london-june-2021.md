We welcomed three fantastic speakers from Shipa, Suade Labs, and Kasten by Veeam via Zoom, Rambly, and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams for our June Cloud Native London virtual meetup.

We are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [UMATR](https://www.umatr.io/), and [Kasten by Veeam](https://www.kasten.io/veeam) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Our first speaker was Michael Cade from Kasten by Veeam kicking us off for the evening with a discussion of Kubestr: Identify, Validate and Evaluate your Kubernetes Storage (starting at [31:44](https://youtu.be/aWd8exV7exE?t=1904)). His takeaways mentioned:

* Open-Source project that enables better visibility into your Kubernetes storage options and making sure that your storage is optimal for your workload but also so that you are not wasting resources which will cost you money: Identify the various storage options present in a cluster.
* CSI is a growing way to standardise on your Kubernetes storage, making sure that you are able to Validate if the storage options are configured correctly is a must. Specifically around data management, volume snapshots are key to any real data management progress within Kubernetes and stateful data.
* Performance requirements do not go away even in Cloud-Native. We might know what our requirements are around users, workload, type of IO pattern but do we know how that correlates to the storage options that we have available in Kubernetes? On top of that is an overwhelming amount of storage variations out there especially and even more so with the public cloud. Evaluate the storage using common benchmarking tools like FIO.

He also include a link for a free ebook: [https://www.kasten.io/kubecon/quick-start-kubernetes-challenge](https://www.kasten.io/kubecon/quick-start-kubernetes-challenge)

Next up was Hubert Bosiacki from Suade Labs, discussing Software License and DevOps (starting at [59:59](https://youtu.be/aWd8exV7exE?t=3599)). His takeaways are:

* Always make sure your code have a licence.
* Always check licence of dependencies in your project.
* Add policy and licence checker to your automated pipeline.

Finally, after a short break to hang out with our fellow techies, we returned with Viktor Farcic from Shipa, who wrapped up our evening talking about how Developers Do Not Need Kubernetes (starting at [1:43:29](https://youtu.be/aWd8exV7exE?t=6209)). He talked about: 

* Managing Kubernetes resources is hard and requires people dedicated to Kubernetes.
* Developers want to define and deploy applications, and not Kubernetes resources.
* Shift-left requires simplification of the operations.

And of course, our usual group photo from Rambly!
