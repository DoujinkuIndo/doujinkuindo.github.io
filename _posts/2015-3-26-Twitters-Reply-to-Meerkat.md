title: Twitter's Reply to Meerkat
---

We’ve seen a lot of praise the live streaming service Meerkat, since its premiere at SXSW this month. It’s been an obvious threat to Twitter, as Twitter has attempted to even block the app ([Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/14/meerkat-cut-off-from-twitter/)). For those of you who aren’t familiar with Meerkat, the idea of the app is rather simple. You log into using your Twitter account, type in a short message—less than 140 characters—and tap either “schedule” or “stream.” The app then allows you to instantly stream whatever your phone’s camera sees over the web, while simultaneously posting your message and a link to the feed to Twitter.

Today, Twitter launched Periscope. Last week, Titter [confirmed](https://twitter.com/periscopeco/status/576429747057504257) the purchase of a startup company called Periscope, whose focus was on live streaming. While the app takes a similar approach to live streaming as Meerkat, it will be interesting to see what type of real competetion Meerkat will see from Periscope.
