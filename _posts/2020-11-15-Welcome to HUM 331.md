Welcome to HUM 331/HIS 336! This semester we're going to undertake a journey through the history of communications technologies, from ancient Sumer to the modern Twitterverse. In addition to this journey through the past, you'll also be learning how our latest communications technology--digital technology--is shaping how historians engage with the past. This is our course website where you'll post digital assignments and your final project to share with your classmates. You'll access this site via our class repository in GitHub, which means you'll need to register for a GitHub account (they're free) if you haven't already. If you don't know what a GitHub is, don't worry--we'll go over first steps in class. For more information on the course and to view the syllabus, navigate to the Course Description page. Looking forward to a great semester!
