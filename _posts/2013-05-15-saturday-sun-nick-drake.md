# Saturday Sun — Nick Drake

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXLWH2IAEN0 This, another song tied irrevocably to a summer and a place and a mood; I played this song on a grand piano in the empty main lounge of a hall in upstate New York; I imagined the campus in the 1960s; the vibraphones fit right in. The summer sunlight streaming in wide through the windows, and it had such _mood_, the perfect bildungsroman. It transcended era, it transcended angst or depression; I didn't care about Nick Drake's history. I cared about my own, and the song was a blank canvas for me to map out my life thus far on; to figure out who I was, what I wanted, where I was going. This was the first song I ever recorded; on a friend's iPhone, with a good microphone. Sent online, bounced off an email server and played in secret, very late at night, for a confidential opinion.
