Greetings Traveller.

Today in this blog I will attempt to tackle one of the more abstract skills I have been tasked with learing for this course, visual representation of texts. 

As I write this blog I am watching the referenced episode of Archer from John Laudun's blog (I highly reccomend watching it, its pretty good).  I bring this up bacause the episode, "El Contador" is heavily influenced by Richard Connell’s short story “The Most Dangerous Game.”  This and many other shows have taken to referencing classic texts or using them as sources of inspiration.  This phenomenon of taking older works of literature and working them into pop culture media to appeal to newer generations is nothing terribly new, I have listed some of them below.

Apocalypse Now – Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness set during the Vietnam War

Castle in the Sky - steampunk cartoon loosely based on the Laputa subplot from Gulliver's Travels

Independence Day (1996 film) - H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds

Frozen - inspired by Andersen's Snow Queen, set in a generic Scandinavian country in the late 19th century

Gnomeo and Juliet – a self-referential adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet wherein the main characters are enlivened statues in two adjacent garden displays in modern England

Sherlock – Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series, now set in modern 2010's London with the main characters utilising modern technology such as the internet and smartphones. Watson is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick.

The Lion King – William Shakespeare's Hamlet as an animal fable

'* For the full list refer to the wikipedia link in the works cited

With about 99.99% certainty I can say that anyone who reads this will either recognize or know the majority of the modern versions I have listed.  However, I cannot say the same for their classical counterparts.  I feel that the reson for this discrepancy is a result of the method in which each is conveyed to the viewer.  For instance The Lion King, parrallels William Shakespeare's Hamlet almost perfectly when regarding plot points.  So why is it that people would rather watch The Lion King than read Hamlet?  The answer, visual representation.  The method that the story is delivered in is much easier to understand and
