Greetings Traveller.

Today in this blog I will attempt to tackle one of the more abstract skills I have been tasked with learing for this course, visual representation of texts. 

As I write this blog I am watching the referenced episode of Archer from John Laudun's blog (I highly reccomend watching it its pretty good).  I bring this up bacause the episode, "El Contador" is heavily influenced by Richard Connell’s short story “The Most Dangerous Game.”  This and many other shows have taken to referencing classic texts or using them as sources of inspiration.  This phenomenon of taking well known works of literature and working them 

"Apocalypse Now"(and its remake) was based on Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness

As for "Doctor Who," the previous doctor (David Tennant) actually visited William Shakespeare in one episode that revealed how Shakespeare got his inspiration for many of his famous works and lines.
