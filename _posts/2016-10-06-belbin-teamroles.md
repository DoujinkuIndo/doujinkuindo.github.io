title: What Belbin Team Roles Do I Best Fit Into?
---
Based on self-assessment, I believe I fit into the following [Belbin Roles](http://www.belbin.com/about/belbin-team-roles/).

## Teamworker

Help the team to gel, using their versatility to identify the work required and complete it on behalf of the team

<ul>
  <li><b>Strengths</b>: Co-operative, perceptive and diplomatic. Listens and averts friction</li>
<li><b>Allowable weaknesses</b>: Can be indecisive in crunch situations and tends to avoid confrontation</li>
<li><b>Don't be surprised to find that</b>: They might be hesitant to make unpopular decisions</li></ul>

## Completer Finisher

Most effectively used at the end of tasks to polish and scrutinise the work for errors, subjecting it to the highest standards of quality control.

<ul>
  <li><b>Strengths</b>: Painstaking, conscientious, anxious. Searches out errors. Polishes and perfects.</li>
  <li><b>Allowable weaknesses</b>: Can be inclined to worry unduly, and reluctant to delegate.</li>
  <li><b>Don't be surprised to find that</b>: They could be accused of taking their perfectionism to extremes.</li>
</ul>
