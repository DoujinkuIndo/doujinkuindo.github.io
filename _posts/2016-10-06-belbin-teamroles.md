![Completer Finisher](http://www.belbin.com/media/1318/completor.png) Completer Finisher

Most effectively used at the end of tasks to polish and scrutinise the work for errors, subjecting it to the highest standards of quality control

**Strengths**: Painstaking, conscientious, anxious. Searches out errors. Polishes and perfects

**Allowable weaknesses**: Can be inclined to worry unduly, and reluctant to delegate

**Don't be surprised to find that**: They could be accused of taking their perfectionism to extremes
