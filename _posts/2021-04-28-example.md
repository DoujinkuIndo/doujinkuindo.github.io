Good morning sleepy!
It's an excellent day for poetry
And living with ADD
And chronic pain yippee
 

![I look at the blank ceiling when I wake up, with it's white textured pattern and white frosted glass light fixture, because if I look around and see mess I will feel guilty about how much there is to do and panic and not be able to get out of bed for half an hour because I can't figure out what to do first.](../images/Good morning_Wed_28_Apr_2021_06_11_00_-0500_captioned.jpg)

I can't remember
One whole stanza
From one moment
To the next
Time to check
If notifications
are a fix 

![Still looking at the ceiling, deliberately ignoring everything accept trying to fix the problem of not being able to remember what I just said in my tweet in order to be able to record it.](../images/Fixing workflow_Wed_28_Apr_2021_06_20_17_-0500_captioned.jpg)

Time to go with the obvious solution: go get my other camera phone and take a picture of the tweet as I make it so that I don't have to remember

One of the features of living with ADHD is that you end up bug fixing your blog post process before can you put pants on for the morning. Priorities are not a thing. 

![I have achieved pants with bonus socks.  They are blue jeans and gray wool socks.  Next I play on hard mode and go for a shirt. Pictured is a leg dressed in blue jeans and a foot dressed a sock.](../images/Bug fixing_Wed_28_Apr_2021_06_34_07_-0500_captioned.jpg)

In the past half hour, I have mysteriously acquired a shirt, shoes, coffee, and listened to three songs.

Time to start noticing things. I notice a lot of crumbs or on my kitchen. Since they're dirty and not just messy, cleaning up the crumbs is first to do.

Cats fed. Come back to tidying up crumbs. But there's a lot of clean dishes mixed in, so it makes sense to empty the dish drainer first.

Rolling right along with an empty drainer

As I go along, it's important to remember to pat myself on the back for every little achievement. If I congratulate myself for what I am doing instead of focusing on how much there is to be done, everything goes a lot better. 

![An empty drainer and a full sink. It is important to concentrate on being proud of the empty drainer instead of panicking about the full sink.](../images/Congratulate yourself_Wed_28_Apr_2021_07_21_38_-0500_captioned.jpg)

I have aquired a full dish drainer again, by moving all of the dirty dishes through my sink and the cleaning process into the drainer.  Go me! There was also an interlude where I delivered crumbs to the chickens and petted the low rooster in the pecking order for five minutes so he would calm down and stop attacking me.

If I get rid of distractions, it's easier to notice things. Getting rid of the piles of dirty dishes makes it easier to notice crumbs on the counter top.

It's important to practice being pleased with a process rather being pleased with an outcome. If I delay being happy until after hi complete a task, I practice being angry and self judgmental call throughout the task and it is nearly impossible to switch to being pleased when the task is done instead I took another task and go for it. However, if I practice being pleased at the process, And encouraging myself, I get to be pleased immediately and stuff feels like it magically gets done. 

![I am very pleased to be cleaning up after last night can of cranberry orange wheat beer and nonalcoholic pineapple mango sour ale. And the bowl of cereal.

One of the challenges of tending to an apartment it's so far today I probably touched removed at least 100 things, and on bad days everyone of those touches send a shooting pain up my right hand into my shoulder. Fortunately today is a good day. I am and fortunately I was able to spend the last week programming this documentation process so that writing captioning and taking these pictures does not involve me touching anything or having to think too hard about it. 

![It looks like an ordinary hand, but in fact it is a fiendish torture device that tempts me to use it because I can use it to get stuff done, and immediately penalize me when I use it with pain. It's a trap.](../images/Pain_Wed_28_Apr_2021_08_29_37_-0500_captioned.jpg)

The next thing I can deal with is my burn bucket. All of this is fire starter for the furnace, but I've been avoiding packaging it and just been stuffing more and more paper into. I need to take it out and put it in plastic bags.

This clean bathroom floor is brought to you by the podcast seen and not heard.

It is far easier to clean when there is something else taking my attention off upsetting about cleaning.
