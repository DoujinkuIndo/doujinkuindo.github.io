When I was a kid, my parents would send me to church camp almost every day. At the camp, we did typical campy-type stuff like singing around campfires or listen to stories. Of course, being a church camp, these songs and stories were often biblical and faith-based.

One particular story I remember involved a die-hard Christian stranded in his house in the middle of a huge flood (not Noah's flood, more like Katrina flood). The characters in this story are the Christian, car driver, boater, and helicopter pilot. The dialog went like this:

> Christian: (Praying) Lord, I've been faithful to you my whole life. Please rescue me!
>
> Driver: (knocks on the door) Hey! The place is flooding! Let's go!
>
> Christian: Go on without me! I will trust in the Lord to rescue me!
>
> Later, the streets are completely flooded. The boater stops by:
>
> Boater: C'mon! We have to go! There's no other way out!
>
> Christian: Go on without me! I will trust in the Lord to rescue me!
>
> Later, the Christian is on his roof, the only place left that not under water. A helicopter flies by.
>
> Pilot: C'mon! There's no way to survive, let's go!
>
> Christian: Go on without me! I will trust in the Lord to rescue me!
>
> The water continues to rise. Eventually, the Christian, caught up in his prayer, drowns. He is now in heaven standing in front of God.
>
> Christian: God Almighty! Why did you not try to save me?
>
> GOD: What do you mean not try? I sent three people!

Until next time
