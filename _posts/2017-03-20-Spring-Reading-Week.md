Some friends and I went skiing at Mont Tremblant in Quebec this past spring reading week.

<!--halt-->

I am not a very good skier; Mont Tremblant is great for skiing. I wanted to do something for
the break and while I had not skiied in years, I knew it would still be a fun trip.

We went for 3 days, with another on each end for the 6-7 hour drive from Waterloo. There were 4 of
us, all with our own gear, so we had borrowed a van to fit everything and got underway Friday morning.

We had rented a nice Airbnb about 45 minutes from the slopes. The kitchen and dining room were far too nice for the basic meals we had planned, and we found
that at the end of a day of skiing all we wanted to do was collapse into some couches.

The directions to the homely cottage took us along some winding roads
flanked by high snowbanks on either side. We were glad we made it there before it got dark, out of concern for icy conditions and getting lost in the dark.

We made a point to get an early start the following morning in order to get a lot of quality ski time in and avoid the long lines. The first day there were some
flurries throughout the day and vision was considerably reduced at the top of the mountain.

This was the day where I found out I had never become very good at skiing, and I quickly abandoned the idea of sticking with my friends who were all much more experienced. I
think I fundamentally don't enjoy going very fast, not only in skiing, but biking and other potentially fast-moving sports as well. That's fine by me, but it made keeping up
with the rest of the group difficult and uncomfortable.

In the end I decided to do the easier runs and get used to the sport again. This mentality carried with me into the second day, which was probably my favorite of the three.

The temperature was around 0c and it was a clear, sunny day. I learned that day that you can get from the top of the mountain to the bottom doing easy runs and I opted to accept
my beginner status and take those routes. I had fun doing them, and felt like I had improved over the course of the day.

In the evening we went out for food in the nearby town to our cabin. While the cabin itself was quaint and made us feel like we very secluded, we were only about a 15 minute drive away from a number of stores and restaurants where we would go out for food and supplies.

By the third day we were all very tired and sore but we got out early and put in a final full day at the slopes. I ended the day trying some of the slightly more challenging runs with my friends and found that I am, after three days of skiing, still bad at skiing.

I think I fell the most of the entire trip in the last half hour when we down the hills together following the best route back to the van.

Had a great time overall and would gladly go skiing again.
