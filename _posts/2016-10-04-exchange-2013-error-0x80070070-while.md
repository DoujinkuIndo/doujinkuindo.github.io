<span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">Solution: I was attempting to remotely add the DAG member from the ECP on my workstation. I logged into the server and found that the system drive was nearly full (&lt;100MB free). Luckily this mailbox server was a virtual machine, and I was able to quickly expand the drive using VMM. After doing this I was able to successfully add the mailbox server to the DAG. </span></span>
