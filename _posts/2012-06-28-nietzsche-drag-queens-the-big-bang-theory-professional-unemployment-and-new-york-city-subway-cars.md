# Nietzsche Drag Queens: The Big Bang Theory, Professional Unemployment, and New York City Subway Cars

Subway adventures again. Damn, I'm gonna miss the city. Not one but two separate drag queens. One had red hair and pumps and was singing. The other had a bass guitar and was reading a book byÂ Nietzsche. An unemployed man performed in my car. He sang (and stomped) a song he'd written the day before about his wife and three kids. Very talented. Nobody gave him money. A girl on the subway next to me discovered that the G train is a real thing. I told her I had only discovered that there was a Z train from the Jay-Z Wikipedia article. A guy on the subway felt the need to recount to his son and (brother?) not only the entire show bible (character descriptions, background, setting) but also the specific details of a particular episode of The Big Bang Theory. Hell on Earth. I can only hope the people in my classes at Illinois will be as incredibly colorful.
