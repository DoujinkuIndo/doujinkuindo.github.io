# How To Fall: Air Mattresses, Maturity, and Proper Advantage

I walked out to check where the car was tonight. It was cold and gorgeous and breezy and the stars were out and my neighborhood seemed small and pretty. I think I'm going to miss it a little. I never really did take proper advantage of it. Oh, I'll be back, but it'll never really be the same. Seven years forms your personality, Thirteen forms your maturity, and Eighteen your responsibility. I practiced HTML/CSS all day today. Maybe it was out of fear, hearing of unemployed or unemployable cousins and wanting a job, and a good one. Maybe some spending money at college, working on a laptop an hour a week or so. Maybe I just want skills to be proud of. My mother fell down today. Tripped on an air mattress and went on the floor. I've never seen anyone so patient to get up. She knew she would, and she knew she could. But it would help her more to relax there on the floor, rather than recover her dignity and stand and resume work. And she healed faster, the bruise lessened, and she got up eventually fully healed. When I fall - and, rest assured, I will - I want to fall like that. With barely half a mind for what people think of me, resolute in the knowledge that whatever I do will help me, and knowing I'll be fine.
