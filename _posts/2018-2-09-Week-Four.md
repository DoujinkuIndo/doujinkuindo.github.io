title: Week 4
---

Yes, it has been a long time since my last "week" of code. No I am not starting over for the 100th time, even though I should.  I am, however, starting something new.  I will be joining a 3 week "mini-bootcamp" by [Lambda School][1] which started on Monday, Feb 5 2008.

Day 1: Lesson 1 starts us off with [Git Fundamentals][2].  This was a quick refresher course on some basic terminal commands that would be used most commonly.
