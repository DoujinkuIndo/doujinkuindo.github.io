title: Week 4
---

Yes, it has been a long time since my last "week" of code. No I am not starting over for the 100th time, even though I should.  I am, however, starting something new.  I will be joining a 3 week "mini-bootcamp" by [Lambda School][1] which started on Monday, Feb 5 2008.

# Completed Items this week

Day 1: Lesson 1 starts us off with [Git Fundamentals][2].  This was a quick refresher course on some basic terminal commands that would be used most commonly.

Day 2: Lesson 2 brings us to [HTML/CSS Fundamentals][3]. General layout for HTML and CSS discussed and a general page created following some guidelines in the `./Lesson2-HTML-CSS/homework/homework-readme.txt` file.

Day 3: Lesson 3 introduces [Intermediate CSS][4].  This lesson is focused on positioning, display properties, and the introduction to Flexbox. Course work instructions found in `./Lesson3-CSS-Positioning/homework/homework.html`.

Day 4: Lesson 4 is a [Introduction to JavaScript][5].  Things start to get more fun as we play with some basic manipulation of variables and operators. It is worth noting that both extra credit sites were super fun to go through. I strongly encourgage you to check out [codepip][6] and "play" [Flexbox Froggy][7] or [CSS Grid Garden][8].

Weekend: New class, new rules.  Now I continue Friday - Sunday as "off time" to do any random task(s) that I wish.  Ideally some time will be spent with some Javascript research.

## Continual work/forward plans

- Lessons 5-8 of the [Lambda School][1] precourse.
- Tweek personal portfolio items, maybe test out Flexbox in the design?
