I found this lesson really interesting and one of the things we looked at was photoshop and how people (especially woman, a case of institutionalized sexism) want to look perfect and on beauty magazines almost all photos of ripped men or fit women are photoshopped but people strive to look like that not knowing they are buying into the trap of doing anything to look like that image they don't know is computer generated and will do anything to get there, advertisers are clever and use the fact that the consumer will do anything to look good to their advantage. We also discussed how if an advert was stereotypical or racist towards blacks or asians, everyone would notice and shame it, rightly so, but when they do it towards gingers or Americans no-one takes notice of it and this is institutionalized racism that goes over everyoneâ€™s head.
