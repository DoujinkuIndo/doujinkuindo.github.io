What Mr Keen discussed with us was about the media, and he spoke about how we shouldn't believe everything told to us and simple ways to filter the truth from the lies, a good example is the 'Winx club’, it’s a internet club for kids that is about believing in fairies (innocent enough), but to get closer to the fairies (or something along those lines) you should go to the kitchen at night, turn on the gas, make a wish and light a match. Impressionable 6 year olds will most likely do this but if they just thought about it for a second it doesn’t take a genius to figure out it is a stupid idea. Several people have died and been injured by this because obviously they get seriously burned, if they simply didn’t believe everything they’re told it wouldn’t be such a big issue.
