# Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors — Radiohead

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9L5zbaQML0 MOMA, 8th grade. I've just had a music dump from my cousin Derek, full of Radiohead and Counting Crows, the albums _Amnesiac_ and _August and Everything After_. My family and I are at the museum, looking at weird modern art, the kind that matches the album art; this song comes on and I am hypnotized; I wander away from my family to sit in one of the big spaces, the antechambers, looking at weird shadows and giant forms of architecture, listening to bleeps and clicks and synths and not needing to know what it all means, but realizing right then and there, on the spot, that this would be one of these stuck moments; the entire album would be tied irrevocably to the clean, clinical feeling of an art museum, perhaps the entire discography.
