A great way to start the New Year is being recognised by OpenUK's 2023 Honours List for my contributions, potential, and influence in Open Technology in the UK.

A huge congratulations to all the other honourees - many I have enjoyed working with and the rest I look forward to crossing paths and collaborating in the future.
