I was a Blackberry holdout for years and have finally caved in to purchase the Nexus 5x. Being a freshly ex-Blackberry user, I have had to answer certain questions repeatedly in the past couple of weeks, so for anyone wondering, here are my answers:

<!--halt-->

1. Did you finally realize Blackberries should die?

No. I loved my Z10 and am already missing a couple features like the Hub and gesture navigation. I have had my phone ever since the developer Z10 was released in 2013 and by now it was in rough shape. Besides a broken lock button and headphone jack and scratched screen and poor battery life, I just wanted a change.

Now that BlackBerry has mostly shifted to corporate users, getting another one wouldn't really make sense. I enjoyed their attempt at catching on with the average consumer with the release of BB10, but the momentum never really caught on and by this point is gone for developers.

2. Couldn't you have just blogged on BB?

There weren't any apps available for me on my BlackBerry to hook up to the Jekyll blogs made available through GitHub Pages. I know I could still go to GitHub on my phone and switch to desktop mode to edit a post, but for creating new ones and getting a good interface it was a pretty poor solution.


Also, and this was frustrating, GitHub doesn't render their mobile site for BlackBerry! I asked them once why on Twitter but never got an answer. They just didn't include the BB10 browser in the list of browsers to render their slick mobile version on and I'm not sure why.

## Why Use an App?
If GitHub itself isn't the best site for modifying and creating blog content, surely there must be a site for it, rather than having to find an app. Well, sort of, I have used [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor) before to write markdown online and while I'd definitely use it for desktop, it doesn't render well on mobile, which is fair, it isn't meant to be a responsive service. I give credit to [Prose](http://prose.io) which behaves well on mobile, but the screen real-estate is really small with all of the controls and it's not as fluid as a native app would be.

## What App?

The app selection on Android is as expected, much more comprehensive than BlackBerry and even with such a specific goal, I was able to find a great Markdown editor that ties right into GitHub. The one I ended up settling with is called [MrHyde](https://github.com/FauDroids/MrHyde) and so far I am really enjoying it.

MrHyde lets you create new posts and drafts after authenticating with GitHub and gives you a really clean interface for creating, modifying and publishing new files. It's exactly what I needed and it has made my mobile posting much simpler. There are currently a few bugs on Android M, for example my attempt at previewing posts failed and some of the dialogs currently have missing confirmation buttons. But given what I'm trying to do, an app like MrHyde is a breath of fresh air after coming from the BlackBerry World.

Now once I catch my own I'll see if it really holds up as a viable tool for writing regular posts going forward.

## Update

I messaged the developers and they fixed the missing dialog buttons that same day. Really pleased with the app so far.
