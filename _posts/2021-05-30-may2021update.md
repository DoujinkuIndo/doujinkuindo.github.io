Hello!

### Reducing Waste Watcher Power Consumption (Again)
I feel like this is an ongoing task that will never stop. There always seems to be some type of power consumption improve to make. This usually includes modifying the circuit, modifying the code, or both.

Ok, I'll shut up now with the intro. So what was the problem? As I always noticed, the flash was sometimes on for way too long. This is a problem because turning on the flash on the ESP32-CAM has is the most power hungry operation. For some reason I always thought the code flow was perfect, but then I realized I came up with the code so it must suck.
