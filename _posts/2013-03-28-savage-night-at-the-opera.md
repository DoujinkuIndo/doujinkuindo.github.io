# Savage Night at the Opera — Destroyer

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuDbWD_PIk I used to play a game in the library, taking out CDs and ripping them to my laptop in middle school. I had gaps in my musical knowledge: I hadn't heard of most or any of the bands. So I'd take random CDs off the shelf and look at their album art, the band name, the name of the song, and I'd guess: _folk_ or _metal?_ Destroyer is a good example of the bands that would trip me up: they're called _Destroyer_, one point for metal. The album cover for _[Kaputt_](http://poprenegade.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/destroyer.jpg)_ _is minimalist, black and white, featuring a landscape, two points for folk. The songs on _Kaputt_ are titled accordingly: Chinatown... maybe a movie reference? Gangsters and violence, possibly a point for metal? Blue Eyes, a point for folk. Savage Night at the Opera... savage is metal, but opera is folk. Nobody gets a point. Suicide Demo... two points for metal. [Poor In Love](http://www.jbuckland.com/blog/poor-in-love-destroyer/), two points for folk. Kaputt, Downtown, Song for America, too close to call. Bay of Pigs... metal, probably. Impossible to call. Turns out to be neither. I played this game with [Thrice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jRPmzQzoYs) (I was _sure_ it'd be metal, it's really alt-rock); I played it with [Lightning Bolt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQRt5E-JJfg) — Hypermagic Mountain (I was sure it'd be folk, it's really noise-rock); I played it with [My Morning Jacket](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdoOGUsEKg) (I was sure it'd be metal; it's really indie rock). The lesson here is that thirteen-year-old James _sucked_ at guessing genres.
