We see many big names in all industries that seem to just give away information, real knowledge like it’s going out of fashion.

I see the example of people like:

- [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/),
- [David Armano](http://darmano.typepad.com/),
- [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/),
- [Doc Searls](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/),
- [Mark Pesce](http://blog.futurestreetconsulting.com/),
- [Wayne Schulz](http://www.s-consult.com/),
- [Heather Smith](http://www.aniseconsulting.com/articles.html),
- [Robin Dickinson](http://robindickinson.com/) and
- [Darren Rowse](http://www.problogger.net/) all of whom give away knowledge.

This is not an exhaustive list by any means, but it is a list of a few A-Listers, a few well known in the local geographic area and a few that are well known in their field.

How can they give so much away and still make money? Should you do the same?

Let me state right upfront that I believe we should share our knowledge freely.

I’ll tell you why I believe that by relating a story told to me about four years. A mentor related this story to me. Listen to it and see what you think.
> If I told you that by riding a skateboard to work you could solve the entire worlds pollution problems, would you do it?
> No, you wouldn’t. Why not?
> Because you don’t **own** a skateboard.
> Ok, so let me give you a skateboard. Will you ride a skateboard to work now?
> No, you won’t. Why not? Because you don’t know **how** to ride a skateboard.
> Ok, so let me give you a skateboard, let me give you lessons on how to ride the skateboard. Now, will you ride the skateboard to work now?
> No, you still won’t. Why not?
> Because it’s too far, it might rain, part of the journey is uphill and **it just takes too much effort**.

The lesson here is that you can give someone the solution to a problem, the tools required and the education on how to use the tools and they still won’t go out and solve the problem for themselves.

This is a normal thing that happens everyday. I pay others to grow my food, process it and transport it to a place convienient for me to pick it up. I pay others to fix my car, wire up new lights in the house or make a fancy meal. We all do it. It’s too much effort for me to do all those things, it’s easier for me to pay someone to do them for me.

What people want is to deal with someone that does know their stuff, someone that does have that intimate knowledge of the subject, someone who is an expert. More often than not, others, like me, are prepared to pay for others to do those things I’m not expert at. Often the only way they or I find out if you know your stuff or not, is by trial and error, at our cost.

But if we were to give away knowledge, it makes it easy for people to know what it is we know, what our expertise is. They may not understand all the subtleties of what they read, or maybe they do, but either way, by telling them what we know builds their trust in us. With that trust comes their patronage.

I can hear some that say “but what if they take that knowledge and apply it themselves?”. Well, there are two answers to that:

1. Firstly, if they are not an expert in your field, they will take the knowledge you gave them and try it for themselves, make mistakes, spend more time doing the job that you would, they’ll either wear those extra costs or come back and engage your sevices.
2. Secondly, if you can’t find a market amongst seven billion people, in a market in which other experts operate, then your marketing needs an overhaul. Perhaps you should give away some of your knowledge and give them a reason to  invest their cash with you.

So how does one give away knowledge? Here are few ways:

1. [Start a blog](https://wordpress.com/) and publish articles
2. [Get a twitter account](https://twitter.com/) and start tweeting
3. [Podcast or vidcast](http://gideonshalwick.com/) about your niche
4. Comment on forums/blogs on issues in your industry
5. Post updates on your [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) wall
6. Post updates on your
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/) Profile

For a contrary view, read this article on Six Pixels of Separation titled [Free Content is Killing Media](http://www.twistimage.com/blog/archives/free-content-is-killing-media-and-advertising/) - I'd say that perhaps he has a point with regard to the media, but free content can definitely build your business.

So, what do you think? Are you going to give away some knowledge?
