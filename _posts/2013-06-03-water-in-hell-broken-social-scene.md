# Water in Hell — Broken Social Scene

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FgNCoC-rco Like a weird, happy Modest Mouse, there's lore behind[ Broken Social Scene](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/952-you-forgot-it-in-people/). There's not much to say that the above review hasn't already said a thousand times, praised and praised again. But I'll echo it: they have a power and a drive and an ongoingness that is praise-worthy, unique, fantastical. This is music untainted, without appearance or desire or subversive motive; music to exist for its own joy and pleasure of playing and listening. So you get lyrics that are poetry, instruments that are played by amateurs who just really care a whole lot; a fan-base that doesn't know or care if they're right or wrong, popular or unpopular. And it comes out, shines through, wonderfully.
