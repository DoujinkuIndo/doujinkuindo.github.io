title: Hackathon - Macmillan Cancer Support
---
In October 2015, myself and three friends took part in Liberty ITâ€™s 24 hour hackathon. Our aim was to spread awareness for Macmillan through social media. We developed a web app that provides personalised statistics on cancer risk and could easily be shared on social media. We placed second overall. Try out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/LibertyITHackathon/" target="_blank">demo</a>.

We created the web app using Bootstrap and Javascript. We had very little experience with web development at the time but over the course of the hackathon my team gained enough knowledge to enable us to create an aesthetic working product. 

A big thanks goes out to everyone on my team for their hard work and determination in this project and a massive thanks goes to Liberty IT for hosting such a brilliant event.
