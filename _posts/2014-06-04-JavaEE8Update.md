title: Java EE 8 update
excerpt: Planning for Java EE 8 is now well underway...

Planning for Java EE 8 is now well underway. As you know, a few weeks ago, we conducted a three part Java EE 8 Community Survey. The data gathered have been very influential for the next steps. You can now expect over the coming weeks and months to see updates on the various specifications that compose the Java EE platform.


Some Specification Leads are busy gathering additional feedback regarding what they should focus their efforts on (e.g. [CDI 2 survey](http://www.cdi-spec.org/news/2014/05/28/CDI-2_0-survey/)). Other Specification Leads have already publicly exposed what they think should be one of the focus for the evolution of the specification they lead.  For example, adding Server-Sent Events (SSE) support and MVC support in JAX-RS is being discussed here. Please remember that the fact we are now discussing any feature does not ensure that it will be included in the proposal, nor in any particular update to Java EE. We can expect additional enhancements, changes and evolution as we get closer to the finalization of the different specifications... and there is still a long way to go with these specification proposals!

Linda DeMichiel, Java EE Co-Specification Lead, has recently posted a draft proposal for the Java EE 8 Platform specification. Linda's goal is to recruit people and companies supporting this proposal before submitting it to the JCP.
This draft proposal is an interesting reading as it contains relevant information on the plans for Java EE 8 such as :

Some themes:

* Support for the latest web standards (eg. HTTP 2.0) 

* Continue to work on ease of development

* Improve the infrastructure for cloud support

* Alignment with Java SE 8

New JSRs to be added to the platform:

* J-Cache

* Java API for JSON Binding

* Java Configuration

And some ideas on technologies to prune in Java EE 8, etc. So if you haven't done it yet, I really encourage you to read the Java EE 8 draft proposal!

Our goal for the Java EE 8 specification is for it to be finalized in the second half of 2016. It is important to note that we are in the early days of Java EE 8 and at this stage everything (themes, content, timing, etc.) is preliminary. Everything still needs to be discussed, challenged and agreed within the different Java Community Process (JCP) Experts Groups (EGs). Some EGs that still need to be formed! It could also means that the road-map will have to be adjusted to follow the progress being made in the different EGs.

Cameron Purdy, Vice President of Development at Oracle responsible for the Java EE platform, recently shared the Java EE 8 road-map at Java Day Tokyo 2014 (see [here](http://otndnld.oracle.co.jp/ondemand/javaday2014/movie/mp4/140522_K1.mp4)).

This is also a good occasion to remind you that [participation](https://jcp.org/ja/participation/overview) within those upcoming JCP Experts Groups is encouraged. Contributing in an EG is an effective lever to influence what Java EE 8 will become! Finally, as things get more concrete, we will share details on how to engage in the different Java EE 8 related Adopt-a-JSR initiatives, another way to contribute.
