My keynote, "2.66 Million", from KubeCon CloudNativeCon EU in Barcelona. This was the largest audience that I've spoken to to date, with 7700 people plus livestreaming.

I had a great time speaking about the contributor pipeline, women in open source, and mental health in tech.

Many people told me afterwards that they felt inspired to participate and contribute to Kubernetes and the other CNCF projects.

The slides are available here:

I also presented the End User Awards to Intuit later that day.
