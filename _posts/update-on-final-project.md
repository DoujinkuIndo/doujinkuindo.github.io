Around the world, we have like more than 200 film industries, and in India alone we have close to 25 industries, where 95% of this industry around the world have male priority, male takes up to almost 75-80% of roles, where most industries around the world women are just used for sex material, partially naked, stuff like that. So, for my Final project, I had chosen to do a male/female ratio. In India, close to 1000 films are made yearly, in which hardly there are 4 to 5 women oriented films, and from there hardly one might work at box-office. In male oriented films in India, female have roles 10-12% in films, where 80% will go on songs, partially nudity, revealing clothes, only 20% will go to speaking role. So, in my project I have chosen an Indian film called "Theri”, where I found out 80% of characters in the film are males, and 90% of films dialogues were spoken by male characters. Compare to any other film industries around the world, female’s roles in films are lowest in Indian films. Other than having small roles in the film, Indian woman always have played weak characters, like raise their own voice, or have they’re on statement or opinion, which we hardly see in any other film industry around the world.

Per data I have got after watching movie "Theri”, the hero of the film Vijay, had almost talk with each character in the film, his screen presence in screen was almost for 1 hour and 57 minutes from a 2 hour and 19-minute movie. His dialogues made up to 75% of total film dialogues. Whereas there were 2 females in the movie, both combined had less than 25 minutes of screen presence, and had just 5% of film dialogues. which clearly shows males priority in Indian films. So, my main concern of this project was to show how baldly women are treated in Indian films, how less they are paid compare to an male actors, how less roles they are being given compare to an male actors.
