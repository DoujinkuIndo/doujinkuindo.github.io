## Terminology
<dl>
  <dt>HTTP Request Method</dt>
  <dd>The desired action to be performed for a given resource. These are defined in the HTTP specification. The most common methods we will cover are <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code></dd>
  <dt>HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</dt>
  <dd>A URI is a string that refers to a resource. We know these best as URLs. <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/difference-between-uri-url/">All URLs are URIs</a>, but not all URIs are URLs.</dd>
  <dt>Route</dt>
  <dd>An HTTP method combined with a URL. For example: <code>GET https://example.com/api/animals</code></dd>
</dl>

## 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
See [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) in the MDN glossary

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the softwareâ€™s business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).

The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:

- Model: Manages data and business logic.
- View: Handles layout and display.
- Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.
