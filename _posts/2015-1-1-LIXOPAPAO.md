##### Lixo Papão | Apple Developer Academy


Lixo Papão
====
Lixo Papão is a project that we developed in Apple Developer Academy (BEPiD) in partneship with existing project in the university called "Lixo Papão". 

The first and original project was developed by Design Students from KEA (Denmark) and Senac (Brazil) in the [The São Paulo Project](http://www.thesaopauloproject.com/). 

Our project was focused in the technology and when we met Lixo Papão, we combine two ideias to build a new. Thanks to Poly (design in the first project), that is joined in our team, we combined two projects.
