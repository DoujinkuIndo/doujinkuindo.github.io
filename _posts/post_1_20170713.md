##Dumb idea #1 :  Unix socket directories /tmp missing from .sock

Sometimes you come across an overachiever. Someone that thinks very highly of himself but keeps on inventing new ways to shakle you.
 
Today idea #1 : let’s cut down the number of entries in the unix_socket_directories entry of postgresql.conf

Alright now, PostgreSQL might not be the smartest ever when it comes to managing .sock files for local connections.

**BUT...**

If you remove the /tmp option in postgresql.conf unix_socket_directories, you will end up with this nice message from PostgreSQL :


~~~
[postgres@noeyypjx ~]$ psql
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
~~~


Well now you have to provide psql with either 

 `psql -h localhost` 

or 
`psql -h /var/run/postgresql`

depending on what you find in your unix_socket_directories.

So just keep the /tmp in your entry.

**WHY ?**

It’s the best way to keep the file /tmp is emptied on each reboot so it’s always squeaky clean.

And above all : PostgreSQL always tries to connect only using this folder by default.

Removing entries will not help security. Other things can. 


unix_socket_directories = '/var/run/postgresql, /var/postgres/test/9.6/run, /tmp
