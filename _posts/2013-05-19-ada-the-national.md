# Ada — The National

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aV0Ka-SSEU A song about cutting it too close — the phase 'on the edge' can't capture the dread, only the excitement. Juggling things, trying to keep seven, eight balls in the air, knowing one'll drop. Use paper and markers and computers and set out your life — become fast and diligent and efficient, know and trust the people in your life, stave off loneliness. Things catch up to you if you don't do them right the first time. Hold yourself together, hold yourself together, hold yourself together, or things will all fall apart.
