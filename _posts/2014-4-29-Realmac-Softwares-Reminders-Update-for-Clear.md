title: Realmac Software's Reminders Update for Clear
---

This morning [Realmac Software](#)(realmacsoftware.com) finally released the long awaited "Reminders Update" for it's popular list app [Clear](#)(realmacsoftware.com/clear).  The popular iOS and Mac list app was promised its update to be released by the end of February, but it was quickly pushed back to the end of March.  It was pushed back a second time to the end of April.  This was bad news for the company after it had already frustrated many customers with its initial lack of iOS 7 support and the release of Clear+, and then backtracking and getting rid of Clear+ all together.  Realmac Software was smart though with their reminders update.  For everyone who had purchased Clear+, they provided two new "sound packs" for free, where others would have to obtain them through in-app purchases.  I found this to be a great way for them to say, "sorry about all the confusion, have this on us."  The delay of the reminds function was more disappointing than anything else, but if the delay was due to making the two new sound packs, then I'd say it was worth it for getting them for free.

So let's take a look at the new features.

The first thing I did after updating was to get my free sound packs.  To do this, I had to re-download Clear+ from my list of purchased apps in the App Store and open it.  Once it was opened, I could go back into Clear and go to the sound packs.  I was asked if I wanted to access my free sound packs and prompted for my Apple ID password.

Next I created a new item in one of my lists and tapped "Add Reminder."  Doing this prompted me with a day and time selector.

I noticed two small dots at the bottom of the selector so I tried swiping left to right and sure enough it opened up a one month calendar view that allowed me to scroll up and down through the months of the year.

Nik Fletcher, Realmac Software's Product Manager, said the delays were due to making sure that they had the new features right.  I've updated Clear on both my iPhone 5s and iPad Air.  Clear runs flawlessly on both of them and the wait was well worth it.  As someone who first purchased Clear on my iPhone the day it was released, I've ridden this roller-coaster of a ride for both its ups and downs.  However, the ups always seem to outweigh the downs.  For those of you out there who don't believe Realmac Software should have created Clear+ in the first place or perhaps you just don't like being charged for updates, skip your morning Starbucks for a day and grab the update (more on this topic coming soon).

I'd like to end this with one slight suggestion for Realmac Software: feel free to tease us with updates all you want, it generates user interest, just don't give a release date.  I would much rather wait two months for a great feature and not know when I'm going to get it, than to be told when and be left disappointed for two months.  But as for this update, great work!
