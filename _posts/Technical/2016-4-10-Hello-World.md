Welcome to my blog! Hooray, my personal blog is up and running now. I have long wanted to have my own blog for sharing my projects. Luckily, we are living in the best era ever. Millions of open source are free and available for us to learn almost whenever wherever we want. We have alternatives other than paying ever increasing tuition fee at school to obtain quality education. I praise the TECHNOLOGY for making this possible. After reading "Blog Like a Hacker " by Tom Preston-Werner, I am totally inspired and told myself, "I gotto do it this time!". 

Jekyll is integrated with GitHub to host web site on GitHub based on their repositories. It generates static page by taking content, rendering Markdown and Liquid template. The biggest advantage of using Jekyll for building static blog site in GitHub is it's simplified build process in GitHub. Jekyll manages build process in GitHub with a single push file changes to pages publishing branch. I am all ready to write my first blog using Jekyll!!
