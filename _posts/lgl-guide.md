Last summer, I had a 500,000 node network, with a million connections, and no way to look at its structure. Cytoscape maxes out at about 100,000 connections, and for some reason that I can't remember now,  I never got my network to load on the million node capable OpenOrd Layout for Gephi.      

As there aren't many resources on using the Large Graph Layout, I wanted to do a quick post on my tips for using the software.

Aaron Swartz used LGL for a visualization of blogspace in 2006 http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/blogviz
