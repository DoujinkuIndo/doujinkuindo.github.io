While this is not a design program, that doesn't mean we have to develop ugly web applications. In the next four days, we will cover fundamental design principles that will (hopefully) make your applications stand out in a crowd.

## Objectives for the day
- Get to know each other (more)!
- Define design.
  - Explore the different fields of design.
  - Briefly summarize the history of print design.
    - Explain ways to make content easier to read.
  - Discuss the underlying principles of visual hierarchy.
    - Find examples of websites that could be improved using these principles.

### Breakout Activity 1
In groups of 3 or 4, quickly introduce yourselves and review each of your entry tickets.
- What interest/fact/circumstance makes you unique(ish)?
- Given the choice would you rather be a frontend or backend developer?
- Can any of your fellow group members help you accomplish the goals listed in your entry ticket?

## 2. What is Design?
Tony's very general definition of art:
<dl>
  <dt>Art</dt> 
  <dd>A process of creation that converts information (e.g. clay) into meaning (e.g. sculpture). Great art creates hidden meaning.</dd>
</dl>

Tony's very general definition of design:
<dl>
  <dt>Design</dt> 
  <dd>A process that **solves a problem** by extracting meaning (e.g. page heading) from information (e.g. text). Great design is intuitive.</dd>
</dl>

**Lunchtime Reflection**: We'll be covering user experience design tomorrow. What other fields/industries of design do you know of?

## 3. Visual Hierarchy
In the context of print and graphic design, visual hierarchy is one of many tools that help the viewer find meaning from a "page" (e.g. resume, web page, business card, etc).

### Breakout Activity 2
In groups of 3 or 4, explore the concept of visual hierarchy in the print design industry.
- You found an example of print design. How does it use (or not use) visual hierarchy? What changes would you make?
- What other media of print/graphic design are there? Do the same visual hierarchy principles apply equally from one medium to another?
- Which of your favourite websites makes the best use of visual hierarchy?

Summarize your findings and elect a representative to share them with the rest of the class.

## Clean Up Time!

2. Find an example of product design (a handy tool, piece of equipment, etc) in your immediate(ish) area (home, office, vehicle, etc). You will be discussing your find in a group of 3 or 4 tomorrow.
3. Skim: [UI Design Patterns](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns)
4. Skim: Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of _Don't Make Me Think_ by Steve Krug (course textbook)
