While this is not a design program, that doesn't mean we have to develop ugly web applications. In the next four days, we will cover fundamental design principles that will (hopefully) make your applications stand out in a crowd.

## Objectives for the day
- Get to know each other (more)!
- Define design.
- Explore the different fields of design.
- Briefly summarize the history of print design.
- Discuss the underlying principles of Visual Hierarchy.
- Find examples of websites that could be improved using these principles.
