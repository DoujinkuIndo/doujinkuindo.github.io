title: Starting at CodeClan
---

Hi there!

I've started! I've left my old job and started a Developers course at CodeClan. I've just finished my second day, I decided to start a blog here to try and help consolidate everything that I learn and help keep my thoughts in order.

Today was the second day of the course. We started by going through our homework from yesterday. The biggest issue for people was navigation of directories via command line(Terminal! sorry). Luckily I'm familiar with Linux so for me it as just a nice refresher.

The rest of the day was spent on methods. Particularly creating and testing them. You can see the work I did on this <a href="https://github.com/mattbryce93/method-exercises">here!</a>

To get this blog running as desired I'm going to work on this site this evening. I want to get it set up with my own personal domain. It should be interesting as I also need to figure out how to ensure that the SSL certificates will be configured. Otherwise anyone seeing this site will also receive rather unpleasant errors (if this isn't https://brycedev.co.uk then you know I've not figured it out yet).

Wish me luck!
