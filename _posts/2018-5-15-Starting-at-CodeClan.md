title: Starting at CodeClan
---

Hi there!

I've started! I've left my old job and started a Developers course at CodeClan. I've just finished my second day, I decided to start a blog to consolidate everything I learn and help keep my thoughts in order.

Today we started by discussing our homework from yesterday. One issue was navigation of directories via command line (Terminal! sorry). Luckily, I'm familiar with Linux so for me it was nice to just nail down the fundamentals.

The rest of the day was spent on methods, in particular creating and testing. You can see the work I did today <a href="https://github.com/mattbryce93/method-exercises">here!</a>

I will reflect on each day at CodeClan and try to post what we worked through along with the relevant repositroy. I wish to set up this blog with my personal domain. This should be interesting as I also need to establish how SSL certificates will be configured. Otherwise anyone viewing this site will receive rather unpleasant security errors (if this isn't https://brycedev.co.uk then you know I've not figured it out yet).

Wish me luck!
