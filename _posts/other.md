In the [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}/Fisher-Pearson/) I gave a historical overview of Karl Pearson and Ronald Fishers' work in eugenics.
In retrospect, their opinions are no less disturbing than the fact that despite their racism, they were still held in the highest esteem by the mathematics and statistics community.
How do we make sense of this history in a decolonized statistics and what have we normalized from that period of history that bears re-assessing? 
These are the questions that I hope to touch on in this post.

First of all, the implications that Fisher and Pearson, the leading statisticians of the age, explicitly endorsed settler colonialism and population eugenics draws statistics as a discipline into a moral grey-zone. 
It is of course possible to imagine that Fisher and Pearson were anomalies in the discipline, but given the fact that they were still hailed by their contemporaries as leading thinkers, this seems unlikely.
Far more likely is that the discipline at that time was inextricably linked to eugenics so the ideas discussed by Pearson and Fisher weren't far outside the norm.
The proximity of classic statistical techniques to some of the worst crimes against humanity ever perpetuated (colonization, Jim Crow in the American south, Apartheid in South Africa, the Holocaust), is very uncomfortable and bears reflecting on.
Is it so that classic statistical techniques were merely used and abused in justifying eugenics and white supremacy, or does the connection run deeper?
Is our understanding of the groundwork of statistics fundamentally changed by Fisher and Pearsons' research in eugenics?

One basic example of a dangerous statistical inheritance from these men is the continued confusion between correlation and causation, especially as it involves race.
Just as Fisher was biased in concluding that because intergenerational fertility rates are [highly correlated](https://archive.org/stream/geneticaltheoryo00fishuoft#page/208/mode/2up/search/correlated), the number of children a woman has is genetically determined, so are many modern day confusions of correlation and causation.
I have mentioned the [inherent racism](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) of "recidivism risk" scoring models before (models which are meant to predict whether an offender will commit a crime again) and that essentially their use represents a continuation of biased confusion in misinterpreting correlations.
These models were formulated by implicitly biased statisticians and criminologists (I wonder what the progenitors of this science looked like) at [Northpointe Inc](http://www.northpointeinc.com/) who formulated the COMPAS score as a measure of likelihood to re-offend which they proved is moderately correlated to recidivism.
These models use variables such as joblessness and poverty (which are highly correlated with being black or brown due to systemic racism and oppression), as highly weighted predictors.
Furthermore, they rely on subjective decisions made by the interviewer about whether the offender (looks like a gang member)[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2702103-Sample-Risk-Assessment-COMPAS-CORE.html]  and contains privilege-exposing questions such as whether the offender thinks that hungry people have the right to steal.
These variables are heavily affected by race and the opportunities that come with it, so the resulting COMPAS score has been shown to over-predict recidivism in black and brown offenders, while vastly under-predicting in white offenders.

There is no reason to believe that this subjective COMPAS score *causes* re-offending, but judges across the US use its moderate correlation as justification for their consistently racist judgements against black and brown offenders.
My interpretation of the situation is that judges go into a case with an implicit (or explicit) bias against people of color due to their socialization in our post-colonial world.
They implicitly believe that people of color are criminals, so that when the COMPAS algorithm gives a (racistly) high score for an offender of color, they take this as justification to give a harsher sentence.
However, if the same offender was white but still received a high COMPAS score (which happens rarely), the judge implicitly could assume that since COMPAS score is only *correlated* with recidivism, it might still be worth giving this offender (who looks like the judge) a more lenient sentence.
This is a direct descendent of the racist blurring of correlation and causation which began with eugenics and is still perpetuated in statistics today.


Thinking back to my undergraduate statistics courses, one of the most fundamentally important concepts is the idea of "significant difference". 
Two samples taken at random from a population will never be exactly the same, but we learned that the goal of statistics is to determine if that difference is significant.
Similarly in a regression procedure, we only view a predictor variable as important if it can be proved to be significantly different from zero.




Statistics implicitly/explicitly endorsed colonialism on a disciplinary scale
Categorization, division
Binary, significant or not
Even in modern times, people misunderstand correlation and causation politics
Recidivism models predict based on high correlation between blackness and poverty
Say more about recidivism models later

Fisher and Pearson were influential scientists on a philosophical scale as well
Design of experiments
Bias/random etc

Also techniques developed by fisher and pearson cannot be neutral after how they were created
Know history of paired t test comparing nose sizes
Divisive, superiority

In class? How relevant
Uncomfortable for non+white

Lanugage used
Discriminant analysis, significant difference, this is divisive
