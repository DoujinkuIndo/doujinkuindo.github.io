  영어 공부를 위해서 무엇을 할까를 생각하다가, 역시 생겨먹은 게 정치학도인 이상 정치학 책을 사서 읽으면 되겠지라고 작년 쯤부터 생각했었다. 사놓고 썩히다가, 어제서야 다 읽었다. 욕심내지 않고 하루에 30 페이지씩 읽으니까 딱 4일 걸렸다. 얇게 손에 잡히게 나온 판형이 맘에 든다.

<div>
  It&#8217;s the matter of how British politics operates and how the constituency has been remained since the 17th century and if we want to examine the British politics, we have to see the Britishness.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I can get a lot of answers from this book.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Firstly, for example the matter of &#8216;written constitution&#8217;.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;This is why it has always been misleading to describe Britain as having an unwritten constitution, or no proper constitution at all. Rather it has a constitution that is not codified or enacted into a single book of rules.&#8221;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I have to admit I haven&#8217;t known about British constitution.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Second, the question between the &#8216;executive power&#8217; and &#8216;legislative power&#8217;. In Britian, the majority party which was voted above half of MPs rules the &#8216;House'(of lords and commons). The leader of majority party(now The Labour) is the Prime Ministor. In Korea, separation between executive power, legislative power and judical power in the constitution. It&#8217;s the main difference. As Montesque said the separation of power means &#8216;democratic&#8217; symmetry, I always think that&#8217;s true. However, we can recognise it&#8217;s not matter of separation of power but of &#8216;accountability&#8217; when we read this book.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  The Prime Minister in British has a lot of power but he is responsible to anything occuring in Britain. Surely, it&#8217;s not about atonement but a election.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  In these days, there has been a change from EU. They demand referendum for their political unification and it&#8217;s so unusual for British people. British people have been voting for their MP and the action makes everything &#8216;political&#8217;. Then the Britishness doesn&#8217;t make sense today?
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Tony Wright doesn&#8217;t agree. The EU politics can influence Britishness in someway but intrinsic parts won&#8217;t be changed or revolved by it. It&#8217;s matter of British people. No external matter.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  There a lot of problems that have been accumulated since Magna Carta. For example the matter of &#8216;devolution&#8217; and &#8216;centric politics and local grassroot politics&#8217;. I want to read more about them.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It&#8217;s very curious about studying British politics. I don&#8217;t like it because of simplicity of British politics but of the &#8216;accountability&#8217; and &#8216;ideological division and its modernisation&#8217;.
</div>

<div>
  My english is so poor and I can&#8217;t express everything I want to refer.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I just hope it&#8217;ll be better and I&#8217;m exercising.
