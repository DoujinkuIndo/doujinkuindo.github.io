### How CNCF changed the way I think

1. *The closest thing in public service to tech* - how working at a non-profit gave me a different perspective on doing the right thing
1. *After CNCF you could be* - set others up for future success
1. *Failure is an option* - get comfortable with trying many things and failing
1. *Treat your career like your portfolio* - diversify with new people and opportunities
1. *Please do your leave here!* - why enthusiastic support is important for diversity
