One of the things that has irked me about Vista has been how hard (read how many clicks it takes) to get to the Network Connections in Vista. Thus here is how to create a shortcut to take you straight there.

Right click on your desktop |
**New**
|
**Shortcut**
|

**explorer.exe ::{7007ACC7-3202-11D1-AAD2-00805FC1270E}**

 |
**Next**
| enter an appropriate name like
**Network Connections**
 |
**Finish**
and bingo, you now have a shortcut to take you straight there.
