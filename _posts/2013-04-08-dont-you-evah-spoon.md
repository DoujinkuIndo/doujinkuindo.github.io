# Don't You Evah — Spoon

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqWSGenyE0 I don't know much about Spoon — they're modern, probably, but have a simple, timeless sound that could be 90s, 80s even. They're muddled and obscure lyrics, clear drums and guitars, harmonies and timbre over content. I don't know what motivates the singer, other than the desire to create something appealing. In that sense, this music becomes very hedonistic — and it's about these sorts of things, too. It only wants to dance, but it's not dance music so much as energy music. There's an underlying sense of things happening, constantly, of being a theme of progress and discovery and recanting of stories, of the past, the future, etc — and yet, here I was, thinking that the song was indicative of Spoon, only to find out it's a [cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj7Gt8QVv38). So now I don't know what to think.
