So you're working on a Microsoft Server machine, merrily getting stuff done, when you get a message saying that it can't continue because files are open. Sound familiar? It happens to me often.

Here is how I find out which files are open and who has them open:

If you're working on a Microsoft Server 2008,

**Start**
|
**Administrative Tools**
 |
**Share and Storage Management**
 |
**Manage Open Files...**


If you're working on a Microsoft Server 2003,

**Start**
|
right click
**My Computer**
 |
**Manage**
|
**Computer management (local)**
 |
**System Tools**
 |
**Shared Folders**
 |
**Open Files**


Makes it a great deal easier, now you know which file needs closing, and who you need ask to do it.

Hope that helps you. Anything you've found helpful? Let me know in the comments.
