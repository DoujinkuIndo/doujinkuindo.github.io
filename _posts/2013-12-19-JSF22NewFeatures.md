A lot of airtime is spent on the APIs that were added to Java EE 7 (e.g. WebSocket) and APIs that went through a major revision (e.g. JMS 2.0 or JAX-RS 2.0). But let's not forget that a lot of others APIs have been revised in Java EE 7 and this sometime implies new features, new capabilities.

In his JavaOne 2013 session, Roger Kitain and Edward Burns who are both Specification Leads for JavaServer Faces, explains in details some of the important features that were added to JSF 2.2 (e.g. Faces Flow, HTML5-friendly markup, Resource library contracts). Those new features are explained in detail and demonstrated in the context of a self-contained sample application. Ed and Roger also shows that JSF is still relevant in today's enterprise software stack, they finally compares the benefits of upgrading to JSF 2.2 against opting for a totally new architecture.
