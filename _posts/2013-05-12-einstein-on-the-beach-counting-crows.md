# Einstein On The Beach — Counting Crows

> One more sun comes sliding down the sky One more shadow leans against a wall

This is a song out of nowhere — not off a best-selling album by a best-selling band, but a rarities mix — it made it to the charts, to the _Billboard_ Modern Rock Tracks number-one single position. It's not related to the opera of the same name. It's not overtly about anything, it's not eminently decipherable. The song was an outtake from _August and Everything After_. It never should have made it big. I knew, at first listen, it was golden. I think it's about Albert Einstein (of course) and his uncertainty for his contributions to the a-bomb, for his own personal triumphs and failures. I think it's a careful meditation on the psyche of a man the band hardly knew — so, a fictionalized version, but one that is just as meaningful. The lyrics are clear — he has that capacity to do great or terrible things, and it's ripping him apart — he'll get help, but he'll never be together again.
