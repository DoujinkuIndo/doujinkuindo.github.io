# Counting Crows — St. Robinson In His Cadillac Dream

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6SEVMhwShQ Whenever I talk about music with anyone over the age of about thirty, the idea of tonal shift always comes up: most music today has a great divide between the tone of its music and the tone of its lyrics. Modern music can be poppy and upbeat, and discuss sadness and loss. Often it's slow and sad but has hopeful and uplifting lyrics. The theory is that this is a new development, and I'm inclined to agree — it's hard to picture [Ella Fitzgerald](http://www.last.fm/music/Ella+Fitzgerald/_/Please+Don't+Talk+About+Me+When+I'm+Gone) pulling this trick, (although not as hard to picture Sinatra); but Opera, Soul, Blues, R+B, modern Musicals, Rock 'n' Roll, not even Rap ever has real cognitive dissonance Yet modern Rock, and especially Alternative (call it Indie, whatever) does this a lot. _St. Robinson in His Cadillac Dream_ is the button song on the Counting Crows' 1999 album _[This Desert Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Desert_Life)_; a wonderful, flawed, expert rendition of Americana pop mixed with [shoegaze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ey4yAgLZlw). Yet it's a prime example: a sad, melancholy song put to poppy, heightened banjo, organ, and guitar. It leaves echoes of... uncertainty? A wonderful example is [The Cure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZoYzne9Tpg), although I'm not sure that they began the trend — Plainsong is Robert Smith going off to write a secret love letter to his wife, shrouded in the timbre of the previously dark stuff The Cure had done earlier in the 80s. It became massively popular, an [all-consuming](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/) emotional statement, as Pitchfork so puts it. It sounds sad, but it's deeply happy. _St. Robinson_ pulls the same trick. Most modern indie music pulls the same trick. But _why?_
