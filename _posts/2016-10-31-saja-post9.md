My claim is that the three texts will have enough similarities to come to a conclusion that all three texts have the same core or fundamental message meaning that all the texts are of the same religion and that the only reason for differnces between the texts is the passing of the texts through corrupt leaders (monarchs and clergy) over time.

This is a very hefty claim. 

The reasoning that supports my claim is that all three texts were sent down to Prophets that were descendants of Abraham and all three religions are considered to monotheistic.

The evidence I seek to use is through running tf-idf on all three texts and analyzing word frequencies in all of them. I may need to look at the location/part of the text that specific words come up more often. I may need to look at word associations (which words come next to other words). 

Any complications or objections I may have is that the texts I will be using are not going to be the "original" texts as I don't have access to those excpet with the Qur'an. And even then, they are not all in the same language, so I have to be chooisng the english translations of all three texts. There are different versions of both the Torah and the Bible and so I will have to decide which ones to analyze. To combat this seeming subjectivity, I plan on choosing the three most widely-used or popular versions of each English langauge/translation of each text. I will somehow combine/compare the results I get of differences within different versions of each text before I move on to compare all three texts.

My warrant would be that because the reasonings I made are mostly accepted in the three religions and after consulting family trees, my claim does have some ground - since they're all related, shouldn't they all come with the same message reinforcing each other instead of coming down with entirely different religions?
