# Guilty Cocker Spaniels — Modest Mouse

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igXIB2ArH8c I was used to the tone and structure of a typical song at this point. Modest Mouse were verbose, redneck, literary and uncultured; clever and professional and yet so rusty and loose. But I was adjusted at this point, so I got to listen to these songs with open ears, listening for songwriting, dynamics; how they'd perform them, how I'd cover them; what they meant and what they did and if they matched; what was a choice and what was interpretation; how they wanted me to see it and how I really did. This song is _clever_; it has wordplay and nice swells and swoops of phrase; it has Isaac Brock's unusual exaggerated vocals; it's more melodic and yet somehow more _full_, more _wall-of-sound_ than most; further from trucker rock and more into indie pop, but never twee. I like it a lot, and it was one of those new songs. The ones you listen to and you _must_ share.
