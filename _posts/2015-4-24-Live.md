title: A Hello World (of sorts)
---

Wow, and I thought the [Famous 5-Minute Install](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install "WordPress, Famous 5-Minute Install") was fast! Jekyll, coupled with github pages is a great idea and took me even less than 5 minutes. I can't wait to transform this site. Annnnnnd, begin!

_config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
