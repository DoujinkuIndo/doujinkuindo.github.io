The Manjaro Community is looking for the perfect way of reflecting the unique identity of this very special Linux Distribution on the net. Recently we have been experimenting with a new [forum](https://forum.manjaro.org/), the [Wiki](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and blog have been migrated to new servers and right now we are in the process of building a new homepage.  
You're welcome to join in with your suggestions and ideas and with any technical help you may have to offer on the [forum](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/help-us-to-redesign-our-homepage/5701) or send us an [email](mailto:support@manjaro.org).
