# On'n'on — Justice

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIW1m3jbEsg I'll sometimes go to sleep thinking about  a problem, hoping it'll be solved when I wake up — sometimes it's something in CS I'm working on, sometimes it's a logistical problem, sometimes it's musical, for arranging. We have this weird power to sift through massive amounts of data when we're asleep, like a computer devoting its downtime to a rendering farm. The same thing goes: if I fall asleep after listening to a genre of music, I'll wake up with a very specific song in my head, already fully assembled and remembered, complete in tone and lyric, with absolutely no idea what song it is — I'll rush to Google and check what it was. This was one of those songs, bouncing around, waiting to be noticed.
