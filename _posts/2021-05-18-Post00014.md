title: "Algorithm & Data Structure - Boyer - Moore Majority Vote Algorithm"
---


## Problem statement
 
 Given a series of data representing the candidates that is voted. Find the candidate with majority votes. Majority means more than 50%. The data could be stream data. 

An inuative appraoach is to count and record the number of candidates and once any candidate exceed 50% of total votes, that's the majority candidate. This approach could be done in linear time, but need O(k) space, where k is number of candidates. 

Another simpler approach that solves this problem is invented by Boyer and Moore and called Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm. The basic principle behand this algorithm is: if there exists a candiate has votes more than half, then this candidate's vote is more than all other candidates' votes. Mathematically, $$ y = x^2 $$

```math
    N_{majority} - \sigma { N_{others}} > 0
```
