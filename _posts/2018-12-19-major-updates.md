Over the last few week or so I've been toying with the idea of going to just a blog and removing the other pages on here.

I think I'm going to do it.

The content that would have ended up in pages will just get placed in blog posts, and I'll probably slow down on the posts as they'll get pretty long. I'll go through and add update links to them when sequential posts appear, and then maybe a page way later on that combines categories of posts.

Not sure. I have plenty of time before I need to be there.
