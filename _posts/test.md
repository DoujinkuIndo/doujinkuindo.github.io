This is a short overview of information that I've found to get you started learning the ins and outs of Machine Learning and everything around it. 
"... if you think you're kind of late to the to the party with machine learning I assure you, you're not" **- [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/about)**.

### You are ...
... an engineering graduate or a practicing engineer in the Mechanical, Civil, Chemical, or Electrical disciplines. You have some exposure to programming. You want to see where Machine Learning can be used in your field and how it can help you.

### Resources
At the time of writing this post these were the best learning resources that I've found, subjectively speaking. There was no objective evaluation of reliable critarias. If I liked the feel of it and the presentation of the material, it was good enough for me. Although the one criteria that I kept in mind is to make sure the material would not dwell too much on the programing theory, and more on the application side of things.

My language of choice is Python. If you never heard of it, learn the bare minimum of how it works, and then jump straight into the following resources.

 **[1. Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python Intro][1]**<br>by [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/about).

**[2. Your First Machine Learning Project in Python Step-By-Step][2]** <br>by [PhD. Jason Brownlee at Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com)
This resource was actually recommended by the Two Minutes Paper youtuber in the video below.

Short video overview with a great list of additional resources.
