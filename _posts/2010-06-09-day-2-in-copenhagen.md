Went for a quick ride out to Roskilde&#8230; Didn&#8217;t know if there was much there aside from a Viking Museum (pretty badass in itself, so naturally I had to check it out), and after having been there I can confirm no, no there isn&#8217;t much there aside from a Viking Museum. As such, I have only 3 photos to show you

I could have posted more photos, but it would be like &#8220;oooh, a viking wreck&#8230; oooh another viking wreck. OH MY GOD IT&#8217;S YET ANOTHER GODDAMN VIKING WRECK!!&#8221;

Oh, I also learnt that &#8216;viking&#8217; was a term for &#8216;pirates of the north&#8217;&#8230; Strictly speaking they overwhelmingly weren&#8217;t into piracy (was a bit hard back then without CD burners or Rapidshare and Megaupload), but being pirates of some sort makes them completely badass.
