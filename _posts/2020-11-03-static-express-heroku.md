## Tooltime
- environment variables
  - command not found
  - `env` terminal command

## Homework
1. Review: 
    - [Anatomy of an HTTP Transaction](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/)
    - [Node `http` sample code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/sample-code/tree/master/backend/node/http)
2. Express
    - Watch: The first 20 minutes of [How to build a REST API with Node js & Express](https://youtu.be/pKd0Rpw7O48) by Mosh Hamedani (we'll eventually cover most of this video)
    - Read: [Express/Node introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)
    - Read: [Setting up a Node development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment)
    - Read: [Serving static files in Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html)
    - Read: [Using Express Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
3. `dotenv`
