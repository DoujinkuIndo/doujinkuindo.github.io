Got into leeds about 1 pm yesterday and from what I could tell it was a pretty cool little city and now I&#8217;m wishing I gave myself a bit more time to check it out. Today is the Bank Holiday though, so everything&#8217;s closed anyway&#8230; maybe not so much fun on a public holiday with everything closed, but I think I might have to come back sometime.

Slam Dunk North (Leeds) &#8211; wayyyyyyy better than South (London). Aside from the hour+ lineup just to get into the festival, once I was in it was all pretty good. All stages were indoors and for the most part it was pretty easy to get into every room&#8230; though I missed Moneen again thanks to that line outside.

Bands I saw:  
The Wonder Years  
Crime In Stereo  
Rolo Tomassi  
Blackhole  
Set Your Goals  
RX Bandits  
Four Year Strong  
New Found Glory

    And lastly a photo of the view out of our hotel room in Leeds&#8230; Looks like a pretty grey and dull place (mostly thanks to the dodgy weather), but I really liked it here.
