# Bodysnatchers — Radiohead

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVDSdDoD4Sg Stepping outside of the lore and myth around Radiohead, this is a damn good rock song, loud and fast and sharp and in motion, delicate and precise and industrial, with anger and love and confusion at its core, twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom. I read — and I don't care if it's true, but I feel like it might be — that they recorded this one in an old abandoned house they found; lugged in the equipment, got the echo just the way they wanted. It doesn't matter if I can hear what they heard, because I can hear them play the way they wanted to play based on what they heard, if that makes sense. I don't know what the song means or what it does, but I know how it feels, and I could dance to it.
