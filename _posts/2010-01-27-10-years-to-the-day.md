since I first saw him fronting Foo Fighters, I caught Dave Grohl wielding the sticks for his new supergroup Them Crooked Vultures.

I had never even listened to Them Crooked Vultures before, but the prospect of watching Dave Grohl drum his arse off, and the addition of John Paul Jones and Josh Homme was a little hard to pass up.
