If you were to take the time to look at a number of great leaders, you would probably find similar abilities and traits. These may include the ability to inspire or to encourage, or perhaps these leaders exude honesty and creativity. While these aspects are all wonderful, there is one attribute of a great leader that people seem to be drawn towards arguably more than others: humility.

Humble is how one might describe Calvert Willie Davidson, or simply Cal to those who knew him.

Born in South Carolina, Cal was raised in Norfolk, Va.. The oldest of three boys, Cal quickly found a passion for athletics and graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1957. After graduating, Cal attended the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (UMES) where he received his Bachelor’s Degree in Physical Education and Biology before moving on to Old Dominion University to complete his Master’s Degree in Counseling.

All of this is important, because Cal spent the next 42 years of his life working in education.

Utilizing his Bachelor’s Degree, Cal taught elementary school P.E. and high school biology, and then made his way to Assistant Principal in Discipline. However, after only one year in administration, Cal returned to teaching. His passion for his students was too strong for him to be removed from the classroom.

Throughout his time teaching, Cal also influenced students in another way; he was the head varsity coach of Booker T. Washington High School’s football team for 20 years. It’s here, on the football field, where Cal’s true love for sports and education really shined through.

With Cal’s background in physical education and counseling, the football field was not just 120 yards of grass where players ran and threw passes. For many, the football field was a place of healing and self-discovery.

“Dad served as a father-figure to countless numbers of young people in the community, many of whom have expressed how instrumental Dad's influence was in making them into the successful person they are today,” said Sharon Davidson Cook, Cal’s daughter. “I never realized how deep his impact ran until my family made his illness and later his death public.”

Cal’s family and friends, along with countless past players and students, are petitioning to have the football field at Booker T. Washington High School named after him—Cal Davidson Field.

“Our intent is only to honor the legacy of Cal Davidson,” Mrs. Davidson Cook said, “including Coach Hank Sawyer who has been Lake Taylor High School's head football coach for several years and who says his team's state championship rings actual belong to Cal Davidson because everything he does he models after Cal who was his coach and mentor back in the ‘70s.”

The Norfolk Public Schools (NPS) School Board and Norfolk City Council are reported to have said that no building may be named after any person unless they have been deceased for at least 10 years.

There are two problems with this decision:
• A football field is not a building
• A basketball court was named in honor of someone who was not deceased

Maury High School, another high school in Norfolk, named their basketball court after their retired head coach Ted Bacalis and his predecessor Jack Baker—Bacalis-Baker Court.

The argument is being made that an indoor basketball court is much closer to a building, by definition, than a football field. More so, Bacalis was head coach at Maury for only 18 years—two years shy of Davidson’s football coaching career—and was still alive at the time of the court being named after him.

While there certainly seems to be a double standard when it comes to naming places of recreation after coaches in Norfolk, Cal’s memory and legacy will always live on. Cal was inducted into the UMES Sports hall of Fames in 2006, and the Hampton Roads African American Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.

Whether or not Booker T. Washington High School’s football field is ever named after a coach, one thing is certain; Calvert Willie Davidson will live on in the hearts of the countless lives he touched.
