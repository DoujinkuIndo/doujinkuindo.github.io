(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No, because I was slow picking up what to do and in doing it and therefore didn't complete the code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I tend to forget what I am supposed to do after being told to do it so I found it more useful to insert the code in Scratch whilst Mr Keen explained what to do to us as opposed to after he explains what we should do. because I am not very good at IT (that's not an excuse) and am very forgetful. If I’m told to insert a specific line of code in a certain order and then told to do it I can almost guarantee I will forget completely what to do and (as mentioned in a previous post) I will tell myself I know what to do and do my own thing and get it wrong. Strategies that were effective and helped me complete the task easier were as I said: Doing what I need to do whilst being told what to do and being run-through it at the same time as I am doing it.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Things that limited my learning were all admittedly my fault. It was my lack of focus, not listening and doing my own thing that stopped me finishing the code which everyone else seemed to  manage to complete in the given time whereas I didn’t because of my bad habits of: Not listening, not focusing and doing my own thing. Bad habits I need to work on are the speed I take to do things because when I eventually did pick up what to do (which took a lot of time) I was extremely slow in just doing it compared to everyone else. Another bad habit I have is my tendency to not focus and get distracted preventing me from going further with my work.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will listen very carefully to what Mr Keen tells us to do and understand it and be engaged in the teaching instead of talking to the person next to me like I normally do. This causes me and the person I’m talking to, to not know what to do and therefore not be able to continue with the work whilst everyone else is getting on with the work. I also need to work on my focus as it is a big problem I have and I really need to start focusing more so that I complete more of what I should be doing in the time given to complete the work. This will improve my learning because focusing more on the task I’m supposed to be doing will allow me to complete the task quicker at a better standard, and listening more to what I’m being taught will improve my learning because I will the know exactly what to do and will have no need to pretend to know what I’m doing.</td>
