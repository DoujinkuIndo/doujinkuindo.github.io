# Unwind Yourself — Marva Whitney

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym7IOodKeWI I like rap. No, no apologies. I love rap. But normally I love rap for the poetry of its lyrics; I'm a fan of De La Soul and The Pharcyde and Das Racist and Aesop, for their lyricality. It's the largest modern source of poetry there is, and it's relevant and clever and unique. I was listening to _[History of](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EPl0OGz2Cg)[ Rap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EPl0OGz2Cg)_, and they played the song _Let Me Clear My Throat _— DJ Kool. What caught me here weren't the lyrics, it was the sample. ?uestlove and The Roots were imitating (live) a sample used in the 1996 song (which was recorded live) which used a sample from [The 900 Number](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axJpBlxW6n0) — The 45 King, a mid-80s sampling artist, who took a sample from the instrumental behind Marva Whitney's [Unwind Yourself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym7IOodKeWI), a 60s funk track. And yet the original shone through, translated three times. It hadn't lost its rhythm, it hadn't lost its tonality, it hadn't been desecrated in any way. I wonder for how many other oft-sampled riffs the same is true.
