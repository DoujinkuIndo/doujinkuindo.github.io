# Morning Has Broken — Cat Stevens

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP7Ry9MfkQU More sublime, strange wisdom from the mouths of youtube comments — the defense, that this has nothing to do with religion. Cat Stevens, famous for a public conversion to Islam at the height of his career, went on to write songs — but were they feel-good hippie folk songs about love and life, or were they subtle indoctrination, music with religious pretext, _foreign _songs about love and life? The answer is: it shouldn't and doesn't matter, but you knew that already. This is a song full of hope and wonder for a new day, in the way that only folk music can pull off, sentimental without being sappy, and above-all, honest and completely without self-doubt — this is a man who wouldn't think twice about writing a song in praise of the universe, as so many of us might.
