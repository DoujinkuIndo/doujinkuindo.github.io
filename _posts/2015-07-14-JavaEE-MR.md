The Java EE 7 Platform Specification ([JSR 342](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342)) Maintenance Release has been approved and is now available for [download](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr342/index.html) on the JCP site.

This Maintenance Release is clarifying some parts of the specification itself; none of the proposed changes is impacting the Java EE 7 Reference Implementation or the TCK.
