title: Standing Desk Idea
---

We're moving in May, and my new home office is going to be in a more public location in the house. That means I can no longer get by with the Frankenstandingdesk I'm using now, as people are actually going to see it out in the open.

Right now I like two different ideas, and it'll come down to space and cost in the end.

The first idea is my favorite one.

[This desk](http://wiki.colar.net/ikea_standing_desk#.VPu_h0YrNiY) was made by the writer of colar.net. I like this because it'd have all the space I need for my dual monitors, Kinese Freestyle, and Macbook Pro, while also having storage underneath for all the review games I still need to play and write up.

The second idea is much cheaper, and a bit more flexible, but not as functional.

[This one](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html) would only be around $22, and was designed by Colin Nederkoorn and  Ryan Witt. I'd actually probably need to make this a bit wider, but it's something I could put on another desk, and maybe even hide away during the holidays when we have guests over.
