Coming to the end of 2019; a year of varied, new experiences in work and relationships, a year in which some of the hardest circumstances have braught me face to face to with myself, only to emerge not less afraid, but only with more bravery and trust in myself to engage with the obstacle.

It's by engaging with difficulty that we can control its power to influence our emotions. It's here where we can see for *ourselves* our ability to adapt, and see through the self-talk and beliefs about ourselves. These beliefs can keep us tethered to past versions of ourselves, and can be overcome if only we *allow* ourselvs to be braver, and discover how true those beliefs really are.

Journaling can be a key part of our self-care, allowing us to discover patterns within ourselves otherwise lost in the fleeting encounters during the day, and to audit our values and reflect on behaviours, hiding bnothing from *ourselves.*

As part of my journaling practice, I decided to do a higher-level *Annual Review*, inspired by [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/annual-review) and his book [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/2Qt3trb).

As with a daily journaling practice, it's helpful to have a structure to follow to keep reflections focused and useful to allow easy re-reading throughout the year.
and what I wish to focus on.

As such, I have shared below my own journal 'template' for conducting a personal Annual Review. My hope is that some of these cues provide just the right jumping-off point for your own meaningful ideas to come forth in abundance, (or use it as-is!), to reflect on your year.

### Cues for your a personal Annual Review

So, here's mine; a structure I came up with to serve as a guide to reflect on the year.
My hope is that you might find some inspiration in these cues for your own journaling.

<hr />

**Review goals/intentions set for 2019**
Did I acheive or make progress on them? Are they even still important? If not, don't get hung up, tweak them, and take my mememtum into some new goals.

**Recall highs; lows...**
- How did I move through the lows?
- What behaviours or mindsets preceded these states?

**What worked or didn't work?**
 - Could indicate what to do more or less of

**Biggest stressors**
-  Could recurrence be avoided? What did I learn from them/identify any emotional traps that preceded them?

**Behaviours to cultivate**
- What values to bring to interactions, relationships. Use to informing choices of the right focus, media diet
- Any behaviours toward introducing something new?

**Gratitude for...**
Gratitude may be extracted from even the most trying of things; thinking about what you're grateful for helps us keep perspective through turmoil we'll encounter, and also to truly revel in our more mundane experience.

**Positive initiatives and learnings to take into 2020**
- Emotional pitfalls/patterns to observe
- Refining/levelling-up any new habits
- Clarity on what matters makes it easier to know what to focus on, and what to decline
- Improved understanding of myself/what I want to aim at

## Just starting

It can be difficult to *start* journalling; questions about time of day, frequency, what to even write, can thwart our motivation. But my advice is 'who cares!?' - just need to start, and **take the lead from what you find valuable** and the insight you'll start to gain about your very nature.

In doing a personal Annual Review, it can be difficult, even daunting to know what to write about for the *whole* year! I certainly found this and enjoy reading what others might include; I mean, can we really remember what we got up to at the start of the year, especially if not armed with a years' reflections to draw upon!

I quickly found, however, that following these cues and some quiet reflection, my memory was jogged, leading me to reflect on the outcomes of those interactions and challenges.

Of the events of the year, ask which were ultimately valuable to your growth, which were not, or caused undue stress or distraction. Then, how you might use this to be become ever-more deliberate in your focus.

Have a great, Stoic 2020!
