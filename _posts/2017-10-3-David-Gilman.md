Howdy, and welcome to my TAMU webpage! My name is David Gilman and I'm a Senior here at Texas A&M. As you can see from my included headshot, I love attending Texas A&M and attending football games, even when our team lets us down in SEC play. As part of the ISTM 209 course, I've created this straightforward HTML webpage to provide a little bit of information about myself as a professiona, student, and individual. In addition to some basic information about myself and my background, this website also includes a few pictures of myself and things I enjoy, as well as links to relevant information. You can also find a handy link to my TAMU email in the footer of the website. Lastly, you can find my resume current as of June 2017 in both PDF and .docx form. Feel free to explore more using the above links in the header.

As you can see, this is a relatively primitive webpage. The only technologies used to create it are HTML; there isn't even any CSS. While this is limiting, it's also a great reminder of the bare bones of the internet, and it has made for an interesting assignment. I am hoping to continue to update the content as well as the design of the site as long as I am a student here and have access to the page. Of course, one of the advantages of a purely HTML site is that loading times are extremely quick, and browser compatibility is not an issue. There is an argument to be made that the web would be better off if more sites took a HTML and text based approach. If you have any suggestions as to info I should include or how to better update the design, please reach out to me via my email address. I hope you enjoy my website and what it has to offer!
