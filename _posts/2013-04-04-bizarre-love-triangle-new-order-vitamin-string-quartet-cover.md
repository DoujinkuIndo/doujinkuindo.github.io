# Bizarre Love Triangle — New Order (Vitamin String Quartet cover)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnNOkJ6ysBA Let alone my personal history with this song — played twice a week, three weeks a year, six years — imbued with emotional and adolescent significance far beyond its origins or means — the formative soundtrack of my summers throughout middle and high school — it remains, in its [original form](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uEBuqkkQRk), drastically understated; the chords and lyrics could have been so much more than they are; this, the VSQ cover, elevates it, finds the platonic form of the music and brings it into such complexity and gorgeous arrangement; it reflects and references the original, but it works and soars and improves on it by far; I would rather listen to it than the original at the moment. Perhaps I'm just a sucker for string quartets.
