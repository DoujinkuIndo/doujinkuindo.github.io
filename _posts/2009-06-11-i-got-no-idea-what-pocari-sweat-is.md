Went to the Australia v Bahrain soccer match last night with my brothers and Dana. The Australia side was pretty lame, the only people I recognised was Schwarzer, Milligan and Kewell&#8230; We played pretty sub-par, a goal-less game for the first half but we powered on with 2 goals in the second to take the win. Eh, I won&#8217;t go on pretending like I actually know anything about the soccer&#8230; It was a good night anyway, even if it was freakin cold. Suprised I didn&#8217;t wake up feeling like death this morning.

Also, the Bahrain guys looked like Spiderman in their training outfits (click photo for full size):

Back to Pocari Sweat for a minute&#8230; It turns out it&#8217;s some Asian sports drink.Â
