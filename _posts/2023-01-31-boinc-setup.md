title: BOINC: donating compute
---

Ever since, but especially since my [RAM and CPU upgrade]({% post_url 2022-10-02-truenas-ram-upgrade %}), my server sits idle pretty much all the time.
So I thought:
can't I donate my compute resources?
For a long time, especially during COVID, I _actually did_ the same with my iPhone.
The Vodafone Foundation has brought out the [DreamLab](https://www.vodafone.com/vodafone-foundation/focus-areas/dreamlab-app) application.
It essentially computes exiting stuff like COVID research on your smartphones (yes! It is a computer) CPU and GPU (and NNU?).

So I sought to find a similar thing, but Docker based and for `x86` architectures.
