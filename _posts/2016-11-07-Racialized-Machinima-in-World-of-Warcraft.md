The research question, argument, and data will be discussed about “Don’t Hate the Player, Hate the Game: The Racialization of Labor in World of Warcraft” by Lisa Nakamura.

When playing video games, especially with fictional character it would be thought that race would not be brought into it but people still find a way.

RQ: How does machinima reflect the racial views of a video game community?
Argument:

1) On forums and in regular community vocabulary the World of Warcraft gold farmers are referred to as Chinese gold farmers.
Evidence: On a forum there was a poll about if it is ok to hate Chinese players and 32% responded yes and the majority responded with not hating the Chinese but for what they stand for.

2) The community machinima and other creative outlets show racism towards Chinese.
Evidence: The most popular machinima site has a lot of videos with about Chinese gold farmers, specifically with negative connotation but there are no positive videos on Chinese gold farmers.

Data:
The data seems to not be well supported. There are a lot of statements which are just opinion with no evidence like how most Americans think gold farmers are Chinese but they don't know their computer parts are made in China.
I will improve/fix this blog post today but due to my trip to SIU and terrible time management I can’t finish the blog before class.
