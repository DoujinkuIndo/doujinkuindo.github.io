Quote from an interview on the BBC:>"This economic crisis is like a cancer, if you just wait and wait hoping it is going to go away, just like a cancer it is going to grow and it will be too late!" via [BBC](http://www.businessinsider.com/bbc-speechless-as-trader-tells-truth-the-collapse-is-comingand-goldman-rules-the-world-2011-9), via [@mpesce](http://twitter.com/mpesce/status/118526867165814785)
