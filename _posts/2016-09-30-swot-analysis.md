## Communication Skills 
<h3>Reading and Writing</h3>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>When I took IELTS, I scored 8.5 in Reading and 7 in Writing. Thus I believe that I have sufficient skills in both areas.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Opportunities</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>Finding myself in a country where English is used on a regular basis, I have an excellent opportunity to practice writing and reading it regularly.</li>
     <li>My university offers a service called <a href="http://web.anglia.ac.uk/anet/studyskillsplus/">Study Skills Plus</a>, which I could use to improve in these areas, especially Academic Writing.</li>
   </ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>English is not and never will be my first language, so it might be that I'll never be able to match the skill of a native speaker (or writer, as the case may be).</li>
     <li>When presented with a large block of text, I will resolve to skim-reading it.</li>
   </ul>
<h4>Threats</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>Skimming through text could result in either loss of potentially useful information or misinformation.</li>
     <li>Using informal words in academic writing could result in a loss of marks.</li>
   </ul>

<h3>Listening, Discussion and Presentation</h3>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>When I took IELTS, I scored 8.5 in Listening and 8 in Speaking.</li>
    <li>I am used to speaking in front of large groups of people, since I used to attend poetry reading competitions.</li>
    <li>I have previously made presentations as part of my elementary and secondary education.</li>
    <li>I consider myself to be a good listener.</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Opportunities</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating a group presentation is part of the Core Skills module, as well as an excellent opportunity to improve in all three areas.</li>
    <li>Books on this subject area are available in <a href="http://www.johnsmith.co.uk/aru">John Smith's Bookshop</a>. I can buy these books using my <a href="http://www.johnsmith.co.uk/aru/books-plus-scheme">Books Plus Card.</a></li>
  </ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<h4>Threats</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>English is not and never will be my first language, so it might be that I'll never be able to match the skill of a native speaker, or at least the confidence of one.</li>
    <li>Despite the fact that I attended poetry reading competitions, I still get anxious before public speaking.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>My shy nature could possibly hamper any opportunities for discussion.</li>
  </ul>

              <li>On the other hand, I could spend too little time volunteering and socializing, which I believe to be crucial activities to a fulfilling and successful student life.</li>
