title: 100kHz - 10MHz Bias Tee
---

Another little while has passed! Hard to believe it’s almost been a full year, I keep forgetting to blog. 

This summer, I had the absolutely amazing opportunity to work on designing a bias tee in an internship at Sunnybrook Hospital with my supervisor, Alex. It’s to be used in a hydrophone pre-amp circuit for focused ultrasound benchtop projects. 

We wanted a bandwidth of 100kHz - 10MHz for the bias tee, since those were the range of frequencies we expected to be getting from the op-amp. To that end, we adapted the bias tee from [Gary Johnson’s design](http://www.wb9jps.com/Gary_Johnson/Bias_Tee.html). His bandwidth was a little too large for our needs (100kHz - 2GHz), so I was responsible for cutting down some of the parts and adjusting their values in LTSpice. 

We used three measurements to determine the performance of the bias tee: insertion loss, return loss, and isolation. Our ideal values within the bandwidth (100kHz - 10MHz) for the were around 0.3dB or less for the insertion loss, 20dB or more for the return loss, and 20dB or more for the isolation. These values were also based off of the values for Gary Johnson’s bias tee. 

This is the final design.

These are the graphs for the insertion loss (s21), return loss (s11), and isolation (s31) respectively.

![Isolation loss.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Picture1.png "Isolation loss.")

The insertion loss does undershoot 100MHz by a bit, and if that needs to change, then the value of resistor R8 can be adjusted. I don’t fully understand this myself, but apparently the second AC source AC2 is added to extract s11, the return loss. I believe that Gary Johnson made a post about it here: https://www.edaboard.com/threads/bias-tee-design-or-circuit.135389/#post-593992 Further improvements can also be made by changing the coupling capacitor C1 to several capacitors in parallel, though I have not extensively tested this (I did split C1 into two capacitors of 0.035u each, and the results seemed similar to the ones above). In addition, the series resistances and parallel capacitances from the capacitors and inductors may not match those that will be used in reality, so those will need to be accounted for. 

The insertion loss indicates that the bias tee has a bandwidth of 100kHz - 100MHz, which we did anticipate that the frequencies used might go up to 20MHz under extreme circumstances. Given this, I think that it should be safe to use the bias tee with frequencies above 10MHz, but the reliability may be questionable at very high frequencies. 

We never actually got around to building it while I was still an intern, unfortunately, so I may never see the outcome of my simulations (or at least not for a very long time.) 

This week’s book recommendation is The Accidental Highwayman by Ben Tripp. It’s not a deep read by any means, it’s just a fun read to get sucked into after a very long day. I’ve been having lots of those lately, especially with upcoming university applications…
