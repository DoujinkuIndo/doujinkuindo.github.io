title: Welcome to my blog!
---

This is my first official post (as there was already a generated post in the template I used). I'm still using this personal website as a sort of sandbox that allows me to try and learn jekyll alongside Github Pages. Why am I not simply testing it locally? Well it's not the only purpose of this blog, I also really want to start blogging on several subjects.

Often when searching for technical stuff to solve a particular problem, I end up not finding what I wanted, and had to resort to making my own solution. Sometimes those solutions were so simple and so easy to do that I felt I could share them to the world. Because even though the solution can be quite simple, it still might have taken someone hours of thinking just to come up with it, so If I can save someone those few hours, then all the better!

I'm also not very fluent in English, as my first language is French from Quebec, so this blog is also a way for me to get better in English. If there are any mistakes/typos in the following blog posts, feel free to drop me an e-mail (or possibly a comment, maybe that feature will come soon enough).
