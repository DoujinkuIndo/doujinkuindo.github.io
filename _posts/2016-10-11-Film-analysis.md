"Every Single Word Spoken by a Person of Color in [Mainstream Film Title]" is a new Tumblr 
project by Welcome to Night Vale's Dylan Marron

Similar to the Bechdel Test, which is meant to gauge gender representation in movies

11 percent of the speaking characters were black, while 5 percent were Hispanic, 4.2 percent were
Asian, and 3.6 percent were other (or mixed race) ethnicities, despite the fact that non-whites 
make up about 44 percent of the people who go to the movies, and a much higher percentage of people 
who exist in the world.
