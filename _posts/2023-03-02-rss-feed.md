This blog now has a feed to which you can subscribe using the 
RSS logo at the top or at the bottom of the page. Or by clicking [here](/blog/feed.xml).
Updates to this blog are not frequent, but they are mostly high-effort posts
and I am happy if they reach a lot of people, so if you like my stuff please
subscribe :)

The feed uses the [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) gem, which
is very simple to set up. If you've read this far, then you have surely spotted
my lie. The feed is not really an RSS feed... it's an Atom feed, but the typical
feed readers can usually parse both.
