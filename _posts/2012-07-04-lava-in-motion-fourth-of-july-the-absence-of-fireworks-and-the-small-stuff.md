# Lava in Motion: Fourth of July, the Absence of Fireworks, and The Small Stuff

Cogs in motion again. Coming around the bend. Like a volcano bubbling over, like the lava flowing down the sides and filling a valley, where it crackles and boils until the surface tension breaks and it begins to pop. And sometimes there's a rise that leads to a break, and sometimes there's a rise that leads to nothing at all. And sometimes there's just a break, coming from nothing, a flat patch of lava that decides to burst for some spontaneous reason. Sushi didn't go according to plan, but it was wonderful anyway. Trains ran late. We'd already seen the movie. The lines were long. We couldn't even see the fireworks. Crowds were hell. Walked home 60 blocks. But it was all absolutely lovely. A person didn't show up for sushi, so we all got more. Trains ran late, but it meant we didn't have to kill time standing around outside a theater. The movie was guaranteed to be excellent - and it was. The lines moved fast. We saw the reflections of fireworks, heard the booms, saw the crowds - and got to sit down and eat the whole time; got to stand on a rooftop over Times Square. Got through the crowd, and caught up like old times on a sixty-block walk home. We spoke of escapism - how to deal with your problems, and if not dealing with them was an acceptable solution. Better yet is to ignore them. Know which ones matter. My day went horribly askew - and I really, truly enjoyed it because of that. Don't sweat the small stuff - and everything is, to some degree.
