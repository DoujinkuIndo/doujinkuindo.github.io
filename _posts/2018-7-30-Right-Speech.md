Definition from the suttas.

> _"And what, bhikkhus, is right speech? Abstinence from false speech, abstinence from divisive speech, abstinence from harsh speech, abstinence from idle chatter: this is called right speech."_ \[[SN 45.8](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.8/en/bodhi)\]

Criteria to identify right/wrong speech

> _"Monks, a statement endowed with five factors is well-spoken, not ill-spoken. It is blameless & unfaulted by knowledgeable people. Which five? It is spoken at the right time. It is spoken in truth. It is spoken affectionately. It is spoken beneficially. It is spoken with a mind of good-will."_ \[[AN 5.198](https://suttacentral.net/an5.198/en/thanissaro)\]

Right Speech as related to other items in Noble Eightfold Path:

> _"Therein, bhikkhus, **right view** comes first. And how does right view come first? One understands wrong speech as wrong speech and right speech as right speech: this is one’s right view. \[...\] One makes an effort to abandon wrong speech and to enter upon right speech: this is one’s **right effort**. Mindfully one abandons wrong speech, mindfully one enters upon and abides in right speech: this is one’s **right mindfulness**. Thus these three states run and circle around right speech, that is, right view, right effort, and right mindfulness."_ \[[MN 117](https://suttacentral.net/mn117/en/bodhi)\]
