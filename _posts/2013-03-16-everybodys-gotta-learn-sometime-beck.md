# Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime — Beck

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIVh8Mu1a4Q _Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime_ was originally by [The Korgis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5wkLnpJkL8), but the version I'm familiar with is Beck's cover (above), featured in the film _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_. For me, at least, it's inextricably tied to the movie. It's weird to only know a song from a film, but there's no shame in that. I only know [Mad World ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4)from Donnie Darko (which I haven't even seen!) I only know [Where Is My Mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCD14IrOcIs) from Fight Club. I only know [Johnny B. Goode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1i5coU-0_Q) from Back to the Future. Worst of all (or maybe best) I first heard _[Hallelujah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR0DKOGco_o)_ in 2001 (god _damn_, I was in first grade) — not the Leonard Cohen version, nor the John Cale, nor the Jeff Buckley. It was the Rufus Wainwright version that found me. It was on the soundtrack to Shrek. Even in first grade, I was ashamed that such a good song had reached me through an animated film.
