title: HPX 2010 - The Hold Steady + highlights
---

This past weekend, A, Meg, M and I took in some shows as part of the [2010 Halifax Pop Explosion](http://halifaxpopexplosion.com/).

As I wrote earlier, the show that was at the top of the list was [The Hold Steady](http://theholdsteady.net/) at The Paragon. I also wanted to see [North of America](http://www.myspace.com/northofamericaband) and [Rockets Red Glare](http://www.myspace.com/rocketsredglare), as well as [Cuff the Duke](http://www.cufftheduke.ca/) and [Tokyo Police Club](http://tokyopoliceclub.com/), but both of those shows were sold out (advance) and at capacity when we arrived.

So, we arrived at The Paragon on Friday night to a fairly small crowd. We actually didn't have to wait in line at all, though we did arrive around 9pm.

The lineup went like this: Bike Rodeo, English Words, Great Bloomers, The Hold Steady.

First up, [Bike Rodeo](http://www.myspace.com/bikerodeo) put on a great show. They're from Halifax, and have a pretty straight-forward rock sound, but with a few twists. Interesting timings, dueling vocals and great guitar tones made for a very enjoyable set.

Next came [English Words](http://www.englishwordsband.com/shows.htm). I'll be honest and say that this was my least favorite set of the night. The band was talented, but nothing I hadn't seen before, and after discussions with a few others, we agreed that Bike Rodeo could have been granted 2nd spot on the roster and the show would have flowed a bit better.

Third on the list, [Great Bloomers](http://www.myspace.com/greatbloomers). At times a bit more country flavored than I had anticipated, Great Bloomers are a fantastically tight alt-rock-folk-country band from Toronto. I shot the video below of the band performing their song "Small Town Love".

Last, and most certainly not least, [The Hold Steady](http://theholdsteady.net/). These Brooklynites crushed the place. Their stage presence was unparalleled, they engaged with the crowd, and nailed every song. Face-melting guitar solos, chest-caving bass, and Craig Finn plays the refined but awesomely sarcastic frontman.

I recorded a fair amount of video of these fine gentlemen as well, but being closer to the stage, and due to them being significantly louder than everyone else, the sound on the video is kind of distorted. I'll clean it up tonight and post some of that footage as well.

More on our HPX experience later today or this evening.
