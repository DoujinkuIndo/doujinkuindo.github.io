This is just some general information and links about the issues in Ohio, or, more specifically, the issues I'll get to vote on, this November. I'm going to just put information here, and not say what should the vote be. The links I put might, however.

### State of Ohio Proposed Constitutional Amendments

#### Issue 1 : Proposal to establish the bipartisan Ohio Redistricting Commission

#### Issue 2 : Proposal to prohibit any petitioner from using the Ohio Constitution to grant a monopoly, oligopoly, or cartel

#### Issue 3 : Proposal to permit marijuana growing, cultivation, extraction, & manufacturing facilities, retail stores & not-for-profit medical marijuana dispensaries

### Proposed Tax Levy

#### Issue 13: Sinclair Community College Current Operating Expenses

Additional 1 mill for the purpose of capital improvements & essential educational operations, starting 2016 and lasting for 8 years. A "mill" is a thousandth of a dollar, like a cent is a hundredth of a dollar. This is per dollar taxed, probably property tax. In Dayton I think it's 35% of what Dayton asseses the value of your property. So, if Dayton thinks your house is worth $100,000, then you're taxed on $35,000, so this tax would increase your taxes by $35 a year.
