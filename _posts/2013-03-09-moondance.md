# Moondance — Van Morrison

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rovxbHeGNVo I remember dancing to this song at pre-primary school graduation. A decade and a half later, I can still remember my kindergarten teacher telling us to draw the first letter our names with our feet if we got panicked and forgot the moves. I don't know much about Van Morrison (other than the requisite _Brown Eyed Girl_), but I know jazz-folk when I hear it, and Van Morrison's Irish accent is unmistakable. Somehow the song stuck with me throughout a decade and a half. This winter, at a Christmas party, I was playing ambiance for the room; as much gentle jazz piano as I could. Eventually, I began to run out of songs I knew, and somehow the Brubeck I was butchering became _Moondance_, and only afterwards did I realize what I'd been playing.
