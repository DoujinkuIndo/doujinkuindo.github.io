# Smoked Glass

We’re old enough to implicitly trust the rebar framework of the scaffolding, but young enough to climb up it haphazardly, shifting back and forth within the levels of the small barred passage that ascends the inner curve of a large metal wall. A hundred feet above the ground, it opens up into the oculus of the white dome, suspended ten stories up, on a converted shoe factory in St. Louis, Missouri. We are at City Museum.

On the roof of the dome, the crown jewel of the Museum is an enormous sculpture of a praying mantis. It looks East, towards the darkening afternoon sky. The sun and the heat have broken.

In line, with our backs to the shallow part of the dome, we shuffle the perimeter of the roof; our gaze turns West, then North, as we circle around towards the small salvaged Ferris wheel, which some poor Midwestern Engineer had to find, fix, and test thoroughly. It can’t handle more than ten or twelve people, but it’s stable and sturdy enough to run fast, bringing us easily another hundred feet above the roof.

At a distance, the city resolves itself into a suburban grid, peppered with church spires and football fields, eventually fading into the sweet oblivion of forested hills. Forests and hills seem to be unique here in Missouri. It is a reprieve from the flat prairies of Illinois.

As soon as we have risen to the top, we cycle down again. The ferris wheel’s turnover pushes us to a new section of the roof: a large concrete slide which deposits us at a stairwell, a one-story simulacrum of the ten-story stairwell-turned slide beneath. A short wait puts me at the head of this slide, turning tightly clockwise for ten stories downwards, past a tall, narrow atrium full of organs. The slide is well-polished by the gym shorts of ten thousand tourists, and it spits me out at the bottom of a large glowing grotto of faux-stone.

City Museum is a carnival, an architectural salvager’s fever dream. A room full of doorknobs, gears, and cornices; an enormous functioning pencil which must be sharpened monthly; a large ball-pit; thirty slides. It doesn’t merely assault the senses; it batters them. The building is sturdy and complex, a maze constantly looping in upon itself.

Occasionally, however, I find a moment of peace and tranquility amongst it all. A five-minute army crawl sends me under the bleachers of a carnival stage; a maze of concentric circles, with lower and lower ceilings as you go. On my hands and knees, I can see ten feet around the bend in front of me. On my stomach, I can barely look up.

I reach a dead-end. There is a large smoked-glass wall, letting enough light into the maze to get around. I can’t get through it, and I can’t turn around.

Yet there is no fear: I look up, and there’s a small circular opening with light at the top. I rotate onto my back and twist up into it.

City Museum is a nearly solipsistic experience; a microcosm. It seems to reaffirm our suspicions that the universe exists solely for us.

I come away from the weekend with bruised elbows and knees, a filthy white t-shirt, a small cut on my ankle, and a delirious sense of wonder.
