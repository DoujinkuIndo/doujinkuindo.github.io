#1. US apportionment as a matter of algebra
In my previous post I discussed the Parliamentary apportionment in Thailand, and in the bibliography section I leave a remark that apportionment may be an important issue in US politics as well. Here in this post, I will give the readers a fun algebra problem around 2000 U.S. election, the most contentious one by far, Bush V. Gore.


The U.S. Constitution mentioned the term apportionment:

 "Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed."

The key word is "according to their respective numbers". The Constitution left it to the House to decide how to calculation the apportionment. The issue is that exact proportionality is impossible due to the combination of two reasons: 1. the number of seats must be an integer; 2. the number of seats in the House are fixed. To accommodate these two reasons, a number of methods were devised.

We will consider 5 methods that were at one time used in US apportionment, the strength and weakness of each methods, and how each one can decide the 2000 US president. But now let us take a detour to look at the 2000 race.

#2. Bush V Gore

I assume the readers know  the electoral college; but many might not know how many of them there are and what is the connection to the House apportionment. Currently, we have 538 electoral colleges. The number of Electoral college of each state is the number of representatives plus the number of Senate; hence the connection to the House apportionment problem. Washington D.C. is a special case, whose electoral college is equal to that of the least populous state. So in total we have 435 house seats + 100 senators + 3 from D.C. making up 538 electoral colleges.

Bush narrowly won the razor-thin race in Florida and got 271 votes, while Gore got 267 votes (he actually got 266 votes after one E.C. casted a protest vote). Now there are so many issues one can talk about this election, ranging from the infamous hanging chads, the butterfly ballots of Palm Beach county, the supreme court decision to stop the recount. But let us consider in this very tight margin, can we reapportion the house seats such that the outcome be different? The answer is yes. In fact, we can arrange it so that we get a tie, and the last vote would be casted in the House of Representatives. So now that we know what at stake, let get back to what are the 5 methods.

#3. 5 methods of apportionment considered

The re-apportionment is generally done every decade, following a decennial census. US

3.1 The Jefferson method (invented by Thomas Jefferson) was the first method used from 1790 to 1832.
3.2 The Webster method (invented also by a famous stateman Daniel Webster) was used from 1840 to 1850.
3.3 The Hamilton method (proposed by Alexander Hamilton, also a stateman) was used from 1850 to 1900. This method although seemed to round the seats well, introduced a number of paradoxes and absurdity to apportionment, Finally, the Webster method was re-introduced in 1911 til 1940.
3.4 The Huntington-Hill (by two mathematicians Edward Vermilye Huntington, Joseph Adna Hill) method was introduced in 1941, and is still the method used today.
3.5 The Dean method (by James Deam a professor of Astronomy at Dartmouth college). This method was never used.

So let's see the code for each method.
