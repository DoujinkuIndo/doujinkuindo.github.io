This is my first post using Jekyll as a blog framework.

If you want to start you own blog then head over to [Barry Clark's: Build a Blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

Or go directly to [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
