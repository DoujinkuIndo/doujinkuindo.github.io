Digital Humanities is the study of Humanities using digital media. It is a very broad definition, that encapsulates many topics. So what do I want to get out of it, and what am I attempting to learn in the class? In the first two weeks of class, I have noticed many coders in the room, including the professor. Being an engineering major, my knowledge of coding is limited, though I have dabbled in the arduino SDK. I've noticed the clever ways that a lot of the coders were able to use code to help develop their projects. In class I was able to watch the professor create and upgrade a website to her liking in real time. Seeing the terminal fill with words and symbols that I code only decipher half of was interesting. I would like to personally learn more about coding, and how I can use to push my skills both as an engineer and as a digital humanities student. The class has been very interesting to sit in on, and the last lecture about visual representing a poem really stretched how I thought about literature. I am excited to see what this class has in store for me.
