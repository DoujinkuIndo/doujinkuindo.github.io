title: Idea goes here
---

Based on the [someone](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-the-luckiest-guy-on-the-planet-in-4-easy-steps/) I am here to execute my ideas. 

I have many ideas and one of them is to get job at Automattic. Since startup culture is very fast paced and insted of the resume they want projects portfolio. So what is better to share than on github. I do not want to maintain everything myself and then look at them. Let the github do the work for me. 

So my *data science* and *computer vision* projects will go here. They will be open on the [github](http://github.com/avs20) and the details on them will go on this blog post. 

There are many more blogs of mine. Feel free to visit them.

Thats all for now! I will be updating this blog every week with new data insights. Hope I get selected at Automattic.
