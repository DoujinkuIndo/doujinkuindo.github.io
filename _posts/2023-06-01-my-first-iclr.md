#### Welcome to Beautiful Kigali

To be very honest, it was a brilliant stroke of fortune that gave me the chance to attend this year's ICLR. 
For years, even prior to the pandemic, I had heardd all kinds of visa horror stories from would-be participants of some of the world's top conferences.

Enter COVID-19: the playing field for events was leveled, and we were all reduced to faces and names on Zoom screens, even for the world's most exclusive events.

I don't know if that's what made it click, or if it was the fresh community push towards equity or equality that ultimately caused the change,
but whatever it was, I am grateful, because, for the first time, ever, the ICLR happened on African soil here in Kigali, where I just happened to have moved to complete grad school, and settled into work. ðŸ˜…

Talk about auspicious!

I know I'm not the only one who appreciated the opportunity. As you'll see in the image below, African registration was up to 261 from 16 at the last in-person ICLR event.
That's a whopping **1,631% increase**!

Now that that shocker is out of the way... 

#### My experience:

<img width="800" alt="Name Tag" src="https://github.com/KayO-GH/kayo-gh.github.io/assets/18174012/86e300ed-4e66-4b09-9d94-6db4870e6b07"/>

The first thing you will notice is that my tag says Thursday and Friday. I completely skipped Monday to Wednesday for three main reasons:
1. The prices, my friend, the prices. (Many of the people who attend these conferences are sponsored by their institutions. I was there as an individual.)
2. I got a pass for those days through my [IndabaX Rwanda](https://indabaxrwanda.github.io/) participation.
3. I still had to go to work ðŸ˜‚
