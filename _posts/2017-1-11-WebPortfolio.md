## Environment
+ `Python == 3.4.3`
+ `Django == 1.10.4`

## Project duration
2017.1.1 ~ continue

## Summary
This is my first django project for Web portfolio.

## Main Text
I uploaded my source code in [Github](https://github.com/poqw/portfolio).
In the project, I used web hosting service by [pythonanywhere](pythonanywhere.com). 
If you create an account and launch a site as first on that site, you can get free web hosting service for 5 months.
And also, [pythonanywhere](pythonanywhere.com) provides web console. 
In my Web site, you can see the timeline table about projects I've done. And the table was created by [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/). I think it is very confortable of using and applying it.
With my fisrt project with django, this is a graet experiance of me.

## Result

[poqw's Web Portfolio](http://poqw.pythonanywhere.com)
