#### Summer of 2014 ####

<div style="text-align:justify;">It's been almost 6 months since my last post here, and so many things have changed since then. First of all, when I came home for the summer, my hopes were everything but up. I just wanted to kill the spare time and earn some small amount of money. It turned out to be one of the greatest summers in my life where I met so many great people.

Long story short - I found a job at coffee bar. One of the most special workplaces in the country for sure. The whole team of baristas was just awesome. Kudos to manager for being able to hire "right" people. Cool, awesome, friendly and fun. Every single one of them. I've worked at quite a lot of places but never seen anything like that: atmosphere, colleague and task -wise. Loved it. Thank you, Coffee Inn. You probably made me a better person, even I if worked there for only 3 months.</div></br>
