# Luxury Condos For the Poor — Double Dagger

![Double Dagger - Ragged Rubble](http://www.jbuckland.com/rome/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Double-Dagger-Ragged-Rubble-300x300.jpg) [Double](http://www.jbuckland.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Double-Dagger-Luxury-Condos-For-the-Poor1.mp3)[Dagger - Luxury Condos For the Poor](http://www.jbuckland.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Double-Dagger-Luxury-Condos-For-the-Poor1.mp3)   I don't think I remember any live musical performance I've ever seen more vividly as this song in October 2011. Double Dagger is renowned in hometown Baltimore - the infectious energy of their live performances is half their reputation. Unwittingly, I attended their last concert after nine years as a staple of Charm City's unorthodox music scene - certain to be an emotional experience for band and audience alike. I personally had never heard Double Dagger, only vaguely recognized the name, decided to go for lack of superior Friday-night plans. I had practically zero expectations. But _god damn_. It was like walking in on a supernova. However many people were in there - a few dozen, a hundred, two hundred - didn't matter. Just one terrific churning of energy, a single undulating mosh of people and screams and arms (with elbows). I've got this incredibly lucid snapshot in my mind of Nolen Strals wrapping his limbs around a support pole, his sunburn-pink face screaming into the microphone.  The cramped venue felt completely inadequate to contain the enthusiasm of the crowd _or_ the band; nothing malignant, nothing hateful at all, just the force of hot-blooded people who _loved the shit_ out of their city and its music. I can't ever hear this song without being immersed in all of it again.
