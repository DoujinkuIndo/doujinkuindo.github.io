title: A little bit of history
---

Like all great stories, it all started when I grew up playing games. I was born soon after the Nintendo was released in the US and I loved Mario/Duck Hunt and [Dig Dug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_Dug) on a random [Apple ][](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II) computer... until it broke one day. 

I was fasinated with these ethereal worlds inside a box. Thus began my interest in technology, computers, and games. 


# Tech bubble times

In 5th grade, I remember geeking out with the only other person that was interested in computers on Intel and the upcoming [MMX technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)). 

I played Chess during lunchtime and during recess I would play Kickball, philosophize, and talk to my friend about how his parents have a lot of stock in Oracle. 

Fast forward a few years and I'm learning how to type on an Apple IIe in school.
