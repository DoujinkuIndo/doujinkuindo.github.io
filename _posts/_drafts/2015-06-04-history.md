title: Some history
---

Like all great stories, it all started when I grew up playing games. I was born soon after the Nintendo was released and I loved Super Mario/Duck Hunt and [Dig Dug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_Dug) on a random [Apple ][](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II) computer... until it broke one day. 

I was fasinated with these ethereal worlds inside a box. Thus began my interest in technology, computers, and games. 


# Tech bubble times

In 5th grade, I remember geeking out, with the only other person that was interested in computers, on Intel and the upcoming [MMX technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)). 

I played chess during lunchtime and during recess I would play Kickball, philosophize, and talk to a friend about how his parents made a lot of money on Oracle stock. 

Fast forward a few years and I'm in school learning how to type on an Apple IIe and play Oregon Trail. 

## Then the tech bubble burst

I didn't know it at the time. If anything I was more worried about Y2K and then the 9/11 terrorist attacks. What I did hear about was how people were losing jobs. 

I decided that pursuing a tech career wasn't safe or any good.
