In this podcast Ricardo Rocha and I discuss the incredible scale of CERN's challenges, and how the infrastructure supports their work.

Ricardo is a staff researcher at CERN and co-chair of the CNCF Research User Group. We're joined by Alex Williams and Dave Zolotusky, the newest End User Representative on the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee. CERN do incredible things with K8s, Helm, Prometheus and CoreDNS and this podcast is really fascinating to listen to.

[Listen the podcast on The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/how-cern-accelerates-with-kubernetes-helm-prometheus-and-coredns/):


> CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is known for its particle accelerator and for experiments and analysis of the properties of subatomic particles, antimatter and other particle-physics-related research. CERN is also where the World Wide Web (WWW) was created.
>
>All told, CERN now manages over 500PBs — over half of one exabyte — which, in a decade’s time, is expected to total 5,000PBs as a new accelerator goes online, said Ricardo Rocha, a staff researcher at CERN.
>
>In this episode of The New Stack Analysts, we learn from Rocha how CERN is adapting in the next few years to manage 10x the data it manages now.
