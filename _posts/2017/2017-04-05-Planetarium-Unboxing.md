I'd been eagerly awaiting getting my hands on a copy of Game Salute's Planetarium for some time now. Thankfully I was able to take one home with me from PAX East! The game is absolutely stunning and I can't wait to get it to the table. Until then here some pictures of its unboxing. Note that my box had the Sci-Fi Pack #1 in it. I'm not quite sure if it comes with all retail versions of the game or not. It'll be the last picture in the set (the one with sandworms!)
