Lately, I have been seeking out quality sources for good 3D prints. In my search, I stumbled upon [3DPrinterSpencer](https://www.etsy.com/shop/3DPrinterSpencer?ref=custom_order_convo). Spencer McGuire out of Valdosta, Georgia, prints and sells a number of gaming items on Etsy.com (like this [charging dock for Nintendo Switch](https://www.etsy.com/listing/502645852/nintendo-switch-charging-stand-dock-3d?ref=shop_home_feat_3) or this [Joycon Mini-Grip](https://www.etsy.com/listing/517793039/nintendo-switch-joycon-mini-grip?ref=listing-shop-header-0)). In particular, his [Low-Poly D&D Tabletop Units](https://www.etsy.com/listing/499965343/low-poly-dd-tabletop-units?ref=shop_home_active_21) got my attention. The designs for these prints can be found [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1256348). Each unit is printed using a [MakerGear M2](https://www.amazon.com/MakerGear-M2-Desktop-3D-Printer/dp/B00ELUOERA/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489809128&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=gearmaker+m2) using [Hatchbox filament](https://www.amazon.com/HATCHBOX-3D-PLA-1KG1-75-RED-Filament-Dimensional/dp/B00J0GO8I0/ref=pd_sim_328_6?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00J0GO8I0&pd_rd_r=REJCP5K13TT6Y4YGJ6XZ&pd_rd_w=9wblF&pd_rd_wg=2dYPI&psc=1&refRID=REJCP5K13TT6Y4YGJ6XZ).

Currently, 3DPrinterSpencer offers 12 different units from several different factions:

* Knight with Sword
* Dwarf with Axe
* Elf with Bow
* Dwarf with Two Barrels
* Knight on Horse
* Human Mage
* Goblin with Two Swords
* Goblin with Spear
* Orc
* Goblin with Barrel
* Big Ogre
* Horde Mage

Each unit costs $1.50 and must be ordered in sets of 3 ($4.50 total). Whether starting a new RPG or tabletop campaign, designing your own game, or just want some company for your office desk, these units are a bargain. Like most 3D-printed items, they are a bit delicate. However, this is to be expected and overall they are of great quality and are extremely affordable. I already want to get my hands on a few more.
