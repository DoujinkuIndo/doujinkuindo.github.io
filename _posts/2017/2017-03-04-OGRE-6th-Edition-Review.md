<h2>Prelude</h2>

The last time I played OGRE was *years* ago on a paper board with thin, cardboard counters. I drooled over the [Designer's Edition](http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/products/ogredesigner/img/ogre_rulebook.pdf) when it came out, but there was no way I could afford it, or find a place to store it! I did end up eventually buying the [Pocket Edition](http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/products/pocketogre/), a faithful reproduction of the original, a few years back but it ended up getting lost somewhere on my shelves.

Then OGRE 6th Edition came along. Beautiful and modern, just like the Designer's Edition, just...smaller. More manageable. Time to relive my youth and share the experience with my kids. It's just a shame they won't let me play as an OGRE...

<h2>Play</h2>

OGRE is a game of futuristic machines of war. There are many scenarios that you can play, but the very basic has one player controlling an OGRE while the other has a giant force of infantry and heavily armored vehicles. Spoiler: the OGRE usually wins.

The basics of the game are very simple. Move all your units, attack, and move GEV units again. Combat is resolved by comparing attack values against defense values, figuring out the odds, rolling a die and consulting a chart. 3 things can happen: nothing, the unit is disabled, the unit is destroyed. In the case of an OGRE, the damage will be ticked off its sheet in the appropriate area.

Yeah. OGRES are a beast. They've got several weapons to deal with, along with their treads. Taking out an OGRE's treads early can slow them down. It's not always enough, though.

The full rules cover terrain, ramming, combining units, and more. You can take a look at the Designer Edition's rules [here](http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/products/ogredesigner/img/ogre_rulebook.pdf). They're pretty much the rules you get in the box with OGRE 6th.

<h2>Pieces</h2>

While OGRE 6th Edition is certainly a deluxe version compared to its roots, it still very much captures the feel of its ancestor. The board, while large and full-color, is still laid out in the same manner with minimal decoration. All the units are still cardboard counters, just larger to fit into the larger hexes on the board.

Where OGRE 6th really shines is the OGREs, themselves. These are 3D cardboard models that you assemble, and they're pretty damn big and impressive. There's also two command bases that are 3D as well, but it's just a nice touch, nothing as impressive as the massive, rolling, death machines.

Normally I don't talk much about the boxes games come in, but OGRE's box is a lesson in utility. It contains compartments for the fully assembled OGREs, as well as extra compartments for dice, terrain, units, and expansion material. The board fits in snugly over this to keep everything in its place without spilling out when you turn the box sideways. Thanks, SJG!

<h2>Perspective</h2>

So how does it all play? Just like I remember. I know the rules have been massaged and tweaked, but nothing feels like it's so different that it's not the same game I played back in the days of paper maps and small cardboard chits. The design itself holds up extremely well, and I had a blast giving the game a shot with my kids.

Of course, they never let me play as the OGRE. I need to look at some scenarios where it's OGRE against OGRE or else I'm never going to have a chance at winning.

If you're an OGRE fan that missed out on the Designer's Edition for one reason or another, this is the edition you're going to want to grab. If you've never played OGRE, give it a shot! You may not want to spend the $50 on this edition, but $3 on the Pocket Edition will get you into the game and give you a good feel if you're ready for some massive, 3D OGRE action.
