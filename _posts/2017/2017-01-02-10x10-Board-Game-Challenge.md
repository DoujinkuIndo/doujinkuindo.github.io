I've been seeing a lot of posts about the 10 x 10 Board Game Challenge now that the new year has started. The first place I saw it was on Tim Blank's [post](http://www.gameworthylabs.com/blog/578) on Gameworthy Labs' site. The idea is to choose 10 board games and play each 10 times over the course of the year. Not an easy task, and even harder since I rarely play many games multiple times with the revolving door of review titles coming in.

I'm not going to let that stop me, though. I'm determined to finish this challenge and think it'll be a great way to get some more play out of some great games that I normally wouldn't play with all the new games arriving.

I haven't decided what 10 games to put on my challenge yet. I'll probably sit down with the kids tomorrow and figure out the best ones to put on there. I don't want to put a game that will be *too* easy to get 10 plays in, but maybe one or two on there to help me move the challenge along will be a good idea.

If you're interested in taking on the challenge, chek out Tim's post with a downloadable challenge board [here](http://www.gameworthylabs.com/blog/578).
