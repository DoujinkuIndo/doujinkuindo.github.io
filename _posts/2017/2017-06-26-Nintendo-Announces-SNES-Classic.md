Today Nintendo announced the upcoming arrival of the SNES Classic Edition, another mini console, that will be released on 9/29. MSRP for this baby will be $80, and it comes with the system, 2 controllers, HDMI cable, USB charging cable with AC adapter, and 21 built-in games. What games are included? Here's the list: 

* Contra III: The Alien Wars
* Donkey Kong Country
* EarthBound
* Final Fantasy III
* F-ZERO
* Kirby Super Star
* Kirby’s Dream Course
* The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
* Mega Man X
* Secret of Mana
* Star Fox
* Star Fox 2
* Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting
* Super Castlevania IV
* Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts
* Super Mario Kart
* Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars
* Super Mario World
* Super Metroid
* Super Punch-Out!! 
* Yoshi’s Island

Notice Star Fox 2 on there? Yup. It's a sequel that was never released. There have been a few unfinished versions of the game floating around as ROMS, but this is the first time it's getting an official release. Of course, you first need to get your hands on a SNES Classic.

Nintendo had tons of supply issues with the NES Mini, driving aftermarket sales prices to insane amounts due to people not being able to find the system in stores. Let's hope Nintendo has learned from their past mistake and makes plenty of SNES Classics available to go around.
