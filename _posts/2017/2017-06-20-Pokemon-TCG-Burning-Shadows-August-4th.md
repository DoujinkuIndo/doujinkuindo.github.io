The third expansion in the latest Pokémon Trading Card Game series, Sun & Moon, Burning Shadows, launches on August 4th. The new set contains over 140 new cards including: Necrozma-GX, Machamp-GX, Charizard-GX, and plenty of new full-art Supporter cards. Burning Shadows' theme revolves around Team Skull and we'll see plenty of new Pokémon from the Alola region, as well as regional variants of classic Pokémon, make an appearance.

Pokémon TCG: Sun & Moon Burning Shadows booster packs will contain 10 cards, with at least 1 being a rare card.
