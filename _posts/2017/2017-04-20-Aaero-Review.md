<h2>Prelude</h2>

There was a time when rhythm-action games were all the rage. Over time, with a lack of spectacular titles, the shine kind of faded on the genre. Mad Fellows set out to change that with Aaero, a twin-stick shooter/rhythm-action game mashup. Published by Reverb Triple XP, Aaero is now available for Steam, Xbox One, and the PS4.

<h2>Play</h2>

In Aaero you control a ship and fly through levels Space Harrier style while an amazing dubstep/electronica soundtrack pounds out the rhythm for you to fly by.

There are three main things you have to worry about each level. The first is the light ribbon, which you have to follow to rack up points and multipliers. The second is obstacles that you need to avoid. The third is the various enemies you have to destroy. This part is done with the right stick for targeting and a trigger button for firing.

Of course, all three of these actions are timed to the music. The better you listen, the easier it'll be to figure out the patterns and perform better on each level. Levels are scored on a 1-5 scale with various amounts of secret targets to destroy in each one. On top of this, there are boss levels that have you trying to best giant creatures before the level ends.

<h2>Pixels</h2>

While Aaero is visually impressive with unique landscapes, enemies, colorful lights, and flashing projectiles, it's the music that really takes center stage. With a fully licensed soundtrack, you'll be on the edge of your seat cruising your ship through each level while fully immersed in an auditory wonderland.

The best way for me to explain it is for me to show you.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

Aaero is one of the best PS4 games I've played this year. Impressive visuals, amazing audio, and the satisfaction you get when nailing a particularly hard level combine to create a unique rhythm-action experience that you won't soon forget.

Whether you own a PS4, Xbox One, or use Steam, Aaero is a game you certainly shouldn't pass up, even if you're not normally a fan of rhythm-action games.
