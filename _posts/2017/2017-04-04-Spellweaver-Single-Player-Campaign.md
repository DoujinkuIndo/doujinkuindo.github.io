[I really enjoy Spellweaver](http://pawnsperspective.com/Spellweaver-Review/), a free to play CCG for the PC. The one thing it was really lacking was a single player campaign. That all changed yesterday when Dream Reactor released Spellweaver Chronicles #1: The Holy Child. The campaign brings:


* 15 new cards and 1 new hero
* 10 main missions and 10 side mission with unique gameplay
* Thought-provoking Hardcore Mode and tricky Challenges for added replayability
* Narrative Events that alter the playerâ€™s experience depending on his choices
* Intriguing story uncovering more of the Spellweaver lore
* Thematic cosmetic rewards for the completionists

The full release information can be found [here](https://spellweaver-tcg.com/spell_news/single-player-campaign-now-available/). I haven't fired it up yet, but plan to soon.

The campaign is available now and can be purchased in-game.
