I have fond memories of watching Bill & Ted's excellent adventure when I was 8. Their antics have stuck with me all the way to adulthood, and I'm still a fan to this day. Strange things are afoot at the Circle-K, and this time it's an excellent Bill & Ted board game by Steve Jackson Games. It arrived last week and the kids and I have already taken a go at it, so I'd better get pictures taken while I still can! Without further ado I give you Bill S. Preston, Esquire and Ted "Theodore" Logan's Excellent Boardgame.

Be excellent to each other. Party on, dudes!
