A few days ago [Eldritch Arts](https://www.etsy.com/shop/EldritchArtsUS?ref=l2-shopheader-name) sent me three of their more popular dice boxes to check out: [Deep One](https://www.etsy.com/listing/468786243/deep-one-rpg-dice-box-jatoba-brazilian?ref=shop_home_feat_2), [Elemental Flame](https://www.etsy.com/listing/455301526/elemental-flame-rpg-dice-box-jatoba?ref=shop_home_feat_3), and [Elven Tree](https://www.etsy.com/listing/460812228/elven-tree-rpg-dice-box-jatoba-brazilian?ref=shop_home_feat_1). Eldritch Arts is based out of Stanwood, Washington. They produce a number of beautiful laser-cut Jatoba (Brazilian Cherry) dice boxes that they sell on Etsy.com. Jatoba is a strong, wear-resistant, reddish-colored wood (twice the hardness of oak). This makes for a sturdy case to guard and display your dice set.

The detail on these dice boxes is excellent and Eldritch Arts offers about 20 different designs to choose from. Each box has a unique relief image laser-cut into the lid. The lid is held tight to the base of the box by two magnets ensuring that your dice don’t fall out. Each box measures roughly 6"L x 1.25" W x 1"H and holds a full standard set of gaming dice. Additionally, they are felt lined to safely protect your dice.

It is difficult to find any real “flaws” in these boxes. They are made in the good old U.S.A. and even smell like freshly cut wood. They sell for $22 each, not bad for laser-cut wooden gaming products on the market these days. If you are regularly rolling dice or looking for a good gift for a friend, this is certainly a great option.
