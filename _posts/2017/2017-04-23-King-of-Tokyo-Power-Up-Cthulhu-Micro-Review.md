My kids and I are longtime fans of King of Tokyo, though it had fallen out of play rotation a while ago. That all changed with the [2016 re-release](http://pawnsperspective.com/King-of-Tokyo-2016-Unboxing/) of the game. Not only have we been playing again, but IELLO sent over the Power Up! expansion of the new edition along with the Cthulhu Monster Pack. Power Up! is the game as it has always been, just update for the new edition's art and card backs. Cthulhu, on the other hand, comes with its namesake monster, Power Up! evolution cards for both King of Tokyo and King of New York, and supporting tokens.



*Copies of King of Tokyo: Power Up! and the Cthulhu Monster Pack were provided free for review by IELLO.*
