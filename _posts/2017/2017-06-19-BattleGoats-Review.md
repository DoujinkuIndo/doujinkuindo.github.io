<h2>Prelude</h2>

BattleGoats was funded on Kickstarter in May of 2016 raising over $9,500 from 331 backers. The game features, you guessed it, goats that battle it out for total supremacy in a mix of War and Memory.

<h2>Play</h2>

Playing BattleGoats is super easy. Each player is given a Hero card at random from the deck.  Then players get 8 more cards either at random or using a draft. One each player has their 9 cards they arrange them in a 3x3 grid and play begins.

Each turn a player chooses one of their cards to initiate an attack. They then choose any other player's cards to attack. Both cards are flipped and the card with the higher number wins. The winner is flipped back over while the loser discards their card. Ties see both cards discarded.

If that's all there was to BattleGoats it wouldn't be very interesting. Thankfully every card has a special ability that affects gameplay. Certain cards gain bonuses depending on where they're placed in the grid. Other cards may get bonuses based on how many cards are in your discard pile. There are even cards that cause opponent's cards to flip face up for the rest of the game.

BattleGoats ends when there's only one player left with any cards on the table.

<h2>Pieces</h2>

BattleGoats contains 55 cards in a heavy duty polypropylene box. The superdeformed artwork is cute, colorful, and family friendly.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

BattleGoats was a bit of a surprise. Normally saying a game is a mix of War and Memory wouldn't seem that interesting. Between a mix of excellent cards, finding the best way to layout said cards in a 3x3 grid, and tons of special abilities, BatteGoats manages to be an easy-to-learn, entertaining, filler game. A bit more depth can even be added the game by using the card drafting rules.

While it certainly won't be winning any awards for being the most thought provoking or strategic game, it's certainly got enough going for it to rise above your standard mass-market fare. It's light, fun, quick, and rugged enough to take with your wherever you go.

The catch? The price. A copy of BattleGoats runs $20. That's a lot of money for 55 cards. It's a game that feels like it should be in the $10-$12 range. If that price were ever to come down a bit it would make it a bit easier to swallow.
