I had only recently heard about Villages of Valeria and reached out to Daily Magic Games with an inquiry to review the game. A few days later the game showed up at my doorstep and now I can provide you fine folks with some pictures of what comes in the box. I'm hoping to get a chance to play the game this weekend and then get my review written up sometime next week. Until then, enjoy the pretty pictures!
