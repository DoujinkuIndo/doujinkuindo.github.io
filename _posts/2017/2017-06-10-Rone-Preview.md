Štěpán Štefaník has launched his Kickstarter for the 2nd edition of Rone – the post-apocalyptic strategy card game for 2 to 4 players. This Kickstarter includes not only the 2nd edition of the core game, but also the re-launch of the New Forces expansion deck. In anticipation of the launch, we were lucky enough to get our hands on a review copy of the core game and Rone: Awakening, Rone’s first expansion deck. First, let’s take a look at what is included:

The core set includes 156 cards, 40 tokens, 4 water resource dials (one for each player), and 1 color rulebook. Additionally, the expansion Rone: Awaking includes 100 cards and the newest expansion Rone: New Forces includes another 99 cards. The materials are top quality. The printing is bright and vivid on thick cards. The rulebook contains large print and full-color images on glossy pages and the tokens are thick-cut. Each dial must be assembled before play.

Each player controls a hero and plays units or one-time effects (tactics) in an attempt to destroy all cards from her opponent’s deck. The number of cards in the deck and the player’s hand is connected to the number of health points of the player's hero. For each point of damage that the hero receives, the player has to destroy one of their cards – from the top of their deck or from their hand. Once a player loses all cards from their deck and hand they lose the game. Because each card used by a player during the game costs them a life point, players are forced to play cards as efficiently as possible so that each played card does more damage to the enemy than to themselves.

Players earn resources to spend on various abilities throughout the game and these resources are counted using each player’s water resource dial. Being a post-apocalyptic setting, water is a fitting resource. Rone certainly succeeds in immersing the players into a sci-fi post-annihilation landscape of death, despair, and destruction. This stylistic immersion really adds to the distinctiveness of this game.

Rone’s straight-forward mechanics and extremely user-friendly rulebook make this game approachable and easy to digest for most gamers. By using level-up mechanics, Rone blends RPG qualities into a modern strategy deck builder. It did not take long before I was hooked. If you are looking for a Kickstarter to get behind, this game is worth come consideration.
