Faux-Operative Games had a successful Kickstarter campaign for Ruin of the Reckless, a pixel-art, fast paced, action rogue-like that focuses on melee combat and twitch reflexes. I was lucky enough to get an early build of the game to put through its paces and to see how it's coming along. It's quickly become one of my favorite games of the year so far, even with its brutal difficulty and my many, many deaths.

Ruin of the Reckless doesn't give you much to go on story-wise when you first start. You're dead, and your soul has been sent to the tower for eternity. Of course, if you can make it to the top of the tower there's a possibility of having a wish granted. With that, you're led through a brief tutorial on movement and combat before being let loose into the hell that is the tower.

The basics of the game are that your movement and aim are both independent of each other. You can dash, cast spells, equip skill orbs up to a level limit, and drink potions/use one-off items. As you progress through the tower you earn money you can use at checkpoints to purchase new weapons, boots, spells, orbs, and one-offs. There's also cards you can earn that can be activated to permanently effect the game.

Did I mention Ruin of the Reckless is hard? The game wastes no time is having waves of enemies swarm you over and over again. On top of that, each randomly generated level has a time level before the level becomes unstable and starts to rapidly drop stuff on your head. If you die, you start over at the last checkpoint. There's also a helpful character that will tell you how many times you died.

Yup. He's become my best friend.

Ruin if the Reckless is already feeling like a finished game and a damn good one at that. Faux-Operative Games has a real winner on their hands. Not only has the game been Kickstarted, but it's also been [Greenlit on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=683031395).
