*Once outlawed as a dangerous and radical sect of extremists, the Retribution of Scyrah has become the last shining beacon of hope for the elves of Ios. The Retribution is convince that by elimination the spread of magic among humans, it can halt the slow demise of the elves' last remaining gods and save their race from soulless oblivion. The Retribution's weapons and its warjacks, called myrmidons, harness the power of arcanika and tap powers undreamed of by the other nations of the Iron Kingdoms. Led by warcasters drawn together from the numerous houses and martial disciplines of Ios, the army of the Retribution represents undeniable peril to any who would dare threaten the Iosan people or the elven nation.*

With the arrival of Privateer Press’ June releases, the Retribution of Scyrah gets a big boost. Take a look:

As usual, bright, big, vivid color literature details the stat specifics for the command. Shown here is the [PIP 1086 Forces of WARMACHINE: Retribution of Scyrah Softcover](http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/books/retribution-of-scyrah-command). This book ($34.99) features: 

* Complete rules and profiles for the deadly warcasters and sleek myrmidons of the Retribution of Scyrah, including two new warcasters and a new character warjack.
* A collection of units and solos that can form the flexible core of your Retribution army.
* Detailed background information on the Retribution and Ios, including an in-depth look at their warcasters and myrmidons.
* A painting guide full of tips and inspiration to help you create an army as individual as you are.
* Three new theme forces that allow you to create specialized Retribution armies with specific benefits.

![Ryssovass Defenders - Retribution of Scyrah Unit](/images/privateerpress/ppjune3.png){: .center}

*The Nyss ryssovass were once proud defenders of the winding mountain passes of the Shard Spires. Having lost their sense of purpose after so many of their order were corrupted by Everblight, the remaining ryssovass relocated to Ios alongside their fellow refugees, where their frozen god is protected. They do not hesitate to join the Retribution of Scyrah in battle, seeing this as part of their sacred responsibility.*

The [PIP 35079 Ryssovass Defenders - Retribution of Scyrah Unit (plastic)](http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/retribution-of-scyrah/units/ryssovass-defenders) is really exciting. Set to release on June 28, 2017, this kit ($54.99) includes 10 30mm base, detailed plastic models—an uncommon release for Privateer Press. The Ryssovass Defenders boast Tough and Weapon Master alongside a moderate 10/16 point cost. When led to battle by Aelyth Vyr (PIP 35086), these grim Nyss swordsmen become the bane of enemy cavalry, gaining Hard. The Ryssovass pair great with warcasters like Dawnlord Vyros (PIP 35001) and Thyron, Sword of Truth (PIP 35064).

![Hemera - Retribution of Scyrah Character Warjack](/images/privateerpress/ppjune4.png){: .center}

*Designed for Issyria’s exclusive use and fitted with experimental technology that includes a cutting-edge arc node, Hemera magnifies the warcaster’s arcane abilities. The myrmidon wades into the thick of combat to take Issyria’s place, allowing her to guide the flow of combat more effectively without putting herself in harm’s way.*

Finally, we have [PIP 35081 Hemera - Retribution of Scyrah Character Warjack (resin/metal)](http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/retribution-of-scyrah/warjacks/hemera). Also scheduled for a June 28th release, this 50mm base Heavy Warjack ($54.99), is equipped with an Empowered Arc Node ability, making it an ideal warjack for spellslinging warcasters like Adeptis Rahn (PIP 35002), while its Mark Target ability makes it a favorite of Lord Arcanist Ossyan (PIP 35046) and Ravyn, Eternal Light (PIP 35004). When paired with its bonded warcaster Issyria, Sybil of Dawn (PIP 35058), Hemera provides its favored warcaster with a free upkeep in addition to its numerous other benefits.
