This week, [Cassie](https://www.facebook.com/cassiescuriosities) of [Cassie’s Curiosities](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CassiesCuriosities?ref=condensed_trust_header_title_items) sent over two dice trays for review. Cassie is based out of Watertown, New York and specializes in a number of handmade gaming and cosplay items. These [square wooden dice trays](https://www.etsy.com/listing/260452204/square-wooden-dice-or-jewelry-tray-with?ref=shop_home_active_34) ($20) are customizable with a number of paint, stain, and foam options. For an additional $5 you can also add a matching set of dice! Measuring 7” x 5” x 0.75”, these dice trays offer plenty of room for your dice to tumble and roll without the risk of colliding with game board components. Additionally, the foam-lined floor prevents your dice from bouncing out of the tray.

Shown here are two trays: stained-wood with purple foam and swirl-green dice and white with blue foam and translucent-purple dice. Each tray is handmade: cut, sanded, stained or painted, and finished. The wood trays are lightweight and smooth to the touch. And with some really wild foam options like sparkle pink, orange leopard, or blue zebra patterns, the possibilities are endless.  

I am always impressed with professional presentation of product, and this is no exception. The trays arrived packaged professionally, with a wonderful handwritten note, making these trays a perfect gift option for any gamer. Additionally, Cassie was generous enough to include a 15% off coupon code for our readers! Just enter “**PAWN15**” during checkout. How cool! These dice trays are truly one-of-a-kind, check them out!
