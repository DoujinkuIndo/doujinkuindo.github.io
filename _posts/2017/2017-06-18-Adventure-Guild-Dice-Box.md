[The Adventure Guild](https://www.etsy.com/shop/AdventureGuildLLC) sent us over a [Polyhedral Dice Box](https://www.etsy.com/listing/519956971/white-ash-wood-polyhedral-dice-box-for?ref=shop_home_active_2) for review! These handmade dice boxes come in a variety of wood materials and engraving and inlay options. Before I get to the details, letâ€™s take a look at the box itself:

This white ash dice box ($45.95) is sporting a custom Celtic knot engraving, with a 7-dice inlay, and an additional engraved message under the lid. Every order comes with a free under-the-lid message, however, the additional Celtic knot engraving on the lid exterior will cost you an additional $7. Currently, the Adventure Guild offers a number of engraved exterior images: bear, Celtic knot, crossed swords, dragon, howling wolf, kite shield, paw print, shield and sword, and skull. There are also three options for your dice slots: open center (no slots), 2 slots (two d20s), or 7 slots (d4, d6, d8, two d10s, d12, and d20). These dice boxes also have a magnetic lid to prevent unwanted spills.

Although these dice boxes are pricey (there are certainly cheaper options on the market) and take 2-3 weeks to ship out, they represent a certain level of craftsmanship worthy of the price. They make fine gifts for a gamer friend or yourself. If you are willing to spend, the Adventure Guild offers a number of more exotic wood choices: cocobolo ($80.95), purpleheart ($65.95), African blackwood ($145), and bubinga ($75.95). They look nice, on the shelf, or, on your tabletop during gameplay. Additionally, these dice boxes are smooth and slim and slide nicely into your backpack or bag for travel. If you are in the market for a new dice box, the Adventure Guild is worth a moment of your time.
