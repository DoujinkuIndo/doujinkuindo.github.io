“He says welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy.”

Hot Toys has just announced their Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 Rocket Raccoon (with baby Groot) figure. Available for pre-order now, this $200 figure comes with a [ton of stuff](http://www.hottoys.com.hk/productDetail.php?productID=464), including 2 weapons, 8 interchangeable hands, 2 costumes, 3 accessories (1 being Baby Groot in a Reaver outfit), and at least 2 heads. He's sixth scale, which comes out to 6.29" tall.

The deluxe Rocket is currently [available for pre-order](https://www.sideshowtoy.com/collectibles/marvel-rocket-deluxe-version-hot-toys-902965/) through Sideshow Collectibles for $227.99. While he's pricey, man would I love to get my hands on him. I've got the perfect spot in my cube at work for a gun-toting raccoon with the universe's largest attitude.
