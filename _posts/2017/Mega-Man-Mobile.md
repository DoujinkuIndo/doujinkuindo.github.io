Capcom has released the first six Mega Man games have been released on the Google Play store today.

They look terrible.

Aside from a terrible frame-rate, the games do no support a Bluetooth controller. That means you're limited to the virtual controls on the screen. These two things alone kill the twitch-based side-scroller that so many of us have grown up with and remember with such fondness.

Capcom seems to have blown this one. The games feel like a very rushed and forced attempt by Capcom to get money from nostalgic gamers.

Such a shame. The Blue Bomber deserves much better.

If you still feel like you *really* need to own these, the links are below the trailer. Each game will run you $2.
