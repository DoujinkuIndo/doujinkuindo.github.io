Today I received an email about Tokyo 42, a new isometric shooter coming out for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 later this year. Developed by SMAC Games and published by Mode 7, Tokyo 42 claims to be the lovechild of classic games Syndicate and GTA1.

In the game youâ€™re a  freelance assassin in a world where sinister forces are at play, taking on missions to pay your way and becoming embroiled in all sorts of cyber-shenanigans.  There are also cats, bullet physics, jumping with air control, sneaky stealth, and crowd simulation all wrapped up in a unique, visually stunning veneer.

There's no concrete release date yet, but preview builds will be going out in February. I'm hoping to snag one.
