Anachrony had a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign and is finally available for retail sale. The game comes in a huge box weighing in at a total of 10 pounds, all cardboard. While you can purchase minis for the game separately, I've jut got the base set. It hasn't hit the table yet, but I'm really hoping to get it there soon!

With that, let's dig in and see what comes inside this monster of a game!
