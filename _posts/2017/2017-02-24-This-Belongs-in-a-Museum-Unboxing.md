Rather Dashing Games will soon be releasing This Belongs in a Museum, the 3rd game in their Drawn & Quartered series. It's actually [available for pre-order](http://www.ratherdashinggames.com/this-belongs-in-a-museum) if you're interested.

They recently sent me the game, and while I haven't played it yet I was just able to snag some pictures of the contents and extra cards Rather Dashing sent over. I haven't played any of the previous Drawn & Quartered series games, so I have no idea what to expect. Looks pretty cool, though!

The first seven images are what comes in the box. The last two were in a ziplock baggie. I'm guessing a promotion or expansion.
