I hate to admit it, but I only learned how to actually play Backgammon a handful of years ago. Before then I just saw the came as something that came along for the ride with every chessboard I've ever owned. Once I finally learned how to play I realized how much of an awesome classic it really is.

Color me surprised today when I see an email come through from Brain Conceptual Entertainment about their new Kickstarter launching soon, [Lycans vs Vampires Fantasy Backgammon](http://www.brainconceptual.com/backgammon). Lycans vs Vampires is luxury Backgammon set that's just oozing with theme. Here are the stats on the thing:


* A wooden backgammon board, covered with printed artwork
* and varnished by hand, on each surface (Inside and outside).
* Board Size: 48 x 25.5 x 6cm (Closed) / 48 x 51 x 3cm (Open)
* The Hinges and clasps are metal made for strength and longevity with black finishing for a similar aesthetic result.
* Standard metal checkers set: 36mm x 3.5mm
* The 30 perfectly weighted checkers are specially designed, different color enameled and finished off by hand.
* Each set includes: 15 black Lycans & 15 purple Vampires
* 2 Acrylic dices: 16mm.
* Doubling Cube: 16mm
* Bag for storing checkers and dice.
* Bag to carry the backgammon board set.
* Weighs 3,500 grams (almost 8 pounds!)

The set should be hitting Kickstarter this month. No word on pricing yet.

The mockups for this beast look incredible. It's a set I'd really love to own.
