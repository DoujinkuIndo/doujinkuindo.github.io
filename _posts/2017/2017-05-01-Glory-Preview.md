Slightly Twisted Games launches their latest Kickstarter May 1, 2017. Glory is a competitive card game for 2-4 players. Although the age recommendation reads 13+, this is no doubt an adult-themed game. Throughout the course of the game, players—through various champions—collect resources, acquire spells, and combat creatures in order to turn the tide of the game in their favor. The Kickstarter box promises to contain a number of cards: 1 quick-reference guide, 6 playable champions, 5 cruel lords, 15 powerful elites, 25 confused minions, and 20 mystical spells. Additionally, the box contains a number of colored cardboard tokens, and the rules booklet.

Luckily, we were fortunate enough to receive a copy of Glory for review before the Kickstarter launch. After a few read-throughs of the 11-page rule booklet, we were ready to get started. My biggest complaint of the game was the learning curve. If you are looking for a quick pick-up-and-get-started game, then this is definitely not the game for you. Within a few pages of exploring the rule booklet, I was lost—the victory condition is not even explained until page 6. However, once you get the hang of it (like most games), it starts to come together. The object of the game is to amass 20 “Glory” or satisfy the victory condition detailed on your Devoted Lord card. However, this is no easy feat, as your opponents will constantly try to change the playing field by casting spells that often have a direct impact on your path to victory.

Glory is rife with gamer satire and trashy humor. The game components have an artistic and comedic edge that helps to keep the game interesting. Glory is a simple and inexpensive game with a lot to offer. If unique novelty-style card games are your thing, go and check out their Kickstarter.

*A prototype copy of Glory was provided free by Slightly Twisted Games for this preview.*
