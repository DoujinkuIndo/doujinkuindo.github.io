ThinkGeek has released a new edition of its classic [Bag of Holding](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/aaa5/?pfm=HP_TopCMD_aaa5). I've owned a Bag of Holding since they were first released and it's the best bag I've ever owned. Now it's showing its age a bit and it looks like the perfect time to upgrade has come along.

The new bag is a bit larger with a few more ammenities than its predecessor including a padded shoulder strap and a printed lining featuring hand-drawn gems, potions, shields, keys, d20s, and swords.

Like what you see? You should! You can [order](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/aaa5/?pfm=HP_TopCMD_aaa5) your brand new Bag of Holding from ThinkGeek for $49.99.
