Causal Bit Games is gearing up for their game, Battle Princess Madelyn, to leave Greenlight and set to release on PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U and Nintendo Switch. Similar to games like Ghouls N' Ghosts and Wonder Boy 3: The Dragon's Trap, the game will include ten levels which each have five stages, some hidden. Unlockable weapons, hidden secrets, and gameplay that both the novice and hardcore gamer can appricate are what await in Battle Princess Madelyn.

*When Creative Director Christopher Obritsch daughter Madelyn wanted to be in Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, and fight “Green Head”, he said it was someone else’s game - but he could make her one that was like it. “But girls can’t be knights, Daddy. Only boys…” she said, to which he answered “Pshh…What color do you want your armor to be?”. The answer? Pink! And that’s how this game started. Chris' daughter Madelyn loves the first stage of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts and makes him play it over and over because she wants to see him fight “Green Head”, the Shielder boss at the end of the first stage. It’s not hard for her to twist his rubber arm, as it’s been his favorite game since it came out all those years ago.*

**Features include:**

* Old School gameplay and presentation
* a mixture of gameplay styles all merge to become one polished offering
* Utilization of the Unity engine that brings a new edge
* Special weapons for special occasions - including combos

I'm hoping to get some hands-on time with this one at PAX East. I'm also hoping a review code will head in my direction!
