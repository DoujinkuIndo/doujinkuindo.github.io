I'm fairly new to Overwatch, having only been playing for a couple of months now. In that time I've devoured as much lore from the game as possible, so I'm pretty familiar with Doomfist, the latest character announced for Blizzards monumental game.

Yesterday a new article from the [Times of Numbani Staff](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/20877886) was posted on [playoverwatch.com](http://playoverwatch.com). The article detailed how Akande Ogundimu, Doomfist, was freed from prison by Reaper. This led the internet into a frenzy of Doomfist anticipation, a character players have been waiting to be announced since before Overwatch was even released. The official announcement came from Blizzard today accompanied by the above video. Doomfist is already playable on the Public Test Region, sadly only for PC players.

Doomfist is an offense character with [impressive set of skills](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/doomfist/). No word on when he'll be available for public consumption.
