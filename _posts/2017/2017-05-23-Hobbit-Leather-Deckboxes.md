Recently, I received a [leather deck box](https://www.etsy.com/listing/491858650/leather-deck-box-for-card-solid-leather?ref=shop_home_active_5) from Hobbit Leather Works for review. Based out of Częstochowa, Poland, Igor Kazibudzki of [Hobbit Leather Works](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HobbitLeatherworks?ref=l2-shopheader-name) crafts a number of high-quality, beautiful leather products.

This two-toned leather deck box ($51.40) is handmade and made-to-order. Packaged in a professional cloth bag, this deck box contains a stylistic brass-colored locking mechanism to safely secure the box from unwanted or accidental openings. This deck box is also available with a more typical snap-closing device for $47.34. Externally, the box measures: 9 cm x 11 cm x 6 cm. Internally, the box measures: 7 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm, so it easily fits a number of Magic the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, or other cards from most table-top games. Unlike [other deck boxes that contain a thick waxed-thread stitch](http://pawnsperspective.com/Manic-Leather-Deck-Box-Review/), this deck contains a small, tight stitch. Additionally, these deck boxes can be customized with unique tooling designs.

What impresses me most about Hobbit Leather Works is their friendly and professional communication. If you have a custom design idea for an order, just go ahead and contact them. You can also reach them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HobbitLeatherworks/). Because Hobbit Leather Works ships from Poland, if ordering from the U.S., expect a two-week turnaround time. I highly recommend this deck box, and I am excited to check out other great leather products available from Hobbit Leather Works.
