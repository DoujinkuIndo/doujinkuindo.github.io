![Magikarp Jump](/images/pokemon/magikarpjump.jpg){: .float-right}Have you ever dreamed of being the very best, like no one ever was? Now you can realize that dream...with your Magikarp!

The Pokémon Company International has just released Magikarp Jump, available for both [iOS](https://triplepointpr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1g8qlJhrLs7CU57_nXcwb1gL8iOz7utZXvtMJjk-Ewxo-1673822479&key=YAMMID-17428510&link=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fpok%25C3%25A9mon-magikarp-jump%2Fid1162679453%3Fl%3Den%26mt%3D8) and [Android](https://triplepointpr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1g8qlJhrLs7CU57_nXcwb1gL8iOz7utZXvtMJjk-Ewxo-1673822479&key=YAMMID-17428510&link=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Djp.pokemon.koiking).

Yes, Magikarp are weak and unimpressive. Yes, they're pretty much useless until they evolve into a mighty Gyrados. That all changes in this new mobile game! In Magikarp Jump players will train their fishy Pokémon friend to maximize their jumping power. Jump the highest to prove your Magikarp is better than all the rest!

What happens if your Magikarp gets knocked out? What if, *gasp*, they become TOO awesome? Retire it and start with a fresh flop!

Magikarp Jump is free to download and play, but also features in-app purchases to help you speed up your training, replenish food, and catch more Magikarp. There's also cosmetic items for purchase.

What are you waiting for? Get out there and make a splash!
