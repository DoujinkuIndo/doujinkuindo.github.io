Cheapass Games recently sent me two full Tak travel sets to take on Scouting trips since I've gotten the boys hooked on the game. A travel set is comprised of a [Tavern Set](https://thetinkerspacks.com/collections/tak-a-beautiful-game/products/tak-tavern-set) combined with a [Cloth Board](https://thetinkerspacks.com/collections/tak-a-beautiful-game/products/tak-cloth-board). It's a surprisingly small package, and an excellent value at a total of $34. You can actually go even $3 cheaper by buying using nothing but a [Collector Coin](https://thetinkerspacks.com/collections/tak-a-beautiful-game/products/tak-collector-coin) to mark the center of the playspace instead of using a Cloth Board.

Anyway, here's some shots of what the set looks like.
