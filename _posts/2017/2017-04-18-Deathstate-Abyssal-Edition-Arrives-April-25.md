Bread Machine Games describes Deathstate: Abyssal Edition as the best transdimensional, single-stick, indie, bullet hell roguelike, shooter RPG. Already out on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/402120/), it'll arrive for the PS4 on April 25th. The PS4 version will be an upgraded version of the game, containing tons of realms, bosses, relics, secrets and features added since the game's launch on Steam.

Deathstate: Abyssal Edition is a strange-looking game where you collect organs instead of armor, explore fractured realities instead of dungeons, and fight Lovecraftian horrors instead of fantasy creatures. Inspiration for the game's world came from The Binding of Isaac, Dark Souls and the Hellraiser movies.

I should have a key for the game tomorrow, so key an eye out for a review and some streaming soon.
