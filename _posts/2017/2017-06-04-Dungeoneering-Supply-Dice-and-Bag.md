Recently, Meredith Meyer of[ Dungeoneering Supply](https://www.etsy.com/shop/DungeoneeringSupply?ref=pr_shop_more) agreed to share some of her wares with us. Based out of Greensboro, North Carolina, Dungeoneering Supply offers a number of unique gaming supplies such as handmade dice bags and polyhedral dice sets.

Shown here is an ultra-soft [crocheted drawstring dice bag](https://www.etsy.com/listing/498318092/gumdrop-pink-dungeoneers-dice-bag?ref=shop_home_active_11) made from 100% acrylic yarn and featuring a 4” x 4” leather bottom. The dice bag is about 6-7” deep and is perfect for storing dice, rune stones, tarot cards, or whatever random items that need to be kept safe after a dungeon looting. The dice bags sell for $12.99 - $15.99, ship for free (within the U.S.), and come in a variety of colors. You can even submit a custom order if you’d like.

Dungeoneering Supply also carries a number of interestingly-colored dice sets, such as Turquois, [Dwarven Gray](https://www.etsy.com/listing/492298388/dwarven-gray-polyhedral-dice-set?ref=shop_home_active_9), [White Marble](https://www.etsy.com/listing/517664625/white-marble-polyhedral-dice-set?ref=shop_home_active_2), and [Marbled Purple](https://www.etsy.com/listing/522254813/marbled-purple-polyhedral-dice-set?ref=shop_home_active_6). These dice sets are made from pearly resin and sport painted lettering. They are truly unique and sell for $9.99. Although, sometimes you can catch a deal and pick up a dice set for free when you buy a dice bag.

If you are looking for some unique handmade gaming supplies for a distinctive gift idea or for your own game table, Dungeoneering Supply is definitely worth a look.
