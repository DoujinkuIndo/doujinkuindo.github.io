Recently, Joe Nittoly of [Pasiphilo](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Pasiphilo?ref=condensed_trust_header_title_items) shared two sets of his latest paper minis: [Barbarians](http://www.gaminggeek.ca/shop/miniatures/barbarians/) and [Rogues](http://www.gaminggeek.ca/shop/miniatures/rogues/).  Die-cut and double-sided with original front and back artwork, these 28mm fantasy cardstock gaming miniatures are an inexpensive and easy-to-assemble alternative to metal or plastic minis for your RPG campaigns or tabletop wargames. Just slot them into the bases provided and youâ€™re ready to play.

In addition to six round transparent stands, the Rogue set includes:

* A female dungeon delver equipped with climbing harness, grappling hook  and short sword
* A male halfling thief holding lockpicks and a compromised padlock, armed with a dagger
* A female swashbuckler in leather armour, armed with saber
* A male assassin in hood and cowl, brandishing twin daggers
* A female acrobat/tumbler in alluring garb with bracers and dagger
* A male diplomat/spy garbed in noble finery with a dagger

The Barbarian set includes:

* A duel-wielding female wild elf forest barbarian
* A male Norse/Viking style marauder with war axe and shield
* A tough but beautiful Amazon with longbow and shortsword
* A classic Conan-inspired male half-orc barbarian with maul
* A tribalistic male human plains warrior with spear
* A robust and curvy female half-orc barbarian with battleaxe

What is great about these paper minis is the unique artwork and attention to detail. The minis are double-sided, showing each figures front and back. This is a refreshing break from the typical minis displaying the same image on both sides. Additionally, each set is priced fairly reasonably, costing about $5-$10 per set. These minis come beautifully packaged and would make a great gift. I would definitely recommend these paper minis as a low-cost alternative to traditional plastic, metal, or resin minis.
