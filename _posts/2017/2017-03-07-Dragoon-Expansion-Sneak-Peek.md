I love Lay Waste Games' Dragoon. I love the design. I love the metal pieces. I love the gameplay.

I also love that there's an expansion ready to go for the game that just needs to be funded once the Kickstarter campaign for it launches.

Dragoon: The Rogue and Barbarian Expansion adds two new playable characters to the game, adding both variety to play and the ability for the game to handle more players. Each of these new characters has their own special powers that help them compete against the mighty dragons. The Barbarian can level up to use more powerful cards and also has a ship to carry gold. The Rogue has a useful set of tools to give him special abilities throughout the game. He also has tunnels he can use to quickly travel across the board.

Lay Waste Games was kind enough to provide a review copy of the expansion for me to take a look at. Here's some pics!
