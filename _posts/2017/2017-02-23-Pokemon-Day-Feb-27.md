Pokémon Day is coming up on February 27th and The Pokémon Company has a lot going on to celebrate! Here's the list of specials and events from the press release.

* Pikachu will lead the Pokémon Day celebration in Pokémon GO. From February 26, 1:00 pm PST, to March 6, 1:00pm PST, any Pikachu encountered in the wild will be wearing a festive party hat! The Pikachu caught during that time will keep its party hat, so be sure to look for this special Pikachu during its short time in the wild.
* Pokémon Day marks the debut of the new Gallery Figures collection in the Pokémon Center. The first set includes awesome figures of Eevee, Mew, Magikarp, and Pikachu—each performing its signature attack. These figures were designed specifically for the Pokémon Center, so this is the first time anyone will be able to get their hands on them. Check out the Pokémon Gallery Figures collection in the Pokémon Center (https://www.pokemoncenter.com/).
* Starting on Pokémon Day, revisit some of the best big-screen moments of Ash and his friends with a movie marathon on Pokémon TV. For a limited time, watch the original classic Pokémon: The First Movie, as well as Pokémon 4Ever and Pokémon—Zoroark: Master of Illusions in their entirety. Remember that you can watch Pokémon TV on Pokemon.com and on the Pokémon TV mobile apps:

[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pokemon-tv/id594261405?mt=8)\\
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pokemontv&hl=en)

These movies will be available for only a limited time, so don’t miss them!
* The Pokémon Trading Card Game Online is starting its Pokémon Day festivities early, with extra Trainer Tokens available on the Bonus Wheel for the entire week leading up to Pokémon Day. Then, be sure to log in to your game on Pokémon Day for an extra-special Daily Bonus. Remember that you can play the Pokémon TCG Online on your computer, iPad, or Android tablet. Battle today and through Pokémon Day for bigger rewards!
* Don’t forget that right now you can head to your local participating GameStop store to get a Bottle Cap for your Pokémon Sun or Pokémon Moon video game. This item lets you boost the individual strength of one of your Pokémon’s stats via Hyper Training, making the Pokémon even more ready for your next big battle! Bottle Cap codes will be available at GameStop until March 5.
* Pikachu lends its brilliant features to the new Pikachu Yellow Edition New Nintendo 3DS XL. This limited-edition New Nintendo 3DS XL is launching just a couple of days before Pokémon Day, and it’s sure to be popular, so check it out while you can. Visit the product page on Nintendo.com for more details.
* If you’re looking for even more Pokémon animation fun for your Pokémon Day celebrations, you can find Pokémon the Movie: Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel on the iTunes Store, Google Play, and Amazon Video. Plus, check out a special Pokémon the Series: Gold & Silver TV episode bundle featuring Ash’s adventures throughout the Johto region. With this collection of episodes and the latest Pokémon movie, you’ll be ready to host the perfect Pokémon Day party!
Pokémon Day is a good reminder that big promotions are going on in Pokémon Shuffle, too. The popular Nintendo 3DS game is celebrating two years of challenging fans with puzzle fun. Take a look at the in-game notifications to get more details on these upcoming opportunities.
