New Alola-themed stages and new Pokémon that hail from the Alola region are now available in Pokémon Shuffle, the free puzzle game available for the 3DS and mobile devices. 

Also, for a limited time, special stages will be available to try out the new Partner Pokémon. Play Litten's special stage until May 9, Popplio's special stage from May 9 through May 23, and Rowlet's special stage from May 23 through June 6 to try to capture these cool Pokémon.

There's also a login bonus of an Alolan Vulpix if players log into the game between May 2 and May 30.
