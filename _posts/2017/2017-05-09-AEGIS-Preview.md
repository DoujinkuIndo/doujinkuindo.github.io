<h2>Prelude</h2>

Do combat robots excite you? How about robots that *combine*? How about robots that combine in *multiple ways*? A.E.G.I.S. has you covered on all fronts. Command a squad of five robots of varying classes, Assault, Evasive, Guard, Intel, and Support, to crush your foes. Combine 2 or more robots to create powerful robots with the best of their combined classes for even more battlefield advantage.

Zephyr Workshop have launched A.E.G.I.S.: Combining Robot Strategy Game on Kickstarter for a price that won't cost an arm and a leg, but will let you combine robots to form them.

<h2>Play</h2>

The basics of A.E.G.I.S are simple. Build a team of 5 robots and a reserve deck of up to 5 combiners. There's a multitude of different robots to choose from in the 5 different classes listed above. Each robot in your team provides a certain amount of Energy. Added up the Energy creates a pool of points players can use during their turn. From there, players duke it out using Energy to move, attack, and combine their robots. 

Each robot has it's own attacks and abilities that relate to its class. Combined robots inherit attacks and abilities from the robots they're made up of. Combined robots can be as simple as two robots, example: an AS-Class would be the combination of an Assualt-class robot and Support-class robot, or up to a full behemoth of a five robot AEGIS-Class.

The game is won by destroying all opposing robots, disarming opponents so they can't deal damage, or draining your opponent's Energy so they can't take any actions.

For the full rules, see [here](http://zephyrworkshop.com/rulebook/AEGIS_Rulebook-5-1-2017-1.pdf).

<h2>Pieces</h2>

While the copy of A.E.G.I.S. I received was a prototype, much of the final artwork was provided. I can't comment on the quality of the components, but the actual graphic design of the game is looking great. Every robot has its own look and feel, while the combined robots look as amazing as you'd expect them to. The game is bright and colorful, making each class of robot easy to distinguish from the others. That, combined with (pun intended) a detailed, yet approachable, overall art style makes A.E.G.I.S. stand out with it's own style.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

I first had the opportunity to play A.E.G.I.S. around three years ago when they first starting creating prototypes. I enjoyed the game then, and was sad to see it never got the release it deserved. Then Zephyr Workshop teamed up with Greenbrier Games, drastically overhauled the art and mechanics, and really put the pedal to the metal hyping the game and getting it ready for Kickstarter. Unfortunately, the original campaign didn't fund due to several factors like a high price point, confusing entry (multiple starter sets), and lack of essential materials (no AEGIS-Class robots in starter sets).

The latest campaign, now indie again, fixes all those issues with a single, clear product, tons of content, and a much friendly price point of around $50. Everything needed for 4 players to enjoy the game is included:

* 40 Robots (cards/standees)
* 12 Terrain Tiles
* 30 Tokens
* 4 Commander Panels
* 8 Dice
* Rulebook
* Double-sided Board.

While in the original campaign you'd get a handful of level 2 and 3 combiners, you know get a full compliment including level 4 and 5 combiners. There's even a deluxe version that adds a neoprene mat, expansions, and a lore book.

My kids and I really enjoy the game. With simple rules, depth provided by team building/robot abilities/combining, and a play time of under an hour, A.E.G.I.S. hits all the right buttons for us. I'm glad to see they've cleared up their campaign, made it easier to get into the game, and made the price more accessible.

This is certainly a game to back.
