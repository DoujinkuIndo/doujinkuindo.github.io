[Lay Waste Games](http://www.laywastegames.com) announced a [print-and-play beta](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oszkzkn4fp7wi4r/DragoonExpPNP_Beta3.zip?dl=0) of their upcoming 5-6 Player expansion for Dragoon. The expansion adds humans into the mix, specifically a Barbarian and Rouge. Each has their own nasty way to play and cause trouble for those pesky dragons.

>The Rogue is a stealthy character, sneaking around other players, digging tunnels for quick movement across the map and managing a suite of six (6) pieces of equipment to gain access to all sorts of powerful abilities.
>
The Barbarian is an aggressive character, gaining levels by recruiting humans from population tiles to increase their ability to take on anybody!

I first got whiff of this expansion at the CT-FIG Mid-Year Event had have been waiting (im)patiently for a chance to give it a try.

Now I just need to grab some printer ink!
