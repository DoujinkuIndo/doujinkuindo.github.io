<h2>Prelude</h2>

A Day at the Beach arrived on my doorstep recently from Standard Games. Distributed by The Game Crafter, it's a simple set-collection game with a beach theme that described as part Rummy, part Miles Borne.

<h2>Play</h2>

A Day at the Beach has only a few rules. Draw one card, play one card. Be the first to collect two sets of cards and you win! In the game there's two types of cards, blue cards and yellow cards. Blue cards are the ones you're trying to make sets with. Each card will let you know how many cards make up a set, and which cards those are. Swimmers are sets of 4, while Flip & Flop make up a set. There's even a Treasure card that's a set on it's own.

Yellow cards are action cards that allow you to help yourself or slow down other players. A Pirate let's you steal a card from another player and play it. Others let you manipulate the Ocean. The Ocean is a set of 8 face-up cards that can only be accessed by using yellow cards.

That's it! Play one card at a time until you've got two sets and you win.

<h2>Pieces</h2>

A Day at the Beach is comprised of 90 cards, 84 of which make up the game (the rest are the rules.) Those familiar with Game Crafter cards should know what to expect quality-wise. They're not quite Poker/CCG quality, but they're far from cheap. My major complaint is that the cards either aren't cut properly, or the image wasn't setup properly on The Game Crafter's end. The card backs aren't centered properly, leaving them look like they're a bit cut off.

As for the rest of the artwork for the game, it's very simple, fitting the theme of the game and not much else.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

When A Day at the Beach first arrived I wasn't sure what to make of it. It looked to simple and bland to really capture my interest. I'm glad to say that actually playing to game proved to be quite entertaining. The use of variable sets, action cards, and the Ocean created a dynamic that proved to a lot fun than I was initial assumptions. While it's not anything groundbreaking, A Day at the Beach provides a simple-to-learn, portable, fun game that should do well with fans of mass-market card games.
