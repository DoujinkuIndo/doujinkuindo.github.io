I've been eagerly awaiting a copy of MoonQuake Escape since I first saw the game at PAX East last year. The combination of colorful art, awesome board mechanic, and bluffing had me instantly hooked. At PAX East this year designer Jeff Johnston was able to send me home with a copy, and I was super excited to break it out an put it all togehter.

Here's the pics!
