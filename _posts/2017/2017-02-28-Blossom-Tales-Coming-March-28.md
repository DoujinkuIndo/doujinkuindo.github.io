Hitting Steam on March 28th, Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King is a vast open game world in classic action-adventure fashion. Play as Lily, Knight of the Rose, in a fantastic top-down action-RPG in the same vein as A Link to the Past. Slash your way through monster-infested dungeons to save the Kingdom of Blossom from eternal darkness. The game is developed by Castle Pixel and published by FDG Entertainment.

Collect unique weapons, spells, and more during your journey to take down powerful bosses and solve clever puzzles. Enjoy a vivid, dynamic story passed down from grandfather to grandchildren by influencing the course of events yourself!

Castle Pixel describes Blossom Tales as "A delightful mix of 'Zelda' and 'Princess Bride'."

If all this sounds as awesome to you as it does to me, keep an eye on the game's [Steam page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/446810).
