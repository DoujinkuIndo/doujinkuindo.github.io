Recently Imp House, LLC launched Savage Planet on Kickstarer, a semi-cooperative tableau-building game with some *amazing* artwork. We're talking 80's fantasy style...my **favorite**. 

Savage Planet has each player taking control of a city-state in the world of game's world of Fantos. Over the course of the game they try to build up their Citadel and earn the favor of Zodraz, a Cosmic Warden. If you couldn't tell their be some lore to the game, that last sentance should give you a good hint. Every character in the game has some sort of history, coming from one of six races. There's a great [blog post](http://www.imphouse.com/savage-planet-design-log-welcome-to-fantos-2/) on Imp House's site detailing the world.

Anyway! The game looks pretty awesome, boasting multiple paths to victory, unique mechanics, and highly interactive rounds. If you're looking to actually take a peek you can download a [print-and-play](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ph4f4s9hdntzhy/SP_FOF_PNP.zip?dl=0) version of the game to give it a shot before you pledge.

Savage Planet is already funded and working through their stretch goals. A $30 pledge will get you the game and all the unlocked goals once the campaign ends. It's the only pledge level, so it's nice and easy.
