[Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles](https://www.yonderchronicles.com/), Prideful Sloth's first title, launches on the PS4 and on Steam July 18th. Yonder is an open-world adventure game where players can farm, craft, fish, and explore in 8 colorful and detailed biomes. Of course there's the whole dark threat hanging over the island of Gamea to worry about, too.

Yonder will have a price tag of $20, but there's discount out there for $16 if you preorder it on the [Playstation Store](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/yonder-the-cloud-catcher-chronicles/cid=UP1243-CUSA08242_00-YONDERCCUS000000). No word if the lower price will be available at all on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/580200/Yonder_The_Cloud_Catcher_Chronicles/).
