Back in 2015, I had the chance to take a look at Norsaga, a puzzle battle card game where players are Viking poets telling tales of their lineage heroic characters and plenty of embellishments. It's a fantastic game with brilliant art that can support up to 4 players in less than an hour.

Now Meromorph Games has launched a Kickstarter for a new Norsaga expansion called Odds and Endings. 3 new decks of cards add Immortals, Heirlooms, and Realms to the game. Each deck can be used individually, so you don't always need to play with all 3.

Heirlooms and Immortals are unlockable cards that give players a boost when used. At the start of the game, each player is dealt one card from the deck being used. Heirlooms are unlocked by sacrificing 3 heroes during play but restores your youngest hero's ability to inherit gives them a second color. This opens up a path to multiple embellishments from then on out. Immortals come in two forms, Guardians and Watchers. These are unlocked by having 3 heroes in your timeline matching the 3 colors on the Immortal card. Guardians can alter the stats of heroes on the board, while Watchers provide free embellishments for players every other turn.

Realms, like Heirlooms and Immortals, are limited to one per player. They can be chosen or dealt randomly, and change the rules of the game for the player that holds them.

Each of the new card types drastically changes gameplay and player strategy but does so without adding an excessive amount of complexity. They're subtle changes that are easy to integrate into the game without much of a second thought. They give players a bit more flexibility, but really don't change the nature of Norsaga at all.

If you're a Norsaga fan, as I am, I can't recommend backing this expansion enough. It's a minimum pledge of $8 to guarantee you a copy. Pocket change to make an already great game even better. Don't have Norsaga? Pledge $40 to get a copy of the base game, the Into the Myths expansion, promo cards, and, of course, the Odds and Endings expansion.

You won't be sorry you did.

*A prototype copy of Norsaga: Odds and Endings was provided free for preview by Meromorph Games.*
