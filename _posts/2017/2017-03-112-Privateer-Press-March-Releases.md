These products are top-notch. Cygar’s Brickhouse Heavy Warjack is a metal and resin model with an MSRP of $59.99. Included in the box is a unique character card denoting the units various stats and abilities. The level of detail on this model is outstanding. Due to Brickhouse’s Bond [Maddox] ability, the warjack makes a great follow-up purchase for any player who previously picked up the Cygnar Battlegroup Box (PIP 31121). Brickhouse also pairs well with hard-hitting warcasters such as Lord Commander Stryker (PIP 31034), Captain Jeremiah Kraye (PIP 31052), and Captain E. Dominic Darius (PIP 31031).

In contrast, Captain Allison Jakes is a smaller, all metal miniature. However, there is no lack of detail. Similarly, included in the packaging is her unique character cards containing stats, abilities, and spells and a 30 mm base. Her MSRP is $15.99. This is the full warcaster version of the character solo Lieutenant Allison Jakes. With plenty of abilities that increase the effectiveness of her warjacks, Captain Allison Jakes pairs very well with Cygnar’s heavy-hitting warjacks, such as the Centurion and Hammersmith, as well as with units like Cygnar’s Sword Knights, whose Flank [friendly Faction warjack] ability synergizes exceptionally well with both Positive Charge and Powerhouse.

I am most excited about the literature release for March. The Forces of Cygnar printed materials are outstanding. Included are beautiful, crisp photos of the Cygnar product line, specific character pages detailing abilities and rules, vivid illustrations, a painting guide, and AOE templates.
