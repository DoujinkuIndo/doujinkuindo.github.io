![Yu-Gi-Oh! May Releases](/images/yu-gi-oh/may2017.jpg){: .float-right}May is almost here, and that means another round of relases for the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. Next month will see two new releases: **Maximum Crisis** and **Duelist Pack: Dimensional Guardians**.


**Maximum Crisis**, a 100-card set, arrives May 5th in 9-card booster packs. The entire set contains 48 Commons, 20 Rares, 14 Super Rares, 10 Ultra Rares, and 8 Secret Rares and will retail for $3.99 per pack. This new set introduces three new themes and the final evolutions of Pendulum Summoning with Pendulum scales of 0-13. This finally opens up the ability to summon *any* level monster from any deck.

May 29th will see the release of the latest Duelist Pack, **Dimensional Guardians**. This is a 45-card set sold in 5-card boosters for $1.99 per pack. The set breaks down to 22 commons, 10 Rares, 6 Super Rares and 7 Ultra Rares. Here we'll see the return of Jack Atlas, Kite Tenjo, and Alexis Rhodes armed with cards from *Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Dâ€™s*, *Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL* and *Yu-Gi-Oh! GX*, as well as new cards from *Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V*. Performapals, Speedroids, Frightfurs and Raidraptors make up a bulk of the cards.

Sadly, no Dinomists.
