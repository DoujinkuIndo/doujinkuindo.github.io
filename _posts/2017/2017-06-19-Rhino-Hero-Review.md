<h2>Prelude</h2>

Super Rhino is a super, and very heavy, hero. As he patrols the city and keeps its citizens save he bounds from building to building, being very careful not to topple them! Rhino Hero is a dexterity game of stacking cards for kids ages 5+.

<h2>Play</h2>

As with most HABA games, Rhino Hero is incredibly easy to play. Basically, you want to get rid of your hand of 5 roof tiles. You do this by carefully building up a skyscraper, using special cards to foil other players, and being very careful not to topple the whole thing!

I could explain the game in more detail, but HABA has the perfect video that explains how to play.

<h2>Pieces</h2>
![Tower](/images/haba/tower.jpg){: .float-right}
HABA always uses the utmost care when designing their games. Rhino Hero follows suit with a familiar, sturdy yellow box, thick cards, and a wonderful wooden Super Rhino. The coolest bits in the box are the wall cards which can be folded in half so they can be stacked easily.

Rhino Hero should certainly stand up to family play.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

It's hard not to love Rhino Hero. With its loveable hero, simple mechanics, and engaging gameplay, it's quickly become a family favorite in our household. Our 3-year-old and 7-year-old love stacking the cards and watching the tower topple, whole our 10 and 11-year-old enjoy trying their hand at the harder difficulty, starting the tower with just one support.

We're big HABA fans in our house, and Rhino Hero has quickly shot up the ranks as one of the best HABA games we own. With a $13.99 price tag, there's no reason not to add Rhino Hero to your family's collection.
