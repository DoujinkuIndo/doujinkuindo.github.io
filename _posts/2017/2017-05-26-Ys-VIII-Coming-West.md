The first new Ys game in 8 years is finally on it's way to the US and Europe. Releasing on September 12, Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA will be available for the PS4 and Vita with both physical and digital versions. The game will also get a digital PC release on Steam (Windows only.)

Ys VIII will feature dual audio (English and Japanese) as well as in-game text in English and French.

It's been a *REALLY* long time since I've played a Ys game. Like, SNES era. I'm going to have to recify that.
