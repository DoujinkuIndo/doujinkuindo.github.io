Larian Studios had an impressive showing at PAX East with plenty of workstations loaded with an early access copy of Divinity: Original Sin 2. Set a thousand years after the first game, Divinity: Original Sin 2 features a darker and more grounded narrative than its award-winning predecessor, while building on its lauded combat systems. Just the first chapter of the new game contains more narrative text than the entire of its predecessor. Also, just about everything in the world can be interacted with, every NPC can be talked to, and there's different, branching options available for every character type. Each of your actions will have an impact on the game as a whole.

I got a chance to play a bit of the game and was impressed at what I saw so far.

Right now Act 1 of the game is available on [Steam Early Access Release](http://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/). That gets you around 8-12 hours of gameplay.
