[Wyrmwood Gaming](https://wyrmwoodgaming.com/) has made a name for themselves as one of the best creators of high-quality gaming accessories out there. Their excellent craftsmanship, selection of different woods, and selection of products set them apart from their competitors. It's no surprise that the [leather playmat](https://wyrmwoodgaming.com/products/wyrmwood-playmat/) they sent me to review was anything other than extraordinary.

The mat is stone-oiled Water Buffalo leather and comes standard with Wyrmwood's logo and name engraved on it. Want to change the text? No problem. An extra $50 and you can have whatever you want on it. The quality of the leather is clear as soon as you open the box. The first thing to hit you is that wonderful leather smells. Upon taking the mat out and unrolling it you can appreciate just how beautiful the playmat really is. It's thick, durable, and exactly what you'd expect from a high-quality leather.

Even though the mat comes rolled up, it's still a bit stiff when it arrives. It takes a bit of breaking in to soften it up and have it lay flat on the table. You can do this by rolling it up on opposite sides, or use the included leather conditioner to treat it and speed the process up a bit. I used the rolling method with mine for a few days and it really makes a fantastic difference. It's now softer and lays perfectly flat every time it's unrolled.

This is a playmat that's meant to last a lifetime, though it may require a bit of love and care for it to do so. Over time, like any leather product, the playmat will begin to show some wear. Now some people, myself included treasure this look. If you're not one of those people you can use leather conditioner to remove surface imperfections and keep the mat looking like it just came out of the box.

As far as gaming mats go, you can't get much better than this. It's a piece that will last the test of time with a style that will never go, well, out of style. At $50 it's a bit more than your average neoprene playmat, but it will certainly last much longer and is a much better investment.

A total win.
