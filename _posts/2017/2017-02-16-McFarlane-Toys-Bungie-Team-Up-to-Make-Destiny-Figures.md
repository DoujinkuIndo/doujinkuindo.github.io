McFarlane Toys is proud to announce that it is once again partnering with Bungie – this time to create Guardian action figures for Destiny, scheduled for release this summer.

McFarlane Toys’ initial set of Destiny toys will be fully articulated figures that depict  the Guardian Classes. Each will have a windowed collector box and will come with a Destiny branded base.

*“Detail, depth, and customization, that’s what Destiny gives its players, and that’s what made it the biggest new video game franchise launch,”* said Todd McFarlane, Owner and CEO of McFarlane Toys. *“With our upcoming Destiny line, fans can expect that same amount of detail and customization that we have built our own reputation on.”*

You can expect to see the Destiny figures on store shelves in July with a MSRP of $19.99.
