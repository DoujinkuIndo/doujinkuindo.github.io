You may remember quite some time ago I backed [Fallen Angel](http://pawnsperspective.com/Fallen-Angel-Kickstarter/) on Kickstarter. My copy arrived a few weeks ago and I had meant to posts some pictures, but there was a small problem. The box was pretty banged up. Thankfully all the components where safe but the box had seen better days. I was supposed to get a new box from the company and it hasn't arrived yet. Feeling pretty frustrated, I decided to just go ahead and post the pictures and try to keep most of the box damage as hidden as possible.
