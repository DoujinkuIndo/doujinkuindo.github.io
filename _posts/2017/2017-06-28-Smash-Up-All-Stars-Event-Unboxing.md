AEG recently released a kit for retailers to run a Smash Up event with some exclusive goodies. The kit contains 2 copies of the base game, a giant neoprene play mat, a bag with some tokens, and 8 packs of an all new All Star faction that contains some of the best cards from previously released factions.

All in all the kit can support up to 8 players and is might impressive for a total of $110. Events are pretty much the only place to snag the new faction booster, so find one near you!
