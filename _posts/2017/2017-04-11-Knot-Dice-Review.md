Last week, Black Oak Games sent over a deluxe set of Knot Dice for review. Knot Dice is the first game published by Black Oak Games. Originally funded by a Kickstarter campaign, the basic Knot Dice set retails for $29.95 and comes with 18 custom dice that form Celtic knot designs, with which you can play a large number of games and puzzles. However, I had the opportunity to check out a deluxe set, which retails for $57.95 and contains 36 dice and a cloth dice bag.

Unboxing the game reveals several game components: 36 dice, 8 wooden tokens, 1 cloth bag, 1 game book, and 1 puzzle book. Much of the game’s artistic flare is found in the dice themselves. The dice are beautifully crafted, emerald-colored cubes that are slightly larger than your standard playing die. Each die has a translucent shimmering quality, giving them a bit of depth. Silvery inset lines form Celtic knot designs across each surface of the dice. These knots are used to form patterns during gameplay.

We began by selecting a game from the book that could be played with two people called “Know so Fast.” The goal of the game is to collect the most dice by forming closed knots faster than your opponents. After a few rounds we began to get the hang of it. The game book is very straightforward and easy to read and comprehend. The rules are simplified and explained using a number of color diagrams. You can also find videos explaining 12 of the games’ rules on [Black Oak Games YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVcGGWlOhEQw_O9fSetm2nqlhFa9D4Kfb). Although, it felt repetitive at times, the game was fast-paced and short lived—a nice quality, which helped to keep our interest.

After playing another game titled “A Celtic Yarn,” where players compete to form a weaving knot pattern on a grid of dice, we moved on to some puzzles. The puzzle book was definitely my favorite of the two. Building the puzzles contained in the books felt fun and rewarding. If puzzle games are not for you, then this game is likely not your thing. However, Knot dice is certainly an easy-to-learn game that can be picked up by anyone at the table. It is a bit pricey, however, this versatile, hands-on game would undoubtedly be fun with some friends and a few rounds of drinks and would also make excellent mid-air entertainment. Whether or not you have Celtic roots, Knot Dice is a fun way to spend an hour or two.
