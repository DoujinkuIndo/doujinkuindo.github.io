There's been two new announcements coming from the Pokémon camp in the past few days.

The first is Pokémon Duel, a new mobile game for iOS and Android that brings the excitement of of a tabletop game to your phone or tablet. The goal of each match is to get your Pokémon to the other side of the board by moving, battling, and blocking using your collected Pokémon figures.

The game is free to play, but you can buy more character boosters and plates (cards) to boost your deck and smash your opponents. The Pokémon Company has made it very clear that the game can be won, and everything collected, without spending any money. In-game apps are just use to speed your way along.

I've given the game a go and so far I'm enjoying it. Unfortunately it doesn't feel like a game I'll stick to, and despite what The Pokémon Company says about not needing to spend money, I feel like I'll eventually hit a pay-wall.

The next announcement released was about the latest Pokémon Bank Update, now with Sun &amp; Moon compatibility. The new update lets you bring Pokémon from your previous games to the latest titles. New features also include:

* A Pokédex that allows players to see info about Pokémon registered and connected to Pokémon Bank in the National Pokédex.
* Adventure Records, which allows players to reflect on their past adventures by evaluating their saved data containing interesting figures and stats like the number of Pokémon caught or the number of wild Pokémon encountered.
* Transfer your Pokémon from the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console games Pokémon Red, Pokémon Blue, and Pokémon Yellow, and reveal previously hidden Pokémon stats like Abilities, Natures, Sp. Ark and Sp. Def, once imported to Sun & Moon!
* Receive Poké Miles for every Pokémon deposited into the Bank and the length of time they remain, which may be redeemed for Battle Points to be exchanged in Sun & Moon for various items.

To go along with the latest update, a new event has been announced! Players who access Pokémon Bank from January 25th to October 2nd, 2017, will receive a Mewnium Z, the Z-Crystal for the Mythical Pokémon Mew, that cannot be obtained in the normal game. Give the Mewnium Z to a Mew which has learned the move Psychic, and you'll unlock the powerful Z-Move Genesis Supernova!
