February is over. It's now time to check how well I'm doing in my [10x10 Board Game Challenge](http://pawnsperspective.com/10x10-Board-Game-Challenge/). I've played a lot of games this month...but not I've only gotten a few more plays in from my list.

**4 Plays** / **7 Plays Total in 2017**

4 times with *different people*. Not a shabby number!

**1 Play**

I was able to get a game of Hero Realms in with my oldest son one night when he requested we play it instead of a new game. Yay! 1 play!
