I fell in love with Antler Games' Salt Lands the first time I laid eyes on the box. It's strikingly minimal, with wonderful character art. Inside all the components follow suit with a heavy post-apocalyptic feel that still plays on muted colors and excellent graphic design.

I haven't had a chance to get it to the table yet, but it the game is half as good as how it looks I think this may become an easy favorite.
