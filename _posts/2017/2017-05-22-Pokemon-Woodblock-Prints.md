*Vermillion City from Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue is presented as a classic Japanese ukiyo-e landscape with a variety of Pokémon living and playing in it. Fans will find more than two dozen Pokémon pictured including Slowpoke, Pikachu, Meowth, Charizard, Lapras, and Gyarados. The Pokémon are all enjoying the waterfront port, as travelers in a landscape from Hiroshige Utagawa’s 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō.*

*Silence Bridge is a scene that depicts the exciting start of a battle, starring Pikachu, Red holding a Poké flute and an awoken Snorlax. Its composition and background are closely based on Yoshitoshi Tsukioka’s masterpiece Gojo Bridge, an Episode from the Life of Yoshitsune, an homage to the famous battle between two 12th century samurai, Ushikawa and Benkei.*
