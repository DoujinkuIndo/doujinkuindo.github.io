Recently, I have been playing some late-night sessions of Fantasy Flight’s A Game of Thrones Board Game with a group of friends. Given how competitive the game can be, the small, flimsy original paper player screens can be fairly frustrating. Not having enough room to organize your tokens, cards, and units makes secret strategizing and plotting your neighbor’s destruction all the more difficult. Thus, I was excited when I stumbled upon [Tower Rex](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TowerRex?ref=profile_shopname)’s custom laser-cut [game shields](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TowerRex?ref=profile_shopname).

These game shields are really cool. The whole set only costs $22—for real, that’s all. Included in the set are six unique game shields, one representing each house of the game: Storm’s End, Casterly Rock, Winterfell, Highgarden, Sunspear, and Pyke. Each game shield has its house keep laser-cut on its face. On the back is a ledge for your units, space for your decks, and slots to neatly organize your tokens. The sides of the game shields wrap around to block your opponent’s lines of sight. There is even enough space to insert the original paper screens in order to still have access to the game information contained on them.

The game shields are shipped disassembled and attached to a sprue. Assembly was very easy and did not require any tools or glue. The game shields shipped from Kiev, Ukraine, so they took some time to arrive. However, it was well worth the wait. Every now and then an accessory comes along that is worth getting excited about. This is one of those items. And, the entire set only costs $22! I can’t stress how impressed I was with these game shields!
