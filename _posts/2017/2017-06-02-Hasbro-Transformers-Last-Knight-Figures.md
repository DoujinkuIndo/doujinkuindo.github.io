Normally I had to do this, but there's just too much information here. Here's a dump of all the info and pictures from the latest Hasbro press release revealing the 'Transformers: The Last Knight' figures. There's actually quite a few here in here that aren't too bad. Much more than I'd expect from the movie-related line of toys.

Of course there's a lot in here that's just gone way, way wrong.

I may have to pick up Megatron and Nitro for sure.
