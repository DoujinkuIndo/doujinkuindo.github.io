Last week, I received a Limited Edition Silver Box copy of Mothership, the tabletop combat space strategy game.  Mothership is a simple game to learn, players take turns moving ships, attacking other players, capturing planets, and managing their economy.

The Mothership game box contains the game board (20” x 20”), 6 control panels, 6 tech trees, 42 miniature space ships and stands, 8 planets and stands, 92 action cards, 30 resource cards, 12 artifact cards, 6 victory point cards, 12 asteroid field tiles, a set of 5 dice, 42 capture markers, and a number of token counters. The quality of the game components is outstanding and all of the game materials have an intrinsic stylized look and feel. My biggest complaint is the overall size of the components. Small delicate miniatures crowd the game board creating a tedious hex grid that was constantly being jostled by elbows and rolling dice.

Gameplay was great. The goal is to survive, while also wiping out your opponents. The game is fast-paced (always a plus in my opinion). All players begin with the same core set of ships and must collect and spend resources on various techs and action cards in order to attempt to gain an advantage over their opponents. One thing that I found truly unique and clever is the use of a master control panel to govern your mothership’s stats. This allows you to decrease power allocated to your weapons, shields, or speed in order to increase the power of another. This makes the mothership a versatile fighter capable of dishing out heavy-hitting attacks, pulling off calculated escapes, and withstanding substantial damage.

Additionally, each player’s tech tree allows strategic customization and fleet specialization. The tech tree also aids in curbing run-on games by allowing players to increase their power exponentially.  

I would absolutely recommend this game to any avid tabletop gamer. The game is easy to learn, fun to play, and is truly unlike anything out there. With unique game mechanics to set this game apart, it had my attention from start to finish. I would recommend using a dice tray to avoid the frustration of constantly knocking over the pieces. I look forward to my next chance to pick up the dice and play this game again. If you haven’t checked this game out, it is worth your time.
