<iframe style="float:right;" src="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/31839895/gruff-rage-of-the-trolls/widget/card.html?v=2" width="220" height="420" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>Just launched on Kickstarter today. Gruff: Rage of the Trolls is the 3rd product in the Gruff line. The first two, [Gruff](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/31839895/gruff-the-tactical-card-game-of-mutated-monster-go?ref=user_menu) and [Clash of the Battle Goats](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/31839895/clash-of-the-battle-goats?ref=user_menu), both had successful Kickstarter campaigns in their own right.

For those unfamiliar with Gruff, it's a card battling game where players take control of a shepherd and mutated goats. It's a unique game where actions and attacks don't always take place as soon as you play them, most of the time resolving during your opponent's turn.

It's absolutely one of my favorite card battle games of all time.

Rage of the Trolls, like the two sets before it, is a standalone game that can be combined with the other sets for more flexibility and customizability. The difference here is that Rage of the Trolls adds co-op and solo gameplay options, having players face off against a Troll that follows a set of rules for automated turns.

While the new co-op mode is cool, it still takes a back seat in my mind to the classic Gruff gameplay. The new shepherds and goats are more exciting to me than the trolls, but the ability to play solo now means I can play one of my favorite cards games anytime I please, just as long as I have a deck and a troll set up.

Fans of Gruff should most certainly pick up Rage of the Trolls. New to the game? I'd still snag it but would recommend Clash of the Battle Goats as your introductory set into the world of hideously mutant goats and their insane handlers.

Gruff: Rage of the Trolls is almost fully funded, so make sure to [pledge at least $25](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/31839895/gruff-rage-of-the-trolls) to make sure get your copy.

*A prototype copy of Gruff: Rage of the Trolls was provided free for preview by Studio Woe.*
