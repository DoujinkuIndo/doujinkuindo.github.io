Daniel French of [Dan the Lefty](https://www.etsy.com/shop/DanTheLefty) sent over several examples of leather dice accessories for review. Based out of Atlanta, Georgia, Dan the Lefty specializes in made-to-order leather items, handmade with a careful attention to detail and quality.

The first items shown here are the [basic leather deck box](https://www.etsy.com/listing/188977315/leather-deck-box?ref=shop_home_active_5) ($20) and the [basic leather deck box with belt clip](https://www.etsy.com/listing/194033471/leather-deck-box-with-belt-clip?ref=shop_home_active_30) ($25). Measuring 3.75” x 2” x 3”, this leather deck box is designed to hold approximately 100 cards for Magic the Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh! These boxes are available in tan, light brown, dark brown, black, green, blue, or red leather. Additionally, Dan the Lefty accepts special custom orders and can create a unique-colored deck box or add custom tooling designs or engraving. These deck boxes contain a secure metal snap to prevent the top flat from opening and your cards spilling out. The quality of the leatherwork is excellent and the leather has a nice, glossy finished feel.

The next two items shown are a [basic leather dice cup](https://www.etsy.com/listing/189519971/leather-dice-cup?ref=shop_home_active_9) ($37) and a [leather dice cup with Celtic knot designs](https://www.etsy.com/listing/214538261/leather-dice-cup-with-celtic-knot?ref=shop_home_active_8) ($45). Each dice cup measures 4” tall x 3” diameter. These made-to-order leather dice cups are perfect for any dice game, such as Dungeons & Dragons or Imperial Assault. Additionally, each dice cup has a matching lid, so you can use it for storing your dice when you aren't playing. They are available in the same color options and can also be engraved or customized with tooling. I was especially impressed with the Celtic knot designs. The intricate level of detail really adds a nice stylized touch.

The down side is that these leather products are not cheap. So, if you are looking for a low-cost way to store your cards or house your dice, these items are likely not for you. However, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for some quality leather gaming accessories to spruce up your play area and fill the room with that wonderful leather smell, than check these items out.
