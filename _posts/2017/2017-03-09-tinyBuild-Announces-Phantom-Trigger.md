[Phantom Trigger](http://www.phantomtrigger.com/#portfolio-image/1/) is a Hardcore Neon Slasher with RPG and Roguelike elements. Figure out what's real as you follow the story of Stan on a journey through surreal and twisted worlds. There's not many more details just yet except some awesome screenshots on the web page. tinyBuild will be showing the game off at PAX East this weekend, so I'm really hoping to get some hands-on time with it.

I'm drooling over this one, folks. Drooling.
