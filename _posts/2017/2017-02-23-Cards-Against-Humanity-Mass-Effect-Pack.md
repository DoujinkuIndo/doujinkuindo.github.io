If you've read the title of this post, you understand what's going on here. Cards Against Humanity has teamed up with BioWare to create a small pack of 14 Mass Effect cards for everyone's favorite adult party game. You can snag the cards from [totallyfuckablealiens.com](https://totallyfuckablealiens.com/) for $1 (that includes shipping.)

It may feel like some cards are missing from this set. That's because they'll be sold later as DLC. Way to follow through on a theme CAH.
