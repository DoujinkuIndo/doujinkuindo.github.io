For those of us that don’t want to shell out the big bucks for a 3D printer, there are some quality “go-between” printing operations out there. One of those is [3D Printworks](https://www.etsy.com/shop/3dPrintworksShop#about). Owned by [Barbara Thorndyke](https://www.etsy.com/people/barbarathorndyke1) and based out of Springfield, Missouri, 3D Printworks offers a number of gaming items. Thorndyke’s operation is characterized by an approachable small-town flavor with a specialty in attention to detail. This small, two-printer operation works with freelance designers or pulls designs from Thingiverse. This means that 3D Printworks offers a collection of both unique and common market items.

3D Printwork was kind enough to share two examples of their work with me: a [Travel-Size Dice Tower](https://www.etsy.com/listing/476787874/3d-printed-dice-tower-easy-travel-size?ref=shop_home_active_11) and a [Magnetic Dice Vault](https://www.etsy.com/listing/491595089/3d-printed-magnetic-dice-vault-more?ref=shop_home_active_7).

The compact dice tower can handle 12mm and 16mm dice with ease. Standard D20’s and your typical RPG set of seven dice will also roll through nicely. The bottom tray traps the dice well, so they don’t go tumbling away off the table after they pass the tower’s two slanted ledges. The dice tower is printed from PLA (polylactic acid), a biodegradable plastic made from plant starches. Its dimensions are:

Height: 105.4mm, 4.15 inches
Width: 48.2mm, 1.9 inches
Funnel Width: 63.3mm, 2.49 inches

You can find the source file for this dice tower [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1358428).

The dice vault uses Neodymium magnets to hold itself shut, keeping your dice secure during your travels. It can hold a standard set of seven dice, plus an additional extra. Its dimensions are:

Height - 0.95 inches, 24.2mm
Width - 1.31 inches, 33.3mm
Length - 5.94 inches, 150.8mm

Both prints sell for $20 each and have sixteen different color options to choose from. Orders typically take 1-2 business days, making this a relatively speedy print operation. If you are looking for low-cost, quick prints, 3D Printworks is a great source.
