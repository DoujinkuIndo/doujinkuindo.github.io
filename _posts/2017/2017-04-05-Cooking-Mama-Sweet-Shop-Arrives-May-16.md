The latest installment of the Cooking Mama series, Sweet Shop, arrives on the 3DS in retail packaging on May 16 in North America. The digital release comes a few days later on May 28. There's over 60 different recipies to create over the course of 160 mini-games. Like other games in the series players use the stylus to slice, stir, bake, and decorate their creations. The microphone is used so you can blow and cool your treats! Shop upgrades are earned the more sweets you create and the happier customers are.

Cooking Mama: Sweet Shop also features a competitive multiplayer mode for two to four players – challenge your friends and see who can make the tastiest treats. And just like always, don’t worry if you make a mistake - Mama will fix it for you!

No word on final price just yet.
