Konami's Yu-Gi-Oh! special holiday release this year, *Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Legendary Dragon Decks*, arrives on October 6th. The set will contain 153 cards, including:

* Two 40-card Decks with 11-card Extra Decks
* One 41-card Deck with a 10-card Extra Deck
* 5 foil cards in each deck

The three decks, **Legendary Dragons of Atlantis**, **Cyber Dragons**, and **Dimensional Dragons**, are ready to play out of the box. Of course you can mix and match the cards to create your own creations.

Here's Konami's descriptions of each deck:

**Legendary Dragons of Atlantis!**

*The powers of the Legendary Dragons of Atlantis – Timaeus, Critias, and Hermos – were sealed into Spell Cards, used by Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey to fight against Dartz and The Seal of Orichalcos! The Eye of Timaeus, The Fang of Critias, and The Claw of Hermos are well-loved by Duelists everywhere for their ability to Fusion Summon a wide variety of unique monsters using only one material! All 3 Spells and all of their Fusions are included in this Deck inspired by Yugi’s final Duel against Dartz, as is a brand-new Fusion Monster born of The Eye of Timaeus and Yugi’s famed Dark Magician!*

**Cyber Dragons!**

*Many Duelists consider Cyber Dragon to be the most influential monster ever created, so it’s only natural that it’s earned the title of “legendary!” Cyber Dragon originally debuted in 2005’s Cybernetic Revolution along with 2 Fusion Monster forms Summoned by combining multiple Cyber Dragons together. Eleven years later in Breakers of Shadow, Cyber Dragon Infinity shocked the Dueling world with its incredible power and became a household name. This Deck is packed with the best that Cyber Dragon and its many Fusion and Xyz Monster forms have to offer along with a brand-new Fusion Monster!*

**Dimensional Dragons!**

*Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V’s Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon sparked a series of Dragons that covered the entire spectrum of Extra Deck monster types, and threw in a Ritual Monster for good measure. Adaptability is the defining feature of the “Odd-Eyes” strategy, starting from Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon’s dual nature as a way to search other Pendulum Monsters from your Deck and a way to end Duels in a flash with its double-damage ability. This Deck fills the final gap in the “Odd-Eyes” arsenal with a brand new “Odd-Eyes” Pendulum Monster!*
