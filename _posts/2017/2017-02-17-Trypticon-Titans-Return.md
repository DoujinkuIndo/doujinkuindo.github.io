In 2015 Hasbro gave fans the option to vote for their favorite character to become the next Generations Titans Return Titan Class toy. The ballots were counted and fans voted on Trypticon! Now, coming in the fall, Trypticon is the largest figure in the 2017 Titans Return universe and is also the biggest Decepticon figure ever made. It converts between three different modes: dino, spaceship and city.

When the figure is in city mode, it connects to Titans Return Leader Class figures to form the giant Nemesis Command. When the figure is in T-Rex mode, it can “eat” Titan Master figures: he can chomp them down, then you can open his stomach to get them out.

Trypticon comes with a Deluxe Class Full-Tilt figure and a Titan Master Decepticon Necro figure. The Full-Tilt figure attaches to the Trypticon figure's chest. The Titan Master figure becomes the head for the Full-Tilt figure and works with all Titans Return Deluxe, Voyager, and Leader Class figures.

Visitors to NY Toy Fair this coming weekend will be able to get the first up close and personal look at the new figure.

Trypticon will be available this fall for $149.99.
