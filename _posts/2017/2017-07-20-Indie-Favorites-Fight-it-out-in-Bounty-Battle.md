Expect to see favorites from games like Darkest Dungeon, Awesomenauts, Guacamelee, Flinthook, and much more!

Bounty Battle isn't just a straight forward fighting game, though. Players must manage resources, such as their life and energy, to earn Bounty Points. These can be used to create new actions and also hire minions.

So far the game looks amazing. It's currently in an alpha phase, fully feature-complete, but still needing bug fixes. The fig campaign has a little over 30 days left with 29% of the $30,000 goal met. Dark Screem's goal is to get the game on as many platforms as possible with a Q4 2018 release date.
