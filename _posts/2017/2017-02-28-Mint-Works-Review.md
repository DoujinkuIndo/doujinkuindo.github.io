<h2>Prelude</h2>

Back in August, I had posted about the [Mint Works Kickstarter](http://pawnsperspective.com/Mint-Works-Kickstarter/). For just $10 I secured myself a copy of the game once it was released. Well, that time has come and gone and I recently received my copy of the game. Considering it's such a short game, it didn't take it long to hit the table since we could easily squeeze it in even one of our busiest nights.

For the unfamiliar, Mint works is a pocket-sized, light worker placement game for 1-4 players that fits in a mint tin. It plays ultra quick and is a lot of fun.

<h2>Play</h2>

Mint Works plays very fast and is simple to grasp once you get past the rather vague rulebook (more on this later). Each player as a limited amount of Mint Tokens to use to earn more tokens, buy plans, build plans, or take the First Player token. Building plans is how you earn points in the game, and once a player has earned 7 points the end of the game is triggered and the round continues. At the end of the last round, the player with the most points wins.

Easy, right?

Of course, if that were all it wouldn't be very exciting, would it? As with any worker placement game, your actions are going to me limited by your current resources and the point in the round you take your action. Also, plans you build might have a power you can use to further help you along your merry way.

I should also mention that there's a solo variant with four different AI opponents to play against. Rules are similar, with each AI have preprogrammed behavior.

<h2>Pieces</h2>

One of the coolest things about Mint Works is it really does come in a mint tin! Inside is the rulebook, cards, and wooden mint tokens. Everything is high quality, but it took a bit of working to get everything *out* of the tin the first time I opened the game. I ended up needing to clip the corners of the rulebook a bit for a better fit. I had no issues with the cards or tokens, and everything packs back up nicely now.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

Mint Works is an excellent little game, and for the price, you really can't go wrong. Even though it's fast and easy to learn, it's a bit more than a filler game as there are enough choices and optional cards to really step the game up to a higher level. So far I've only played with my 11-year-old son, but I'm planning to get some games in with my 6 year old and 9 year old soon.

I do have *one* complaint. The rules are bit vague and I wasn't able to fully figure out how to properly play the game with them alone. I ended up having to watch Rahdo's walkthrough video (below), which laid everything out and made things *so* much more clear. After that, I was able to use the rules as a good reference and was off to the races.

While the final game is $12 (not the $10 it was through KS) it's still a great value in an amazingly small package. I now keep Mint Works in my bag so I can take it with me wherever I go. The metal tin keeps it safe and contains a whole lot of fun.

I can highly recommend the game, and am really glad I backed it on Kickstarter.
