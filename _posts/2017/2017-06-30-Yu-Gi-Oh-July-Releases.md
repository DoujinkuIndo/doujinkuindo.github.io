![Yu-Gi-Oh! Battles of Legend](/images/yu-gi-oh/battlesoflegend.png){: .float-right}July is pretty much here, so here's the latest Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG releases. July will see two releases: **Battles of Legend –Light’s Revenge–** and **Starter Deck –Link Strike–**. Both will be released on July 21st.

**Light’s Revenge** is an 80 all-foil card set, 60 Ultra Rares and 20 Secret Rares, sold in 5-card booster packs. **Link Strike** is a new starter deck that introduces Link Monsters, and features 43 cards, 38 Commons, 2 Ultra Rares, 3 Super Rares. You can find more info on the deck from my [previous post](http://pawnsperspective.com/Yu-Gi-Oh-Link-Strike-Release/) back in April.

Even though it's a ways off Konami has shared a sneak peek of **Circuit Break**, a set being released on October 20th that will contain 100 cards, including 48 Commons, 20 Rares, 14 Super Rares, 10 Ultra Rares and 8 Secret Rares. Cards like *Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys* will return in powerful phantasmal forms. **Circuit Break** introduces an infected strain of insectoid Mekkstrosities that emulate the human nervous system. They cluster rapidly, attempting to take the form of neurons, and if they succeed, all enemy monsters freeze up and become unable to defend their controller.

*I normally have a bit more information, and images, to post with these releases, but it seems Konomi is using a new PR company that doesn't provide as much detail as their last one. Hopefully this changes in the future and I can provide more details, earlier.*
