Readers of both this site and Purple Pawn probably know that my family is a huge fan of Peaceable Kingdom games, so when they approached me asking if I wanted to review their new title from Matt Leacock, Mole Rats in Space, I couldn't have give them a more enthusiastic "Yes." The game arrived late last week and we've already played it a handful of times. I figured I should get some pics of the game while it's relatively pristine. My 3-year-old son has a habit of being rough on cards.
