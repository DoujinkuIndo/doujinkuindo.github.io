*Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah-nagl fhtagn.*

[Rose Gaming Accessories](https://www.etsy.com/shop/RosesGamingAcc?ref=condensed_trust_header_title_items) is a custom woodwork gaming accessory crafter based out of London. They specialize in creating luxury handmade items to enhance your game table. Recently, they sent over several dice trays for us to check out. 

Each item pictured here is hand painted, sanded, and finished in beeswax, making each individual dice tray unique. The trays are fashioned from a selection of fine wood and lined with a felt interior. Additionally, each tray has brass corners and bun feet to protect your table. These trays measure 23cm x 14cm x 4cm and sell for approximately $35 each.

Pictured here is a [solid cherry wood tray](https://www.etsy.com/listing/514123481/solid-cherry-wood-d20-design?ref=shop_home_active_15) with a D20 tooled designed, a [solid black walnut tray](https://www.etsy.com/listing/521056235/solid-black-walnut-swords-and-flintlocks?ref=shop_home_active_4) with a sword and flintlock tooled design, and a [solid oak tray](https://www.etsy.com/listing/494743976/solid-oak-dice-tray-cthulhu?ref=shop_home_active_6) with Cthulhuâ€™s chant tooled design. These trays are smooth to the touch and look great. Additionally, the tray makes a gentle, pleasant sound as dice tumble across its felt surface.

I highly recommend these trays. They are low-cost, high-quality, and look great. Additionally, Rose Gaming Accessories crafts dice boxes, game chests, and even does custom orders. If you are in the market, they are worth a look.
