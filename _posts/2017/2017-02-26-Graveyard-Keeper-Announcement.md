Lazy Bear Games, of Punch Club fame, and tinyBuild have just announced Graveyard Keeper, the most inaccurate medieval cemetery management sim of the year. The game has you managing a medieval cemetery while cutting as many corners as you can to save time and money. It also lets you expand your business past corpse disposal into other areas like entertainment.

Beef cost too much for your excellent fair burgers? Look at all that "fresh" meat you have laying around the cemetary! There'll also be a crafting system, dungeons to explore, and dead bodies to exploit for their parts and blood!

Graveyard Keeper drops this year for PC and Xbox One. It'll be on the PAX East floor, too, so I'm hoping to get a good look at it while I'm there.
