Based out of Sherman Oaks, California. [Merchant Green Leather Works](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MerchantGreenLeather) crafts a number of quality leather gaming accessories. In addition to their online shop items, they also take custom requests for gaming or cosplay items. Shown here is a collapsible, [Rollable Dice Tray](https://www.etsy.com/listing/455710674/collapsible-rollable-dice-tray-in-two?ref=shop_home_active_1). This tray comes in two sizes, 4” x 7” ($25) and 7” x 9” ($35), and is offered in a wide variety of color and pattern options. The tray shown here is a 7” x 9” Cherry Wood color tray with Bricks inlay design and gold snaps.

The tray can be unsnapped to lie flat or be rolled for easy transport. With all four corners snapped, a dice tray is formed.

This is truly a fine, real leather dice tray. It even smells incredible. However, with fine leather comes the need for care. This tray should not be exposed to liquid, extreme heat, or direct sunlight—otherwise, it may discolor or shrink. A light leather conditioner may be used for cleaning. If quality and artistry interest you, then Merchant Green Leather Works is worth a browse.
