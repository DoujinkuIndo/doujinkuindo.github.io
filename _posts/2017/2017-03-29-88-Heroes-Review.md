<h2>Prelude</h2>

OK. I normally don't do this, but it's just too perfect of an introduction to a game to not. From 88 Heroes store page:

"It's 8:08am on 8th August 1988, and the evil Dr. H8 has brought the world to the brink of total annihilation! His demands are simple: pay $88 octillion within 88 minutes, or Dr. H8's 88 thermo-nuclear warheads will wipe out the Earth! But who will save us in our time of need? The bravest? The boldest? No... the 88 Heroes!"

<h2>Play</h2>

88 Heroes is a puzzle platformer where you need to navigate your hero through Dr. H8's tower floor-by-floor. Each floor as an elevator you need to reach and plenty of challenges and obstacles to keep you from getting there. You've also only have 88 seconds to beat each level, and 88 minutes to beat the game. You've also only got 88 lives in the form of 88 different heroes. If they all die it's game over, man. Game over.

Now, you may think 88 heroes is *way* more than you'd need to beat the game. The problem is that each and every hero is pretty useless. Some have crazy powers. Some have pointless powers. Some have no powers at all. Even worse, some have powers that will pretty much kill the hero as soon as they're used.

Don't be discouraged, though! Earn enough coins and you can resurrect dead heroes! Hopefully, ones that are more useful than most.

<h2>Pixels</h2>

88 Heroes certainly has it's own quirky pixel art. It's all very goofy, over the top with the 88s, and has a soundtrack that's good, but not ultra memorable. One of the coolest things about how the game presents itself is the perspective from which you play.

*An interesting perspective*{: .center}

During the game, you're playing the game over the shoulder of Dr. H8 as he watches the heroes make their way through his tower. He'll provide commentary when you die/complete a level and you'll also see his minions scuttling about as you try and concentrate on the level you're trying to complete. It's pretty unique, and just another wonderful bit of quirkiness 88 Heroes provides.

<h2>Perspective</h2>

I'm not going to lie, I laugh my ass off while playing 88 Heroes. It's over the top in almost every way and the heroes are so ridiculous it's hard not to laugh, win or die. The game is challenging, but not so hard that you're going to throw your controller in frustration.

I've already mentioned the excellent pixel art. I've also mentioned the mostly forgettable soundtrack. What I haven't yet mentioned is the excellent voice work and sound effects in the game. I also haven't said much about the controls, which range from excellent to almost impossible depending on the hero you're playing as. It's a crap shoot, though I have so much fun playing the game that the truly terrible heroes are just a blip on my radar.

For $15 you can't go wrong with 88 Heroes. It's a solid platformer with an excellent gimmick. I only wish I had the [physical release](http://pawnsperspective.com/88-Heroes-Gets-Physical-Release/) for the PS4 that gives you two additional heroes to play with.
