[Raw Fury](http://rawfury.com) had a lot going on in their booth during PAX East. Sadly I didn't have much time to look around and see everything that was going on there. I did, however, follow up with them after the show to see what was going on and what they had to offer. While they have a bunch of awesome looking new games, the one that really caught my eye was [Kingdom: New Lands](http://www.kingdomthegame.com) from Noio and Licorice.

It's no surprise that I love pixel art. I think I've made it pretty clear here that anything with beautiful pixels is immediately on my radar. Kingdom: New Lands is no exception. New Lands is actually a follow up to Kingdom that adds a slew of new content for players to discover. The game is sort of an *extremely* minimal city management game. The game doesn't hold your hand in any way, shape, or form and players need to learn by experience what to do, and how to make your city prosper.

I've barely scratched the surface of what content New Lands has to offer. So far I'm managed to build a small city that can somewhat defend itself against these creepy things that come at night and try to steal my gold and crown. I'm guessing things get much tougher as you go on.

Kingdom: New Lands is available on just about every platform except my toaster. Here's the complete list:
