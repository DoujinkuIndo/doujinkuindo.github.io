![Beyblade Burst Epic Rivals Battle Set](/images/beybladeburst/rivals.jpg){: .float-right}I've run a lot of Beyblade tournaments over the years, but those were all for the [World Beyblade Organization](http://worldbeyblade.org), who have a more rigid and standard set of rules for different types of tournaments. This is the first time in a long time that Hasbro has released resources for people to run their own tournaments at home, school, etc... Not only that, but official Hasbro tournmanets have been popping up in places, too.

It's great to see Beyblade getting some love from Hasbro again. They recently sent me a bunch of Burst product to play with, along with some posters and printed tournament materials. My kids and I have been having a blast with the new Beys and they seem to have sparked my kids' interested in the product again. While my local stores aren't up to date with all the latest Beyblade Burst product releases, they're easy enough to find online.

Interested in getting your own tournment going? Check out Hasbro's [resources][https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/brands/beyblade/printables] here to get started! Need some Beys to get started? Check out the [Beyblade Burst Epic Rivals Battle Set](http://amzn.to/2qolJnq). It comes with 2 Beys, 2 launchers, and a stadium.
