When I think of HABA I think of yellow-boxed, family friendly games. Games that are easy to learn, play in minutes, and that tend to cater to a younger audience.  Meduris turned that idea on its head. Here's a more traditional Euro-style game for an older audience that takes over an hour to play.

I'm excited!

Meduris contains a bunch of wooden goodies, some 3D cardboard pieces, and an absolutely beautiful board.
