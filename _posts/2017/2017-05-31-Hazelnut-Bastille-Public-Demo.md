Aloft Studio has just announced the release of the public demo for their game, Hazelnut Bastille. Access to the demo can be obtained by [signing up for their newsletter](https://www.aloftstudio.com/).

I happened to come across Hazelnut Bastille when someone retweeted the release of Aloft's demo yesterday. I was instantly intersted after seeing the retro SNES-inspired graphics and immediately set out to find out more about the game. It's a topdown adventure game similar to A Link to the Past, but has Metroidvania elements to its level design.

Aloft boasts an impressive list of features:

* Heavily conscientious level design
* Metroidvania progression
* Classic open-world Overworld and Dungeon format
* 16-bit graphic and audio style
* 8-voice Chiptune and lofi sample soundtrack
* Classic 4-way character navigation
* Enemy design invoking original Legend of Zelda principles
* Intense, brutal bosses which require learning and observation
* Highly challenging combat sequences with a high skill ceiling
* Puzzles built around observation, item use, and sequential logic
* Complex trading system to obtain optional items
* Customizable playstyle based on which items player obtains and equips 

Pretty much every one of those bullet points resonates with me. I'm currently downloading the demo build as I write this.

Hazelnut Bastille is set to release early-2018 for PC / Mac / Linux.
