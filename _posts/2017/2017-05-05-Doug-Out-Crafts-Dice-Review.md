Shown here are three examples of his artistic work on a 20-sided die. The designs pictured here are: [Graffiti](https://www.etsy.com/listing/384951290/graffiti-unique-laser-etched-d20?ref=related-1), [Ouija Planchette](https://www.etsy.com/listing/462025122/ouija-planchette-unique-d20-for?ref=related-1) (September 2016), and [Fortune Teller](https://www.etsy.com/listing/482843219/unique-d20-fortune-teller-20-sided-die?ref=related-3) (October 2016). These dice cost $15 a pop. However, this acrylic-painted unique item is worth the price to most gamers. The dice are an example of excellent craftwork. They roll smoothly and evenly and the numbers are easily read. Additionally, they are attention-grabbing and would make a nice addition to any stylized game. If you are looking for something a bit more distinctive, be sure to check them out.
