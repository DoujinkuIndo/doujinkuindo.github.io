Chemistry Fluxx is one of the latest themed Fluxx games from Looney Labs featuring, you guessed it, elements from the Periodic Table and chemistry equipment. There's also a few themed Actions and Rules tossed into the [card set](http://www.looneylabs.com/lists/chemistry-fluxx-card-list) as well as new Goals to go along with the new Keepers.

How does it compare to other versions of Fluxx?

It's Fluxx!

That's right. The game is exactly the same as just about every other version of Fluxx out there. The difference? Science! Chemistry Fluxx is one of the best Fluxx sets I've seen in a while, mostly because I'm just a huge fan of the theme. While I enjoy Cartoon Network Fluxx, Zombie Fluxx, and even regular old' Fluxx, there's just something about Chemistry Fluxx that feels *right*. There's less of the quirky humor that Fluxx is known for and a bit more of a sophisticated air to this version. All of the goals are simplified combinations of what they actually are.

Here's some examples:

**Laughing Gas:** Nitrogen + Oxygen\\
**Diatomic Molocules:** Hydrogen + Hydrogen or Oxygen + Oxygen\\
**Statue of Liberty Green:** Copper + Oxygen + Carbon

Chemistry Fluxx is a version of Fluxx that just feels...*smart*.

Again, I'm a big fan of Fluxx and how silly it can be. In the end, though, Chemistry Fluxx is the version of Fluxx I think is going to hit the table a lot more than the other copies I own.
