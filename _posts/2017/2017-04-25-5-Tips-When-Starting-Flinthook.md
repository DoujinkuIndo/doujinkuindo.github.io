![Bazaar](/images/flinthook/cover.jpg){: .float-right}Tribute Games recently released Flinthook, an action platformer and roguelike pirate game that has you zipping around levels with an anchor-like grappling hook while hunting bounties. Tribute shot me off a PS4 key for the game and I've been having a hell of a good time with the game. After a few hours of playing, I've come up with 5 tips for those of you playing for the first time.

<h3>5. Die</h3>

That's right. Die.

After you go through the tutorial level you'll be tossed straight into the game. Make your way through a ship and then die. This will use your available experience to go up in rank, get you a booster pack or two of Perk cards, and unlock the Black Market (among a few other things.)

The Black Market is where you'll spend the green gems you earn during play to purchase items that help you earn more experience, get more perk slots, etc... You also get a free set of boots when it's first unlocked.

There's no reason to go through any of the game without the free item and access to the market. The sooner you die, the sooner you get the Black Market.

<h3>4. Check the icons</h3>

Every ship you board has certain attributes, be it extra loot, a library, platoons of enemies, mazes, and more. Keep a close eye on the choices of ships to board to make sure you know what you're getting into. If you're just starting out, or low on HP, avoid platoons, traps, mazes, and anything else that looks or sounds dangerous.

<h3>3. Shake up your perks</h3>

It's easy to get comfortable with a set of perks, but you'll be doing yourself a disservice by not shaking it up once and a while. Always change your loadout to see how much easier/harder it makes the game. You may find a different set of perks suits your needs better than you'd think.

For me? Getting an apple every time I start a new ship didn't seem like a big deal. It ended up *really* helping me out. The extra HP boost helped me survive a couple more hits that would have had me starting my bounty all over again.

<h3>3. Slow down</h3>

Your Chronobelt is an amazing tool that slows down time and allows you to move through certain obstacles as you make your way through ships. Its usefulness doesn't stop there, though. Use the Chronobelt when there's a lot of enemies on the screen to help navigate your way safely through the masses. Slow down time to help avoid various projectiles that tricky sub bosses toss at you, or to better learn the patterns of traps.

<h3>1. Take your time</h3>

It's really tempted to zip around each room with your Quickhook as fast as you possibly can. It's immensely satisfying. Until you're a master of the hook, take your time! You'll end up flying into more enemies, spikes, and lasers than you'll care to admit.

With HP at a premium, taking your time and keeping your eyes open will keep you alive much longer and not have you scrambling to find apples or wasting your hard-earned gold on other HP-restoring items.
