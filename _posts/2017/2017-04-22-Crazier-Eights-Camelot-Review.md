Crazier Eights: Camelot is a fast-paced revamp of Crazy Eights, the card game classic. Let’s start with what’s inside the box. The box contains 52 playing cards and a set of rules. Additionally, there is a quick-guide rules card.

The goal of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. The game progresses in much of the same way as the classic Crazy Eights. Each player begins the game with a hand of seven cards. During a players turn, she draws one card from the deck, attempts to discard a card from her hand (by matching rank or color), and may play one card from her hand.

Each card contains either details of an “event” or an “asset.” Events are one-time use cards with impactful, but temporary, effects. An example might be forcing a player of your choice to skip a turn or allowing the player to discard an additional card. Alternatively, assets are permanent cards that are played on the table in front of the player to affect various game mechanics. For example, as asset may allow a player to discard one additional card per turn or allow the player to prevent a card from being destroyed.

Our first game was characterized by hesitation. However, the game still progressed in a timely manner. Our second game was much more speedy. The fast-paced design of the game is somewhat refreshing. Nothing is more frustrating than a game that drags on and on into monotony and boredom. A swift game allows from several rounds to be played in one sitting and prevents the game from turning stale too quickly. Additionally, the basic gameplay rules all fit on a single sheet. The rules are straightforward and easy to comprehend, making this a great game for a wide-range of ages. It did not take more than 10 minutes before we were drawing cards and getting started.

Despite a few inconspicuous typos on the game box and card text, the game has a very professional and aesthetic appearance. The card art is colorful, thematic, and appealing. Many card games seem repetitive and one-dimensional. This is not one of them. Crazier Eights: Camelot has replayabilty and I could see this game leaving the shelf often.
