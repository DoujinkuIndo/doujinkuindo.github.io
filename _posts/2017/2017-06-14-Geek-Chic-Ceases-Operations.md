[Geek Chic](https://www.geekchichq.com/), the manufacturer of some of the best board game tables out there, announced today that they are ceasing all operations. They posted this image on their Facebook page a little bit ago:

There have been no details given at this point, but rumor is this may have to do with their acquisition of Crash Games and some undocumented debt that went along with that deal. There have been a few wilder rumors dealing with that that I won't report here since I can't seem to get any solid facts.

There's also been no word on the what's going to happen with any orders already in process, deposits made, etc...

It's a shame to see them close their doors. They were an awesome company with some great people working for them. Geek Chic tables are still some of the most amazing board game tables out there, with a craftsmanship meant to last a lifetime.
