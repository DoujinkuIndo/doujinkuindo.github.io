[PAX East](http://east.paxsite.com/) starts today!

Unfortunately it didn't work out for me to attend today, but I'll be there tomorrow hitting up all sorts of cool digital and tabletop gaming goodness. I probably won't be posting anything until I get back, but you can always check my [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/pawnsperspective/) for anything cool I see at the show.

I've lined up a few great appointments, mostly with smaller video game booths, and then will be bumming around the tabletop area seeing what's new, meeting con-friends, and trying to play a few pick-up games.

Feel free to give a shout if you see me! I always love meeting new people. We may even have time to sit down to a game together!

If PAX East turns out like it usually does, I'll have a *ton* of stuff to play and post about in the coming weeks. Keep your eyes peeled!
