If you follow any boardgame circles online you've probably heard a lot of Monopoly Gamer in the past few days. A lot of gamers are going nuts for the game, even when most have a strong aversion to Monopoly in general.

Hasbro and Nintendo have teamed up for this powered-up version of Monopoly to create a game that plays a bit like Monopoly but contains some thematic and mechanical flair from the world of Super Mario. Coins replace standard Monopoly currency, characters have special powers, there are boss fights, and a lot more. There are even Power Packs you can buy to add new characters from the Super Mario universe to the game, each with their own unique powers. All the fan favorites are here: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Toad, Rosalina, Diddy Kong, Wario, and more.

Currently, you can only snag Monopoly Gamer at Gamestop locations. The game will see greater distribution in the Fall. The base set costs $24.99, while the Power Packs are available for $2.99.
