Piggybacking off [my recent post](http://pawnsperspective.com/InspiredCraftwork-Imperial-Assault-Tokens-Storage-Review/) highlighting custom tokens for Star Wars: Imperial Assault, I thought another post was appropriate. Last week, I got my hands on a set of custom 3D-printed tokens made by [Loaded Dice Designs](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LoadedDiceDesigns?ref=l2-shopheader-name). Based in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, Loaded Dice Designs prints a number of game components and token organizers for various tabletop games.

You can pick these bad boys up on [Etsy.com](https://www.etsy.com/listing/269827965/star-wars-imperial-assault-custom-door?ref=shop_home_feat_1) or [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CX4WVYS/ref=s9_acsd_hps_bw_c_x_1_w) for about $30. The set includes: four door tokens, eight terminal tokens, and eight loot crates. These tokens are high-quality prints. What really impressed me is the way they use the base set terminal and door tokens to fuse with the original components making these prints blend right in with the Fantasy Flight materials. These tokens look great without any painting or special attention. Recently, I have been on the hunt for ways to spruce up the Imperial Assault game board. This is certainly one of my favorite custom-printed sets on the market. It is a little pricier than some of the other sets out there, but it is well worth the extra coin.
