![Link Strike Deck](/images/yu-gi-oh/YS16_Tuck_Mock-EN.gif){: .float-right}New on the horizon for the Yu-Gi-Oh! CCG is **Starter Deck: Link Strike** featuring new Link Monsters that give you control over where you can play your cards.

Link Monsters start the game in your Extra Deck and you Link Summon them by sending face-up monsters you control to the Graveyard. Every Link Monster will tell you exactly what kind of monsters you need to sacrifice and how many to. Link Monsters don’t have a Level or Rank, or even a DEF stat. They can never be face-down or in Defense Position. They’re always face-up and in Attack Position so you always know where their arrows point. Arrows on the Link Monster are important because they point out the Monster Zones on the field they are link to. Depending on their effects, a Link Monster could gain ATK for every monster in a zone it points to, or protect any monster in a zone it points to from being destroyed.

With Link Monsters you can also control different monsters summoned from your Extra Deck. Adjacent Monster Zones a Link Monster's arrows point to are available to summon new monsters. The trick is to get as many arrows pointing at your own zones as you can while avoiding pointing to your opponent's zones. This adds a new level of strategy to Yu-Gi-Oh!

**Starter Deck: Link Strike** comes with 3 new, all-foil Link Monsters to add to your Extra Deck, plus a full Main Deck and a new Game Mat showing the new Extra Monster Zones. This set also introduces a brand-new Type of monster to join Dragons, Warriors, Spellcasters, and all the rest. Inspired by networking machinery, this new Type of monster takes today’s digital technology and turns it into Dueling technology!

**Starter Deck: Link Strike** contains 43 cards: 38 Common Cards, 2 Ultra Rare Cards, 3 Super Rare Cards, 1 Beginner’s Guide, and 1 updated Game Mat with new Extra Monster Zones.
