Hasbro has just announced its largest-ever San Diego Comic-Con 2017 exclusive, the G.I. Joe Cobra Missile Command Headquarters. The set is a faithful reproduction of the original 1982 release, including the missile base, missile support systems, cruise missile, control panel, movable elevator, work platform, and seats. The set also comes with three figures that were included in the original box, Cobra Commander (with a logo that is an homage to the original, first version Cobra Commander logo), Cobra Officer, and Cobra Trooper. A set of character file cards and a holder are also included.
