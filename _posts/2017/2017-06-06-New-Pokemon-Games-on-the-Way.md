![Pokken Tournament DX](/images/pokemon/PTDX.jpg){: .float-right}
During today’s Pokémon Direct presentation, The Pokémon Company announced the latest Pokémon titles for Nintendo consoles.

The first item is Pokémon's first foray onto the Nintendo Switch with Pokkén Tournament DX. This updated version of the popular Pokémon fighting game will contain all the content from the Wii U title, along with Decidueye as a playable character, new support Pokémon, Team Battle mode, Group Match mode, daily challenges, and more. All characters will be unlocked and available to play right from the start of the game. There will also be a new replay feature that allows players to share their best matches online. Pokkén Tournament DX will launch on Nintendo Switch September 22, 2017.

Next up is Pokémon Ultra Sun and Pokémon Ultra Moon. New forms of both Solgaleo and Lunala were shown, but no additional info on them was given. Pokémon Ultra Sun and Pokémon Ultra Moon are described as "powered up" new editions of the titled with new additions to the story and new features. Worldwide release will be November 17, 2017, with more information coming later in the year.

Last, but certainly not least, will be the release Pokémon Gold & Silver on the Nintendo Virtual Console. Similar to Red, Blue, and Yellow, the games will be presented in their original forms with the added ability to trade over wireless and connect to the Pokémon Bank. Both titles will be available on September 22, 2017.

Overall we're getting 5 "new" titles that I'm fairly excited about. I haven't played Sun or Moon yet, so the Ultimate versions are certainly on my radar for the end of the year. Pokkén Tournament certainly needed some of the updates it's getting to stay fresh. A quick port of the Switch seems like a smart move to bring Switch users over to the franchise. As for Gold & Silver on the VC? That was a no-brainer. I'm sure we'll continue to see the older games released in this fashion so new Pokémon players can get a feel of the series' roots.

Still. A mainline Pokémon game for the Switch would have been nice, as would any new entry at all in the series. Those who've already purchased Pokémon Sun & Moon might get a bit miffed at having to buy a whole new game for updates instead of a DLC pack. The upgrading of Pokkén Tournament stings a bit less since it's not like it's staying on the Wii U, but people have grown to expect a new title to be released on a new system.

So now we know the timeline for Pokémon in 2017. Here's hoping we'll get something shiny and new in 2018.
