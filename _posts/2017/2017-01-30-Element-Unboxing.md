I just received my copy of Element from Rather Dashing Games over the weekend and I've been dying for a chance to sit down and take some pictures of it. While there's not much in the box, what is in there looks great. The sage's have a really nice feel, similar to the pawns in Onitama. The embroidered bag was much larger than I expected and also of a much higher quality than I thought it would be!

The entire package is excellent overall. I can't wait to really dig into this game and put it through its paces.
