title: Mapping and its utility within public health
---

Maps are without a doubt the best way to visualise spatial information. Want to know how to get from A to B? You can use a map. Want to know where the nearest Tesco is? You can use a map. The utility of maps in day to day life is probably taken for granted by most of us – we use them without realising. Sat-Nav, GoogleMaps™ and AppleMaps™, although digital, are maps and work on the same premises established thousands of years ago - they visualise information in geographical space.

Now, we can consider that any process can be defined by two simple factors: where it happened, and when it happened. These are referred to as spatial and temporal events respectfully. Everything that happens, happens somewhere and at some time.

It’s amazing when you consider the wealth of spatial temporal data out there. People can track their daily run using Strava™, can upload geotagged photos to Instagram™, Twitter™ and Facebook™, and can share their current location with a tap of a button using their iPhone™ or Android™. Well, now that we’re aware that all this spatial-temporal data exists – why can’t we use it to help inform public health? Short answer: We can, and people do!

Spatial Epidemiology may sound like a relatively new branch of science, what with the development of GPS and satellite data, but people have been mapping where diseases and their vectors (i.e. mosquitoes, ticks, flies) occur for centuries (believe it or not)!

The most famous example is that of John Snow (no, not the leading character from Game of Thrones), a 19th century physician working in London during the period of a large Cholera outbreak (~1850’s). He is known as “the founding father of epidemiology” for his work on mapping the locations where Cholera infections had occurred and tying this data to information which could be used to inform future disease risk. For example, by mapping wells and water pumps and comparing their spatial distribution with that of Cholera cases (see the amazing map below), John identified potential sources of infection.

Nowadays the premise of spatial epidemiology is much the same, however, we now have a wealth of available satellite data informing us of environmental conditions across space (such as vegetation coverage, elevation, land-surface temperature, precipitation etc.) which can be used alongside statistical models and information on disease occurrence to predict where future cases may occur. 

Thankfully (for people like me – the non-statistician), there are software packages and existing models which just require the input of information on the location of disease occurrence, and some covariates (satellite data or explanatory variables [in simple terms]) to inform estimates of where diseases may occur. Pretty cool, eh? These packages make the discipline of spatial epidemiology widely available for those interested in estimating spatial disease risk.

By using Twitter™ and Google™ posts and searches, researchers have been able to assimilate data on ongoing epidemics (see Google Flu Trends, for example) to inform the public of locations which might be experiencing high levels of disease occurrence. In the era of 'big data' such freely available data-sets prove to be a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease control and prevention.
