We had four fantastic speakers from ControlPlane, Microsoft, and Harness joining our July Cloud Native London meetup at eSynergy. We also had virtual attendees joining us via Rambly and the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/),  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) for your generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Andrew Martin from ControlPlane with a great talk on Hacking Kubernetes: Live Demo Marathon (starting at [1:34](https://youtu.be/0jJHRLLNgpY?t=94)). He talked about how:

* Supply chain attacks can get into all sorts of gnarly places, and we need to defend ourselves in depth and use 2FA everywhere
* Threat modelling and scanning for CVEs is minimal viable cloud native security
* But nothing is entirely secure, and running intrusion detection is the last line of defence

Then we had Mark Whitby from Microsoft who told us about Innovation and collaboration - A tour of Microsoft contributions to the CNCF (starting at [34:47](https://youtu.be/0jJHRLLNgpY?t=2087)). His takeaways mention: 

* Find out more about Microsoft and open source software, including how to get started in open source, links to projects and open source jobs at Microsoft at the dedicated Microsoft Open Source site - https://opensource.microsoft.com/
* There are links to many of the projects discussed in this session at https://github.com/Azure/container-compute-upstream. Details for the rest can be found on the CNCF projects page - https://www.cncf.io/projects/
* If you work for a software company , Microsoft have programs to support you which include free developer tools, Azure credits, technical engagement and free licensing. The programs include the Founders Hub for Startups and the ISV Success Program for later stage. Email the UK Team if you want to learn more - ISVUK@Microsoft.com 

Finally we had Prithvi Raj and Sunil Anjin from Harness who wrapped up our evening inviting us to Let's talk Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos (starting at [1:18:20](https://youtu.be/0jJHRLLNgpY?t=4700)). Their takeaways talked about: 

* Modern Chaos Engineering practices should not be limited to SecOps rather a Chaos First principle should be adopted which the entire developer ecosystem can leverage
* Observability and Open API lifecycle should be treated as a commodity instead of just a meagre addition.
* Chaos Engineering practices should not be a vision only for the ‘experts’ but it should be an easy and common practice available for everyone. Litmus is one such tool which can help ease the intricacies and aid in easy scenario creations.

And of course, our usual group photo!
