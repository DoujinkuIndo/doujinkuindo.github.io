My favourite exercise app at the moment isÂ 
[7 Minute Workout Challenge](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/7-minute-workout-challenge/id680170305?mt=8). It's simple to use, it has video's to show you what to do and it tells you what to do and when. It's like a '7 minute personal trainer' every morning.

As of today I've done this workout for 14 days straight. Feeling better for it. :)
