Itâ€™s very important that your private keys are kept secure and away from prying eyes.

A good place to keep your private keys is in the folder
`~/.ssh` as this makes it easier to manage (this is a subfolder of your home folder).

You then want to set the permissions of the private key file to
600.

`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/privatekeyfile.pem`

Then you can ssh to the server from the command line using:

`ssh -i ~/.ssh/privatekeyfile.pem.pem root@fqdn -p 22`
