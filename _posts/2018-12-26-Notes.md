Bhikkhu Bodhi, [Systematic Study of the Majjhima NikƒÅya, episode III.3 on MN 41](https://bodhimonastery.org/a-systematic-study-of-the-majjhima-nikaya.html), comments on buddhist teachers interpreting "being reborn" (in hell) as simply meaning "mental states" (in this life, not _actual_ rebirth). He points out the stock phrase used every time rebirth is mentioned in the Theravada Canon: "on the dissolution of the body, after death". Clearly, the Buddha is talking about rebirth, not psychology. This is a modernist rewrite.
