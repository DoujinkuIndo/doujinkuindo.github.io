#### Difference between K-nearest neighbors and K-means algorithms

Yes they are both different! Most people tend to assume both the algorithms to be similar because of the same 'k' in their names but they are not!

K-nearest neighbors is a classification algorithm which is supervised in nature. You have a list of things already classified into groups, and your goal would be to assign a new thing into the group it is closest to. Here 'k' is the number of the closest things you would check before classifying the new thing. 

K-Means is a clustering algorithm which is unsupervised in nature. You have a list of objects which have a hidden pattern and your goal is to cluster without any guidance. Here k is the number of clusters.
