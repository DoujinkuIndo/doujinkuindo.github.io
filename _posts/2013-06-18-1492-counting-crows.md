# 1492 — Counting Crows

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laI8byoP4iE God save me — I learned something from a youtube [comment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laI8byoP4iE&lc=20U_XP02KhbPnzCBywtWwuqCev9sogvUtUeaS1eUkQg). And here it is — this is a great song, unexpected and brilliant and poetic in its own way, but it is a song by a band that's been around for long enough. They have nothing to prove. They think it sounds great ( I happen to agree ) and they want to play it. They don't need to sell it, and they don't need to doll it up in the rock'n'roll lifestyle to do so. And so you get a return to the rock from the 70s and 80s, where music videos would really focus on the musicianship of the guitarists and drummers, rather than the story and celebrity of the lead singer. So I really like this.
