# Malleability and Italian Food from Queens: Family, Family Restaurant, and New York Sarcasm

Dinner with relatives tonight, out in Queens. The Family Restaurant. Big, heavy italian dishes. On the way home, I got into a fantastic argument with my cousin Derek about the usefulness of learning a foreign language. I argued that it would become obsolete due to technological advances in just a few short years. He argued that learning another language had value in changing the way your brain worked, the way you thought about things. I argued that was true for any kind of learning. The discussion became heated. We swapped sides. He refused to generalize. I refused to back down. It was an excellent discussion, but I wanted it to go to bigger places â€“ what does it mean to have a thinking pattern? If our thinking styles are changing constantly, how do we define the self? I was (am!) a little intimidated by the idea that something like a language can get into my brain and move stuff around. He wanted to keep it low-level. Learning Chinese made him a more specific writer. He kept swimming around my arguments. A few cousins told me that people are more polite in the midwest, that I'll have to watch out in Illinois, that my biting wit and sarcasm could make me a threat, something confusing; that my New York charms might not be as charming elsewhere. They mistook my honest deadpan for sarcastic deadpan, and my sarcastic sentence for an honest sentence. Meeting new people at Saltz, I have the same problem. Too much of an age divide or a sarcasm divide can be an issue. Should I wait for them to come around to me? Or should I actively 'improve' myself, make myself more accessible? How malleable are we? I like to think we can choose to stay consistent and strong and not switch opinions and personalities by the whims of whoever we're around. But I also like to think we're flexible, not hardasses, easy-going, polite, adaptable.
