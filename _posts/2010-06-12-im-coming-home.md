Dubai internet is once again being an ass, so I&#8217;ll just link pictures for the moment&#8230;.

Holy crap Dubai is crazy. The heat sucks, it&#8217;s in the middle of nowhere, and it has a bazillion awesome things to do. I don&#8217;t know how it works, and I don&#8217;t question it.

Flew in last night and even at about 10 or 11pm it was seriously close to 30 degrees. I quickly worked out my hotel that on the map looked way close to everything turned out to be close to nothing. Meh, whatever, the room was awesome and a touch of luxury after living in hostel dorms, and as it turns out the taxis are cheaper than chips&#8230; well, not if they&#8217;re chips with sauce and other condiments because I&#8217;m on a budget here, and those extras cut into that&#8230; Speaking of which, I had 2 servings of chips with cheesy/nacho type sauce all over them today. Ok, so I can afford that, but yeh, the taxis are cheap so today I&#8217;ve pretty much been chauffered around the place.

In the morning I started off at The Mall of The Emirates where I was way keen to hit the slopes (swear I&#8217;m not being racist, Simon) and go for a bit of a snowboard session. 2 hours for about $60-80, including all rentals and whatnot. Was awesome fun, but I was well knackered after it.

After a little shopping, I moved on to Atlantis, which is that hotel at the top of that palm-shaped island. Drove past the Al Arab hotel (that 7-star hotel) on the way. The taxi driver offered to take a photo of me in front of it. So look at that first picture:

Ok, now here&#8217;s the one the cabbie took of me.

So go back to that first picture, and now pretend I&#8217;m standing in front of that hotel. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s _supposed_ to look like, and when it&#8217;s that huge I&#8217;m really not sure how he missed getting it in the frame. You might be able to tell I started pissing myself laughing at this point, not sure he knew what was going on&#8230;

Anyway Atlantis was ok, I went walking around an aquarium which looked really cool&#8230;

After all this I made my way to Dubai Mall, the world&#8217;s biggest (I think), right next to the world&#8217;s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. As soon as I saw it my initial reaction was kinda like Homer&#8217;s after receiving the giant Foster&#8217;s can &#8211; &#8220;Yeh, I guess it&#8217;s pretty big.&#8221; It&#8217;s obviously large, but it&#8217;s not really all that impressive&#8230; well not from the street anyway. There&#8217;s tons of super-high-rise buildings around so it&#8217;s kinda like looking at a 7&#8242; tall guy in a room full of people 6&#8217;6&#8243;&#8230;

Back to the mall for a second&#8230; this place was so big I literally got lost in it. Insane. Took me about 3 hours to walk through the whole thing, and funnily enough there was seriously maybe 5 or 6 shops I really looked at. Picked up a few things and managed to burn through most of the rest of my cash. Good times.

Dubai, you&#8217;ve been rad. I shall see you again!
