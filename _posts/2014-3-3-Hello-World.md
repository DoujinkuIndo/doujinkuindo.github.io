  Machine Learning is a large field that is taking the field of finance and banking by storm. Businesses are now using algorithms to personalize a customers experience and to find areas where they can improve. The Santander Group is a banking organization that posted a challenge on Kaggle in hopes to make their banking services more personalized. The goal of the challenge is to build a regression model that can be used to predict the monetary value of a potential customerâ€™s transactions.  In doing so, they can tailor their products and services to specific customers and gain a technological advantage over other banking organizations.
