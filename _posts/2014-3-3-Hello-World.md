Welcome to our blog! We are a undergraduate college research group investigating a suspicious x-ray source in the open cluster NGC6819 and will update this blog weekly on our findings. The group is led by Dr. Natalie Gosnell and consists of Rory Lowe, Marta Nowatka, and Thom Ory. Marta is taking care of astrometry for this project, and Thom is assisted by Rory with the photometry. Our individual blogs are each updated daily and can be found under the "People" tab above.
