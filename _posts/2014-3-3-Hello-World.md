title: Hello World!

After a few weeks of trying to get a blog up and running I am finally here making my first blog post. I will be posting here on a regular basis about my voyage into the world of web development, and other miscellaneous topics. Readers beware. 

It amazes me that about half a year ago I had little to no knowledge of the field of web development and now here I am writing my own GitHub blog, and just finishing up my personal portfolio. It has a been a great ride, with ups and downs and a quite a few head scratching moments. But, this is still just the beginning. Having already familiarized myself with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (including jQuery), it has only made me want to continue to delve into the many other aspects of web development. I am currently focusin on the ins and outs of GitHub and how to utilize it's tools properly. That is what I love about web development, there is never a shortage of new things to learn. That's all I got for now, but I will be back soon.
