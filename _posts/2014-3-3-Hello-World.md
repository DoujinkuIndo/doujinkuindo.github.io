"Hello World", this wonderful string that we have all printed when learning our first programming language or acquiring a new one.  
This blog post will serve the same purpose as the "Hello World" string; short, meaningless but indicating the start of something fresh. After years of reading wonderful blogs   
like [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Dev Community](https://dev.to/), [SimpleProgrammer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/) and other fantastic blogs/blogging platforms, I've finally decided to start a blog for myself where I can start writing and give back to the world along with polishing my writing skills :smiley:  
  
  
# Reasons for Starting this Journal/Blog 
  *"Necessity is the mother of invention"* is how the English Proverb goes, this was true for me when I started my internship in Istanbul at a wonderful company called [etcBase](https://www.etcbase.com/) and where I currently am working! 
### 1. Documentation
  In the first four months of my internships, I had been learning in override mode while working with a plethora of tools! After all I was solving problems which were unique; problems which did not have a ready-made solution as compared in academia where one can find solutions at the end of the book(or in a solution's manual). 
  So in this situation I had to collaborate with developers specially when using opensource projects, along with that searching the web far and wide for resources regarding *"how to do X thing in Y technology"*, plus reading documentations of those products in order to solve specific bugs or implement features. Thus this enabled me to solve problems which in their sense were unique. 
  After sometime I found myself stumped when a fellow colleague at work ask me "How did you mitigate that X problem?"; that is when I thought that I should start documenting my work in place. Eventually I intend that this blog apart from my personal musings will serve as a sort of *Development Journal*. 
### 2. Giving Back to the Community
