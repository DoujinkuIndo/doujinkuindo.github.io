title: First Blog Post!
---

"Hello World", this wonderful string that we have all printed when learning our first programming language or acquiring a new one.
This blog post will serve the same purpose as the "Hello World" string; short, meaningless but indicating the start of something fresh. After years of reading wonderful blogs 
like Medium, Dev Community, SimpleProgrammer and other fantastic blogs/blogging platforms, I've finally decided to start a blog for myself where I can practice my writing skills on:
1. Myself (insert a dash of narcissism)
2. Technology I use and learn
3. Photography and Philosophy

and everything else...
