title: Hi, I am Rishi.

I am an entrepreneurial and data-driven product manager. When building products, my aim is to always solve for the user, and leveraging technology to build scalable solutions.

### About Me

I am an ardent believer of technology’s inherent power to influence human behavior and actions. As a Product Manager, I get to use my long-standing love of tech to create products for everyday humans. Combining user research, data-driven design and a healthy dose of interactive prototyping, I aim to create intuitive interfaces and solve the right problems for the right customers.

This my personal space for aggregating all the interesting posts and articles I share on Twitter.
