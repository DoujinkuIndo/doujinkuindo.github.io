Not everyone can learn how to program within 6 months of learning a few of the modern languages from scratch (HTML / CSS / Javascript).

It was scary at first. But now I’m getting the hang of it. Now I can look back and chuckle a little, remembering how the fear and confusion would settle in when I could feel the computer staring back at me with its loops and functions. The classic Javascript conundrum…
	

I have created this e-document as a memoire for myself to look back on. It reminds me of my humble beginnings. This is also for those friends of mine who are learning the path along with me… As well as for those seeking partnership in the domains of business.

For you, I am grateful because I learn through your mistakes and successes, too.
