Hi, my name is Nicolas Fabre.

I started to get into programming in 2015 after finishing my master's degree in geograpy and working in Aix-en-Provence, France, at the regional planning and urbanism institute as a cartographic engineer.

After starting self-teaching web development, I attended and graduated in 2017 from
[WebForce3](http://www.wf3.fr/pret-a-tout-changer/developpeur-symfony), a coding bootcamp introducing to HTML,
CSS, JS, OOP in PHP, Wordpress, SQL and Git.

After free-lancing for few months with the folks at [OhMyDevs!](https://www.ohmydevs.fr/equipe/), I decided to
look for an experience in a company that would present me with new challenges to overcome.

I interned at [Boaterly](https://www.boaterfly.com/en) in 2017, to work on its web application for a boat rental marketplace. I learned about Ruby and Rails 3 and started to deploy fully tested, production ready code in an Agile environnement.

I then started to work on projects for Boaterfly's parent company, [Dream Yacht Charter](https://www.dreamyachtcharter.com/), as a full-time web developper in 2018.

I've recently worked on developping a search engine for boat rentals on Rails 5 and React 16.
