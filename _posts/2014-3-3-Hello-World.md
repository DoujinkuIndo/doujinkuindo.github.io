title: The Possible Start of New Beginnings

I've setup this site using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and I'm hopeful it might be where I transfer my exising [blog](http://ben.hamilton.id.au/) to.

It would mean an export of those posts from WordPress into markdown files, and the use of [custom domains on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).
