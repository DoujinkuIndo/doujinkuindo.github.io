Ok, it's mine 4th or 5th approach to blogging. Before blogging I was author of pl.comp.www (written first in linuxdoc, later in DocBook). In meantime I use nibylog, other bash solution, Umbraco, any other on ASP.NET, wordpress. Time back to root, and just generate files in any kind simple text generator. This time with local editor but also with web interface like github. :)
