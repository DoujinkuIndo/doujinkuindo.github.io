hello world!!
As a CS student I always had a dream to have an own website .So, here I am.
I am Saurabh Kumar .You can call me "panjiara",this is my title isn't cool!!
As a kid I always had tendency to open all my toys and see how they work , I was amazed to see the function of motor or dynamo
how to rotate by just connecting to the cell terminal.
