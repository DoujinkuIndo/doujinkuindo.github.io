title: Basic reminders about C pointers
---

A pointer is a variable. This variable contains the address of another one. This other one can be a primitive type, a structure, an object ( in C++ ) but also another pointer.

A simple example of what a pointer is can be discovered using this simple code :

```cpp
int variable = 5;
printf("%d", variable);
```
