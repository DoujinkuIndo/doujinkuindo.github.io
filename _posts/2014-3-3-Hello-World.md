On my blog i am going to be posting about what we have done in IT. Sometimes it might not be about IT but it will mostly be IT.
In IT we are working on building PacMan on scratch. I enjoy the fact that we have to work out most of the coding and if we are stuck then the teacher will only give us tips. The thing that I need to work on in IT is listening to instructions because if I don't then you can easily fall behind.

Today I created my website and customised it to the way that I wanted it to look like. It was a very difficult task but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I need to work on learning how to change what it says on my website.
