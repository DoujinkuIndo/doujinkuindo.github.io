title: Control Christmas decorations with RaspberryPi

Christmas is around the corner and it is time for some Christmas Crafts! Got an RaspberryPi from a hack night at iZettle and wanted to make something fun out of it, decided on "Git-merge activated snowglobe". If the name doesn't say it all, it's an electronic snowglobe that is gonna start "snowing" and playing christmas music each time someone merges a pull request on Github.

So what you need:
- RaspberryPi
- Electric snowglobe or similar that can be turned on by button
- Cables (like these: http://goo.gl/jYLQuW)
- Tape (some people would probably advocate soldering here)
- Tools for opening the snowglobe

This is the snowglobe I found at a toys store. It plays 8 songs, whisps around some styrofoam and is powered by 3 1.5v AA batteries. Opening it up it was really easy to modify it by cutting the cables. I started out with
