title: What is Data Science ?
---

The simplest way to define Data Science is the extraction of actionable information from raw data. This multidisciplinary field has the primary goal of identifying trends, patterns, connections and correlations in large data sets.

Data science includes a wide variety of tools and techniques such as computer programming, predictive analysis, mathematics, statistics or artificial intelligence. Data Science now also includes Machine Learning algorithms.

Today, almost all companies claim to practice Data Science in some form or another. However, the methods and approaches used may vary from one organization to another.
