My Name is **Prince Kumar Lat**. I am an _Indian_ by birth and I have been living in the beautiful city of **_Burnaby, Canada_**, since September 2015. 

I have a background in engineering with deep interest in biology. I am an interdisciplinary researcher working on the non-conventional functional properties of DNA and RNA using tools of bioinformatics, data science, biophysics, biochemistry and molecular biology. Nucleic Acids (DNA/RNA) are one of the most fundamental biopolymer in cells where DNA provides the instructions (code) for cellular activity and RNA decodes (convert) those code into functional proteins to carry out the cellular function. I aim to make use of my programming, teamwork, and mathematical skills for social good. I have a passion for promoting science within the community and a quest to improve the quality of human health though a combination of scientific innovation and technological development.

When I am away from my lab, I enjoy playing flute and tabla (Indian Drum). Occasionally, I spend few evenings writing poetries in my mother tongue (Hindi).
