title: OOP PROGRAMMING

OOP has become a standard way of programming.OOP makes your programs more flexible and understandable.OOP code is a lot neater and organized because if your want to add on a new capability you just create a new function without touching any of the old code.
OOP requires less code to get things done because of a concept called inheritance.For example if we created a basic car object.The car object is what we would refer to as the superclass.A class is a blueprint that describes how to build many objects.
So how does a class create an objeect? Each object will have variables called instance variables in OOP.Each object will recieve functions called methods in OOP.Each object has the ability to easily overide those functions it can't use.
If we create a subclass of the superclass,in OOP this is known as extending the superclass.
Inheritance is good:decreases duplicate code,eliminates looking for what code needs to be changed,avoids breaking previously working code and simplifies your code  overall.
Overloadind methods-This is to create multiple methods with the same name but either a different return type,number of arguments or type of arguments.
