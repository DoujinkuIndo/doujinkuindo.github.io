Thailand, my motherland, will hold an election in March 24th, 2019. The purpose of this blogpost is to predict what outcome can we expect from the recent change in electoral system i.e. how members of Paliaments (MPs) are allocated. 
First we will start off with some historical background (which you can skip if already known to you), then we will learn about two main electoral systems that are relevant to our discussion, and then we will apply them to the context of Thailand. We will take the outcome of 2014 election and apply it to 2019 election.

# 1. Historical background

Thailand has been through rough and tough time politically since the military coup of 2006. The country has since changed 6 prime ministers 4 constitutions. Due to international pressure as well as domestic discontent, the military regime is forced to hold a Democratic election in March 2019. However, no one fails to notice that the recent changes in the constitution is brought about by the military dictatorship regime to curtail the power of the major populist party. Among many changes, one that trigger my attention is the method of members of Parliament allocation.

# 2. Electoral System

We will consider two methods that are used in recent Thai election; as well as the methods of rounding. First is called **two-tier (proportional) party list** which was implemented in the Thailand constitution of 1997, and the second is called **mixed membered apportionment** which is implemented in Thailand constitution of 2016, and will be used in this up-coming election.

### two-tier party list
Most readers may not be familiar with the party list representation. Essentially, members of Parlianment (MPs) are grouped into two: voting-district winners and elected party-list members. Let's say a country is divided into 400 voting districts, we will have 400 MPs. Additional 100 parliamentarian seats, called party list, are given to a party based on the number of nation-wide popular votes. One way to allocate party list is to make it **proportional** to the whole nation-wide popular votes. In our example, suppost 300 districts are won by party A, and 100 districts are won by party B. A gets additional 75 seats as party lists, and B gets 25 seats.


### mixed member apportionment
Similar to the two-tier party list system, constituents choose district representatives. Nation-wide votes are counted to determine how many total representatives each party will be allocated; let's call this number the apportioning seats. **The additional party list MPs will be added (if at all) to the district representatives to make the total MPs of a given party equals the apportioning seats.**
This creates a funny situation when a party wins more districts than the apportioning seats are given to them. The district winners above the apportioning seats are called **overhang seats**. That party will not get any more party-list seats. 
Imagine, party A wins all districts by a very small margin for each district, A will gets all all district representatives, but it's unlikely that A will get a party list.

This way of allocating seats give a small party (often single-issued party) a chance to be represented, because even if it doesn't win any district, it might be awarded party list. However, it punishes a big party, by not awarding any additional seats in case of overhang.

*The overhang seats will be important later on when we see the situation in Thailand.*

### Method of rounding
Often when a party list is allocated to parties, the exact proportionality is not possible one has to round the proportional seats often a fractional number to a whole number. The question is to round up or round down, and how to keep the total seats after rounding under the desired number. There are numbers of methods, but the method used in Thailand election is called Jefferson Method.

#### Jefferson method (Highest average method)
Named after Thomas Jefferson who introduced this method to allocate the congressional seats to states in 1791, this method first allocates seats to the whole number of proportional seats disregard the remainders (decimal points). If there is any remaining seats, they are allocated first to highest remainders, and so on.


# 3. 2014 Election Result
Thailand has a lot of political parties (53 parties run in 2014). We have, however, 2 main parties: Puer Thai (PT) party, a more economically liberal, rural-based, showing populism tendency (sort of like Bernie Sanders); and Democratic party, more economically conservative, urban-oriented, and has tie to elite establishment (sort of like Bush-Romney type).

Below is the 2014 election map. Notice the regionalism. The red represents provinces won by Puer Thai, and the blue represents provinces won by Democratic party.
