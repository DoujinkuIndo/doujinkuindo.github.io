Hey Guys! I was just getting ready to blog. Just need to learn more about Jekyll and need to toy with some themes. 
Content will be pushed a little later. Until then, you can play some of the games I made recently: 


 - [Zaptor](vilbeyli.github.io/Zaptor/), A 2D Space-shooter. If you want to cheat, go ahead, press Backspace!
 - [Pacman](https://vilbeyli.github.io/Pacman/), A pacman clone with increasing difficulty on each level. There are highscores! Get your name up there. 
 
See you soon!
