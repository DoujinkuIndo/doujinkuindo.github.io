A hilarious game of Cards Against Containers I played with Kelsey Hightower, Ian Coldwater and more in support of Black Girls Code. Over $3000 was donated to Black Girls Code. Thanks Chris Kranz for inviting me to this fantastic initiative!

The players were:

* Ahmet Alp Balkan, Senior Developer Advocate, Google
* Alex Ellis, CNCF Ambassador, Founder of OpenFaaS & Inlets
* Cheryl Hung, VP Ecosystem, CNCF
* Duffie Cooley, VMware
* Ian Coldwater, Lead Platform Security Engineer, Heroku
* Kelsey Hightower, Staff Developer Advocate, Google Cloud
