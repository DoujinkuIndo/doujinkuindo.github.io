    I&#8217;m hitting up Bern in Switzerland at the moment.

After Berlin Ash and Drew decided on Prague and since everyone seems to rant and rave on about that place I figured I may as well come for the ride and at least overnight there. So maybe I&#8217;m missing the point, but honestly Prague has been the biggest let down so far. For a place everyone hypes up it really just seemed like any other European city without any of it&#8217;s own real personality. In the night Ash, Drew and I went out and got dinner. [BEST DINNER EVER](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0937.jpg). Full of pork with a side of red cabbage sauerkraut.

I was hoping to fly directly from Prague to Venice or Rome but flights were stupidly expensive and complicated (long stopovers) so I settled for hitting up Munich instead. I did always want to go there but I figured it just wasn&#8217;t going to happen with everything else I wanted to do but you know what, I&#8217;m glad my plans buggered up and that I had to &#8216;settle&#8217; on going there instead of Venice (for the moment anyway). Munich is easily the best city I&#8217;ve been to so far, it&#8217;s [beautiful](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0960.jpg), has plenty of [character](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0955.jpg) and there&#8217;s just so much to see and do.

I arrived in Munich pretty much homeless. And I also discovered 4:30 in the afternoon, in the middle of Summer, is not a good time to try and find a hostel. All were booked up so I had to settle for one of the cheapest hotels I could find&#8230; You would think it would be a welcome change from a hostel, but for my first night away from my pals I was kinda looking forward to making friends. Oh well! The afternoon I got there I did what I normally do and checked out the city by foot. No idea how far I walked, but I was gone for a good 5-6 hours and my feet were done for!

The next day I rented the [coolest bike ever](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0983.jpg) and decided to explore things that way and give my feet a rest. I pretty much just picked a direction and rode as far as I could until I hit something interesting&#8230; I came across the zoo&#8230; didn&#8217;t go in but I could see a [few things from the side of the road](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0978.jpg). around the area is a big river and [lots of trees](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0979.jpg), almost forest like&#8230; Was good fun just being out of the city. Came back to the hostel later in the afternoon and came across Jo, a girl we all met on the train to Prague who also stayed in our hostel there. Found out about a Beer Challenge and decided to head along to it. Very fun night. Very hazy too.

That about brings us to today. Caught a 7am train to Bern (waking up has never been so hard!) and damn the scenery is picturesque through Bavaria down to the Swiss Alps. It&#8217;s just so goddamn beautiful. Speaking of the alps, I&#8217;ve been noticing I&#8217;ve been getting way puffed out walking up here, particularly with the steep hills I have to scale.

Anyway there&#8217;s a pretty [fast flowing river](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_1007.jpg) through here and you can jump in one end, and about a kilometre or two downstream you wind up at the free public pools&#8230; It was awesomely refreshing, particularly on a day like today which I think was low to mid 30&#8217;s.

Loving every minute of this place, definitely a place I want to come back to in future, would love to see Lucerne too but can&#8217;t do it all, right? Tomorrow night I think I&#8217;ll catch an overnight train into Venice. Gonna be rad!
