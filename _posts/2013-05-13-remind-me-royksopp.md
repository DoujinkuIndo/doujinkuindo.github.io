# Remind Me — Royksopp

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gy_zq_YuQQ In praise of air travel and public transportation: of one-hit wonders and songs I'll never hear twice, played on the radio in a train station or an airport, remembering only a vague snippet, frantic googling, excited to see you've truly found it; in praise of listening to the rest of the song and readjusting your expectations to its reality; in praise of music from other parts of the world and other other sensibilities. This is trip-hop, European, chill-out music, electronic and humanized, a driving beat and a jaunty melody, but with intonations and subtleties all its own, defying analysis or description, only enjoyment.
