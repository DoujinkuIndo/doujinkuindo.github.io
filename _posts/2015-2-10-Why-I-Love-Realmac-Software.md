title: Why I Love Realmac Software
---

Everyone has that one thing that really gets them hyped. For me, it's software for Apple products. It doesn't matter if it's for iOS or OS X, I love exploring new applications. Some people obsess over sports and can tell you ever stat of every player on every team. I couldn't care less. I enjoy apps.

A few years ago I was introduced to a company called Realmac Software when they launched their iPhone app called Clear. Clear's simple, yet intuitive, design really struck me as cleaver. I won't go into much detail here, as Clear has been reviewed over and over again on the web. What I would rather quickly discuss are the people behind Clear; the Realmac Software team.

It wouldn't be fair to say that my time using Realmac Software apps has been all hunky dory--did someone say something about Clear+ or Ember for iOS? While Realmac's software has had its shares of ups and downs, it has won me over for life, and here's why.

Whether I was having difficulty making an in-app purchase or trying to sync my iPad and Mac over iCloud, Realmac Software has had some of the best support in the app world. How have they accomplished this? They listen. I'm not entirely sure who monitors their Twitter account, but there have been plenty of times I've reached out for help and been promptly replied to by someone signing the tweet with "--T." No matter the level of my frustration, the Realmac Team has always kept their cool and helped me fix every single issue I've come across.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, I'll support Realmac Software for life. They have this sixth sense of knowing what I'll need out of my software before I do and they do it both elegantly and effectively. Maybe not always correctly, but they always fix the problem. I'll show my Apple fanboy-ness a little more by pointing out that Realmac does exactly what Jony Ive says is required for good design: (1) learn to care, (2) learn how to focus and (3) be prepared to screw up and throw things away.

I can't tell you how surprised I was when I got home from work on Friday to find a package waiting for me. I was even more surprised when I saw the package was from outside of the U.S.. It was from the Realmac Team, just thanking me. So I thank them; for everything good they've brought to me and how they have made my life infinitely easier. Thank you for everything!
