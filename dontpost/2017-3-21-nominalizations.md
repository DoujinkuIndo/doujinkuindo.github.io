title: Nominalization
---

Let's talk about nominalization. First, what is it? Nominalization refers to the use of a word that is not a noun as a noun. For example, convert a verb

"We expanded into a new business sector" becomes "We make an expansion into a new business sector"

 Instead of a verb driving the sentence forward, you have a boring verb (make) and a large noun.


We can do the same with adjectives: "She is honest" becomes "She has honesty." Again, this makes a simple sentence more complex.


Nominalization isn't grammatically incorrect, but it's often bad writting.


With all that out of the way, let's talk about how to identify nominalization in writing, and identify when it's being misused.







Sometimes nominalization isn't a bad thing. For example, sometimes the nominalized noun will be more familiar to people, such as "" consultant?
