How do the methods, materials, and technologies of human communication shape 
religion, politics, popular culture, and the circulation of knowledge? Can we 
tie the invention of writing to the origins of cities? Would the ‘religions of the book’ 
have flourished in the Middle Ages without the invention of the codex? Is it true that 
the printing press made the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution possible? And did 
newspapers really encourage the Age of Revolutions? All these questions, and more, will 
be answered in the course of the semester, as we trace the history of human communication 
from its origins in the ancient Near East to its diffusion over the World Wide Web. 
Weekly units will focus on ‘revolutions’ within the history of communication to highlight 
how ‘new’ technologies of communication often spur broader cultural and societal change.

In addition to weekly thematic lectures and readings on the history of communication, 
the course will also introduce students to new digital methods of historical research a
nd archival preservation. Our latest revolution in communication—the emergence of digital 
languages, interfaces, and platforms—has transformed how historians and archivists 
preserve and interact with the material evidence of communication in the past. In weekly 
“digital labs,” students will engage with cutting-edge digital archives to analyze the 
influence of the digital on the work of history, while also trying their hands at the 
digital tools that are making new kinds of historical research possible. 

The course has multiple goals:
1. Students will learn the broad chronology of the history of human communication. 
Special attention will be given to moments of ‘rupture’ when new methods of 
communication displaced the old, often inciting broader cultural and societal change.

1. Close engagement with digital archives will allow students to view and appreciate the 
material texts of the past.

1. Students will learn to analyze how digital archives make historical arguments through 
the representation and presentation of sources. Likewise, students will learn to 
recognize the limitations of digital archives, both as representations of material 
objects and as ephemeral—and often fragile—sources in their own right.

1. Finally, students will gain competency in a variety of “digital tools” which will 
allow them to communicate their own historical research to a broader public in 
digital format.
