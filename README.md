## GitHub and Jekyll Now

> Jekyll is a static site generator for GitHub hosted blogs.

Jekyll Now makes it easier to create a Jekyll blog by eliminating setup steps.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
