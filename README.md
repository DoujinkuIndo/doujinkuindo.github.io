# My website

## Building the website locally

From admin command prompt:

- `choco install jekyll` -- this failed with an error installing jekyll but did seem to install its dependencies
- `gem install github-pages`

Open a regular command prompt, and type `jekyll -v` to check that it worked.

- `jekyll serve`
