# ReadMe

The original readMe file describing Jekyll Now and the quick start and update process can be found at <https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/blob/master/README.md>. 

My own adaptations of this theme are so far purely experimental in an effort to learn more about how Jekyll works, so there's nothing very interesting or informative to be found here.
