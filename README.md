# Tinker Ideas

This is the repo where all Tinkerbox folks can easily create posts to share their knowdedge and storys.

## What It Does

It is a static site generator for Github hosted blogs.

## How It works

You fork/clone this repo, create a blog using any text editer you like, then send a push request back to master branch. That's it, your post will appears at [our offical blog site](https://tinkerbox.github.io).

## Requirements

Some git and markdown knowledge is needed.

## Quick Start

### Step 0) Some tools you need.

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) A easy way to install other command line tools on Mac OS.

```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is the blog engine to tranform .md text into static websites

```
$ gem install jekyll
```

[Git](http://git-scm.com/)

```
$ brew install git
```

### Step 1) Fork the reop to your User Repository and start to write blog

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tinkerbox/tinkerbox.github.io.git
```

Now you will have a local repo folder named `tinkerbox.github.io`, and the `_posts/` is the folder where all the company blogs will live. To create a new post, all you need to do is create a new file in the `_posts/` directory, and the blog MUST be in the following format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.MARKUP
```

`MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.textile
```

### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon

> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:

> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).
> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.
> 3. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Edit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://0.0.0.0:4000
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

## Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it probably won't get merged. :guardsman:
