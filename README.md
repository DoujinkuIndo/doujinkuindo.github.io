## Powered by GitHub Pages and Jekyll Now

Jekyll Now makes it easier to create a Jekyll blog and static site:

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
