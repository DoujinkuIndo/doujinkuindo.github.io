# A first stab at a github blog.

Currently based on barryclark's Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it [easier to create your Jekyll blog](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.
