# Dawit Elias personal portfolio + blog

Initial Setup forked from ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

I decided to go with **Jekyll** because of its light weight and minimalism, in comparison to platforms such as WordPress -- I simply don't need all those features. Also, Github is my CMS.. can't beat that!
