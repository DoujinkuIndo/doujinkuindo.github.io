# MomoDeve blog
Hi! This is repository for my blog about programming & gamedev. If you found some mistakes in my posts or have an idea how to make it better - feel free to contribute by creating a pull request. If you were just looking for my blog page, [click here](https://momodeve.github.io)

# How does it works
My blog is hosted on github pages, for web-pages I use static generator called [Jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Any changes in posts & pages are mode through this github repository and automatically trigger update of the website.
