# Maxwell Engineering Blog

The engineering blog was created using Jekyll Now.

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.


### Publish your first draft blog post 

Create a new file in the _drafts folder and open a PR for review of your content. 

Once the post is approved you can move it to the _posts directory and merge your PR to master.

This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

## Local Development

1. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/himaxwell/himaxwell.github.io.git`
2. `bundle install`
3. `jekyll serve --watch --drafts`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Moar (from Jekyll Now)!

I've created a more detailed walkthrough, [**Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages**](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) over at the Smashing Magazine website. Check it out if you'd like a more detailed walkthrough and some background on Jekyll. :metal:

It covers:

- A more detailed walkthrough of setting up your Jekyll blog
- Common issues that you might encounter while using Jekyll
- Importing from Wordpress, using your own domain name, and blogging in your favorite editor
- Theming in Jekyll, with Liquid templating examples
- A quick look at Jekyll 2.0’s new features, including Sass/Coffeescript support and Collections
