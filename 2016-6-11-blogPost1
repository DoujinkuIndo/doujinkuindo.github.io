My first week of being in this class has been very informative and interactive. However, the material has been breifly introduced towards me. Quizzes have been all over the place in terms of what to look through to prepare for each. So far, taking each quiz has made me feel like somone despreately trying to win the lottery; it takes a lot of luck to get each question right within such limited amount of time. Lectures have been much better than any of those from my past professors throughout my years so far in UT. On the positive side, he has reintroduced Python, a language I've been trained well during my internship years at Intel. Getting used to the software will take some time to adjusted in this class. I hope this class gets better and easier for me to understand the material.
