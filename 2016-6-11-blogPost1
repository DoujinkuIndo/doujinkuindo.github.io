What did you do this past week?

My first week of being in this class has been very informative and interactive. However, the material has been breifly introduced towards me. Quizzes have been all over the place in terms of what to look through to prepare for each. So far, taking each quiz has made me feel like somone despreately trying to win the lottery; it takes a lot of luck to get each question right within such limited amount of time. Lectures have been much better than any of those from my past professors throughout my years so far in UT. On the positive side, he has reintroduced Python, a language I've been trained well during my internship years at Intel. Getting used to the software will take some time to become more well adjusted in this class. I hope this class gets better and easier for me to understand the material.

What's in your way?

So far, I've been able to get all the desired files into my dev branch. However, pip isn't giving me permission to build Travis CI successfully.

What will you do next week?

For next week, I will try to find a partner in time so that I can coordinate with him/her on how to get started on the upcoming project. I will also try to look through the reading materials on chapters that I have missed.

Tip of the week

Become familiar with git and python ASAP through Codecademy. I have done that previously before the first class, and being familiar with those languages has benefitted me well to understand the basics of python.
