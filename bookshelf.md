This page lists the books I have read and some of my thoughts on each of them. Reading is one of my favorite ways of learning something new and exploring new worlds. Sometimes it's just a great way to take a break from the real world. 

* **The Hardware Hacker** by Andrew "bunnie" Huang -- A thoughtful, wide-ranging exploration of different topics from engineering, biology and manufacturing. I loved the author's willingness to ask questions and investigate - his curiosity is infectious and it also pays off in a very well written, informative book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in manufacturing, China as an industrial giant, open source legal issues, detective work and looking at DNA as a computer program.
