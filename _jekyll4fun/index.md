[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator, built in ruby. It provides an easy to use and configure platform for publishing your own personal website.

It has built in features to support blogs and you can run it out of github using github pages,  or any one of a number of other free hosting
options.

Best of all,  the content is simply plain markdown or html files.  Which means
no database to get corrupted, and you can migrate your content any time.

This is my getting started guide as presented in 2018 at Connect Tech conference.
It is designed to get you up and running with a functional site quickly and
then progressively dive into and expand the key concepts for managing your site.
