> Most people coming into contact with Buddhist literature and thought outside traditional Buddhist cultures are probably struck by the fact that it
seems to be full of lists. Indeed, nearly all introductory accounts of Buddhism straight away present the reader with two fundamental Buddhist lists: that of the noble eightfold path (ariyo atthangiko maggo) and that of the four noble truths (ariya-sacca). This is only the beginning. Very soon one gains the impression that Buddhism has a convenient list for everything: the three jewels, the five aggregates, the five precepts, the eight noble persons, the ten fetters, the ten unwholesome courses of action, and so on. It is apparent that much of the scriptural sutta material preserved in the four primary Nikayas can be regarded as exposition based around lists of one sort or another, and that very many suttas might be resolved into and summed up in terms of their component lists.
