RingZer0 Team created a site that hosts many different challenges such as reverse engineering, forensics, crypto, and many others. These challenges have helped me learn new tools and get exposure to low end parts of the computer. 

One of the challenges I completed required reversing a randsomware that encrypted a MBR. After the MBR has been retrieved it needs to be reversed to find the password to boot up the system. This taught me how to get around simple anti-reversing techinques and reversing 16bit code.
