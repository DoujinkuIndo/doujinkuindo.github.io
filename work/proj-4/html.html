<p>Inception is a minimal, professionally designed single page website template written in Foundation 6, and serves as the perfect home for a creative agency. The design was provided by the generous team over at <a href="http://webdonut.net" target="_blank">Web Donut</a>. Being that I’ve taken on Twitter’s Bootstrap and Bourbon’s Neat, I figured I’d might as well take on Foundation 6 by Zurb while in the grid framework spirit.
