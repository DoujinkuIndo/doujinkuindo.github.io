## <center>About Hacker Showcase</center>{: .acm-blue }

<center>This is a area to showcase all the projects that past and current UCLA students have built. 
We are hoping to foster a hacking community by sharing our experiences, and hopefully inspiring
the next generation of hackers. If you have a project you would like to showcase, contact acm hack!</center>
