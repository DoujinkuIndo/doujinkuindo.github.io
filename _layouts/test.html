<h1>Global Thinking Site Refresh</h1>
  <p>During the summer and fall semesters of 2014, I was employed as a co-op by Global Thinking, an awesome creative agency in Washington DC. My major project was to refresh the entire company site. I was the sole developer of this project working cooperatively with one of Global's designers and project managers. For comparison, the image below shows <a href="http://globalthinking.com">globalthinking.com</a> before the refresh:</p>

  <p>As I understand it, these “This is How We Built it” posts often span many categories:</p>

    <li><a href="#logo">Illustration, Graphics and Logo Design</a></li>
    <li><a href="#typography">Typography</a></li>
    <li><a href="#usability">Usability</a></li>

    <li><a href="#">Workflow and Optimization</a></li>
  </ol>

  <p>I'm going to attempt to cover these topics as best I remember. I haven’t touched the site in several months!</p>

  <p id="logo">The first thing you notice on the old GT site which you can visit by going <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140208233300/http://www.globalthinking.com/">here</a> is the illustrated logo and the sort of “in your face” images made possible by the skeuomorphism trend at the time. Global Thinking, a digital experience agency tends to stick with the current trends in design and development. Images on the new site are  still big and bold, but reserved at the same time. Images are now used to give each page a unique identifier. They give you insight as to what content follows. The GT box logo and all other illustration has been nixed to really give this site a modern and premium feel.</p>

  <p id="typography">Global Thinking wants visitors to actually read the content on the site. This starts with choosing fonts wisely. Without a graphical logo, the company name needs to be easily distinguished and identifiable. People remember images more than they do fonts. We decided to go with Oswald, a font not really meant for reading but rather looking cool. It almost looks stretched and elongated.</p>

  <p>Headings need to be big, bold, attractive, and catchy. We decided to go with Montserrat. Not to digress too heavily but the inspiration for the creation of Montserrat is quite interesting. Julieta Ulanovsky was inspired by "the old posters and signs in the traditional neighborhood of Buenos Aires called Montserrat." She wanted to "design a typeface that rescues the beauty of urban typography from the first half of the twentieth century."</p>

  <p>All content was written in Droid Serif. Sans fonts are technically more legible on the web and serif was created for print. Serif fonts however give you the feeling you’re reading print — we find that it really allows for content to be king.</p>

  <p id="usability">Making sites usable is much easier said than done. Their are several things to look out for: people with different sized devices, old or new browsers, colorblindness, screen readers, orientation, responsiveness, speed, the list goes on.. Usability concerns were the reason this site took so long to refresh! It was imperative for our users to easily be able to find what they were looking for on our site. It was imperative for them to be able to contact us, locate us, and learn about us. That is why our site is backwards compatible up to IE8 (that was rough), responsive and adaptive, fairly quick in speed given the large images and amount of content per page, and looks good in any orientation you please.</p>

  <p>Information architecture is fascinating. Wikipedia defines it as “the art and science of organizing and labelling websites, intranets, online communities and software to support usability and findability.” I never realized just how important this was until iterating over this site numerous times to get the best results from our testers. Your navigation bar should be easily accessible. Your next/previous buttons should give you an idea of where you’re going or what’s coming up. Your pages should also be as lean as possible, conveying only what is imperative. The old GT site suffered a bit from having too much trim. Personally when I initially applied for the job, I looked online like anyone would do to get more information and I couldn’t find much. I had a very rough idea of what they did, what they did for their clients, and who worked there.</p>

  <p id="advertising">As far as advertising and promotion, Global Thinking has never been big on that. Instead, this time around through use of case studies the new site goes through exactly what we did/do for most of our clients omitting fancy buzz words along the way.</p>
