I may review some of these in depth in future posts, but in the meantime, do get in touch if you have questions.\n\n####Online courses\n[Code Academy](http://www.codeacademy.com) (html, css, javascript, ruby tracks) - \nCheap and cheerful. A good forum if you get stuck and great for dipping your toe in the water. \n\n[Learn HTML and CSS From Scratch in 30 days](https://www.udemy.com/html5-css3-responsive/) - Fantastic course and highly recommended. It's very practical/hands-on and you will come out of this having hand-coded your very own responsive website.\n\n[One Month Rails](https://onemonthrails.com/) -  Again, highly recommended. You learn to create a Pinterest clone using Rails and Twitter Bootstrap. The downside is that as this is aimed at beginners, a lot of the technical detail is left out so it's not always clear why things work the way they do (sometimes referred to as [rails magic](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1927377)). The guys that run this course also produce an [excellent weekly news roundup](http://blog.onemonthrails.com/) of highlights from Hacker News.\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Feb/orails.jpg)\n\n[Learn Command Line the Hard Way](cli.learncodethehardway.org/book) & [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](ruby.learncodethehardway.org) -  Very popular free course series from Zen Shaw. Not always clear but hey, its free! Just do it. And do it again and again. Then do it a thousand times more (you’ll understand when you start).\n\n[Hartl Rails Tutorial](ruby.railstutorial.org) – Very popular among newbie learners. I ended up trying this again recently and have been more successful on the second attempt because I had gained a better understanding of basic ruby / rails concepts from other courses. I am halfway through at this stage and hoping to complete soon.\n\n[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) - I signed up for a free trial and did not continue because there was a lack of support for the version of Rails that I was using (think they had not got round to updating he course content). You might have better luck than me...\n\n####Other online resources\n[Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com) – Useful resource but I found I had to come back to this after I had completed some of the items above. This focuses on the mechanics of the ruby language and less on practical application.\n\n[Codewars](www.codewars.com) – Very new on my radar. You are presented with a number of challenges referred to as 'katas' (for some reason the programming community often pays homage to the martial arts) to solve and get levelled up as you progress. Looks great and I have completed some challenges but will hold fire until I have learned a bit more about test driven development (a method of writing code popular in the Ruby community).\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Feb/codewars.jpg)\n\n[Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io) - an online service that provides all the tools you need via the browser to build web apps. I found this useful because I only have a laptop with 11\" screen and could access everything from one window (e.g. command line, text editor etc).\n\n[Ideone](https://ideone.com) – a browser application that allows you to execute ruby code (good for trying out exercises listed in books below).\n\n####Books\n[Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=tobblo-21) (Russ Olsen) - Oh dear. Going to have to come back to this one!  I ended up parking this and starting on the next book below which is highly recommended if you are a beginner like me. Think this book is more suited to people coming from other programming languages or who are more grounded in computer science concepts.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=tobblo-21\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0321584104&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=GB&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=tobblo-21\" ></a><img src=\"http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=tobblo-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0321584104\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\n\n[Beginning Ruby: From Novice to Professional](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1430223634/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1430223634&linkCode=as2&tag=tobblo-21) (Peter Cooper).

It’s an insightful resource and comes from someone with experience in the trenches who has gone on to be successful in setting up a career as freelancer. \n\nAli's guide is tough-talking and he does not hold back on making it clear that making a successful career in this field is challenging. The jobs are out there but the knowledge and skills required is immense and constantly changing. He says continuous learning is key, and ultimately you will get out what you put in. I emailed Ali with a few follow-up questions and he was super-nice and helpful. \n\n\n###So there you have it...\n...A little about my learning journey to date, and hopefully, some useful links if you are looking to get into programming. \n\nMy first day at Makers Academy is tomorrow.

            "slug": "week1",
            "markdown": "# Orientation, getting to grips with the basics & crotch blow-out...\n\nHey everyone.\n\nWeek one is complete!\n\nIt's Saturday afternoon as I write this and I never been happier to sit on the couch!  My mind is buzzing, and at the same time, I'm feeling pretty tired. My first week at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) has been a good one and I'd thought I'd share some of the highlights...\n\n##Orientation\n\nThe February cohort of Makers Academy is made up of 22 students, a number of whom have travelled a long way to be here. One guy even crowd-funded his way onto the course. From what I can make out so far, there is a real mix in terms of backgrounds - some are straight out of Uni, others are career-switching. \n\nOur introduction to Makers Academy kicked off with some really useful advice from the teaching team. Having now graduated 100+ students they are at a point where they have some strong theories about how new students can make the most of their time during the twelve weeks. Quite simply, the most successful graduates:\n\n1) **Worked hard**. We should expect to do an additional 2-3 hours per day of study outside of class and...\n\n2) **Were confident**. Self-belief plays an important role. \n> 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right.' Henry Ford\n\n\nThese points have really struck a chord with me. Not once was it claimed that a background in computer science and a high IQ were essential prerequisites. Rather, the Makers Academy crew are keen to emphasise that it's more about a willingness to learn and adopting an [internal locus of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control). This attidude no doubt has relevance in all aspects of life, and is not just soley relevant to learning software development.\n\nWe were warned that it's normal to go through a bit of a 'slump' half way through the course as the intensity picks up. Openly crying at your desk has is normal, apparently!\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Feb/crying_cat_nb6376.jpg)\n\n\n##The learning begins\nWe were all armed with a MacBook Pro and desk space and hit the books...or in this case, the online course materials. Learning to code is going to take a lot of mental energy and so I'm particularly pleased that we have unlimited access to snacks and drinks (including beer!) from the well-supplied kitchen.\n\nTopics covered this week were [command line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), [version control](https://github.com/tretallick) and [ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) basics culminating in our [first project](https://github.com/tretallick/student-directory). There is a mix of lectures and self-directed learning, but the big emphasis is on peer learning and ultimately, peer programming. \n\nPeer programming (pairing with another person to code) is seen as a sure-fire way to quickly build programming skills and create good software. This point was emphasised by our first guest speaker [Sam Joseph](http://www.hpu.edu/CNCS/Faculty_Staff/CV/SamJoseph%20.html) from Hawai'i Pacific University. Pair programming, in his opinion is a multiplier in terms of skills development. **Start it early and do it often**. His advice to would-be programmers again echoes Makers Academy's own regarding *confidence* - the open source community is very welcoming and we should just get in there asap and start contributing. \n\n![](/content/images/2014/Feb/sam_joseph-1.jpg)\n\n\n##Health mind, healthy body...But mind your jeans.\n\nMakers Academy has its very own '*Chief of Joy*'.  Dana is there to look out for the well-being of students and as part of her role she holds daily meditation sessions. Feeling like I could do with a bit of time-out from coding, I went along happily to give it a go. I soon realised that my slim-fitting jeans were not cut out for sitting cross-legged (or even kneeling) on a mat. I spent those ten precious minutes worrying about a pending crotch blowout, rather than emptying my head of all thoughts.

            "html": "<h1 id=\"orientationgettingtogripswiththebasicscrotchblowout\">Orientation, getting to grips with the basics &amp; crotch blow-out...</h1>\n\n<p>Hey everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Week one is complete!</p>\n\n<p>It's Saturday afternoon as I write this and I never been happier to sit on the couch!  My mind is buzzing, and at the same time, I'm feeling pretty tired. My first week at <a href=\"http://www.makersacademy.com\">Makers Academy</a> has been a good one and I'd thought I'd share some of the highlights...</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"orientation\">Orientation</h2>\n\n<p>The February cohort of Makers Academy is made up of 22 students, a number of whom have travelled a long way to be here. One guy even crowd-funded his way onto the course. From what I can make out so far, there is a real mix in terms of backgrounds - some are straight out of Uni, others are career-switching. </p>\n\n<p>Our introduction to Makers Academy kicked off with some really useful advice from the teaching team. Having now graduated 100+ students they are at a point where they have some strong theories about how new students can make the most of their time during the twelve weeks. Quite simply, the most successful graduates:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Worked hard</strong>. We should expect to do an additional 2-3 hours per day of study outside of class and...</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Were confident</strong>. Self-belief plays an important role.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right.' Henry Ford</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These points have really struck a chord with me. Not once was it claimed that a background in computer science and a high IQ were essential prerequisites. Rather, the Makers Academy crew are keen to emphasise that it's more about a willingness to learn and adopting an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control\">internal locus of control</a>. This attidude no doubt has relevance in all aspects of life, and is not just soley relevant to learning software development.</p>\n\n<p>We were warned that it's normal to go through a bit of a 'slump' half way through the course as the intensity picks up. Openly crying at your desk has is normal, apparently!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/crying_cat_nb6376.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"thelearningbegins\">The learning begins</h2>\n\n<p>We were all armed with a MacBook Pro and desk space and hit the books...or in this case, the online course materials. Learning to code is going to take a lot of mental energy and so I'm particularly pleased that we have unlimited access to snacks and drinks (including beer!) from the well-supplied kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>Topics covered this week were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface\">command line</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tretallick\">version control</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">ruby language</a> basics culminating in our <a href=\"https://github.com/tretallick/student-directory\">first project</a>. There is a mix of lectures and self-directed learning, but the big emphasis is on peer learning and ultimately, peer programming. </p>\n\n<p>Peer programming (pairing with another person to code) is seen as a sure-fire way to quickly build programming skills and create good software. This point was emphasised by our first guest speaker <a href=\"http://www.hpu.edu/CNCS/Faculty_Staff/CV/SamJoseph%20.html\">Sam Joseph</a> from Hawai'i Pacific University. Pair programming, in his opinion is a multiplier in terms of skills development. <strong>Start it early and do it often</strong>. His advice to would-be programmers again echoes Makers Academy's own regarding <em>confidence</em> - the open source community is very welcoming and we should just get in there asap and start contributing. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/sam_joseph-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"healthmindhealthybodybutmindyourjeans\">Health mind, healthy body...But mind your jeans.</h2>\n\n<p>Makers Academy has its very own '<em>Chief of Joy</em>'.  Dana is there to look out for the well-being of students and as part of her role she holds daily meditation sessions. Feeling like I could do with a bit of time-out from coding, I went along happily to give it a go. I soon realised that my slim-fitting jeans were not cut out for sitting cross-legged (or even kneeling) on a mat. I spent those ten precious minutes worrying about a pending crotch blowout, rather than emptying my head of all thoughts. That said, I really appreciated the opportunity, and will continue to take up the offer, perhaps next time sporting a pair of jeggings.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Feb/blowout4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"thefirsttest\">The first test</h2>\n\n<p>The week ended with with a test on the command line. I went into it feeling prepared but quite nervous all the same. The test was challenging and a number of the questions were new territory, requiring some frantic googling. Pleased to say I passed though and now am the proud owner of the Unixoid sticker below.

These are coding problems that you do over and over again (mmm...origin of coding nightmare becoming more apparent) until they are etched into your subconscious and you can perform them without consciously thinking about them. \n\nAfter successfully completing Fizzbuzz (writing a programme that identifies multiples of three and five for a given range) I moved on to the more difficult [Roman Numerals](https://github.com/tretallick/roman_numerals) challenge, where I had to convert an arabic number to it's roman number equivalent. This was quite a jump for me, and I think many of the fellow students were in a similiar boat. What got my head scratching wasn't the identifying which [ruby method](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_methods.htm) to use, rather, it was thinking systematically and logically about the steps required to achieve the desired outcome. It made me realise that so much goes on when our brains take on a problem like this. It's easy to overlook the small, incremental but critical steps in the process because they are sometimes ingrained in our subconscious. \n\nI guess that's why humans and computers make a great partnership. Computers might have the mental muscle, but at the end of the day they (largely) can only do what we instruct them to do. The more we understand the problem, the easier it is to break it down into its component parts and theeasier is is identify the steps required to solve the problem. \n\n> \"In Okinawa, belt mean no need rope to hold up pants!\" Mr Miyagi, Karate Kid\n\nTo help us further develop our Ruby programming prowess, we were introduced to a great little learning resource called [Code Wars](www.codewars.com), which has literally hundreds of coding katas to try out. It even takes on aspects of [gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) and awards points and rank as you progress onto more difficult coding challenge. \n \n\n### Version control is awesome\n\nOk I said it. My one geek-out moment for this week. We finished the week with a test on Git (...I am still awaiting the results, fingers crossed). Git allows people to track changes in their their code and store their code online at [Github](www.github.com/tobyretallick). Provided the code is made public, other developers can download the code, make fixes or improvements and submit a request to the the original author to have their changes merged back to the original. What has got me so excited about Git and Github is the that soon I should have enough know-how to start contibuting to open source projects. \n\nSo, in all, an end to another good week at Makers. We've taken a step forward learning Ruby and puts some polish on our [Student Directory](https://github.com/tretallick/student_directory_pro) programme. Next week we get onto Object Orientated Programming. I also have a karate grading on Monday night which to be honest, is freaking me out a bit. It been hard to keep on top of training over the past couple of weeks. \n\nTime to revise some real katas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "markdown": "## So Rails, we meet again... ##\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Apr/boss.png)\n\nPrior to joining Makers Academy I had only a brief encounter with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), a framework for building apps using the Ruby programming language. [I built a Pinterest clone](http://pinternet.herokuapp.com/) following a paint-by-numbers-style course called One Month Rails. \n\nI finished the course. The app ran fine :-) \n\nBut, at the end of it, I was still scratching my head as to how this whole damn Rails thing actually worked. The One Month Rails course, although very good, often had to skirt over a lot of the detail. It was a *one month* course after all. \n\nRails, by its very nature aims to take a lot of the hard work out of web development and provides a raft of functional shortcuts that do a lot of work for you in the background. [Rails magic?](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1927377) Almost certainly. But I think the intention behind *Rails magic* is good, even if you do come out of the whole experience with even more questions.\n\nThankfully, a lot of my longstanding questions were answered this week. Alex, our current teacher/coach at Makers Academy took us through Rails from the ground up. Having had some experience the previous week building apps the slightly *harder* way using the Sinatra framework, things finally began to sink in. I don't think I ever could have got to this point studying on my own as I had being doing previously. We created a clone of Yelp, which included a typical sign up process and the ability for the user to add information about restaurants and add reviews. \n\nOk, it's still a little rough around the edges and all the restaurants have KFC avatars but it's a start huh.\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Apr/chicken.png)\n\n\n### What it really means to be agile...  ###\n\nWe had two great talks this week - one by Laurie Young, from [New Bamboo](http://new-bamboo.co.uk) and the other from Makers Academy Teacher and Dr of Code(?), Enrique.\n\nBoth shared their own views on what it really means to be *agile* when it comes to developing software. In my own experience, agile tended to be a buzzword that was used with abnormally high frequency at the various industry meetups I attended.

The app ran fine :-) </p>\n\n<p>But, at the end of it, I was still scratching my head as to how this whole damn Rails thing actually worked. The One Month Rails course, although very good, often had to skirt over a lot of the detail. It was a <em>one month</em> course after all. </p>\n\n<p>Rails, by its very nature aims to take a lot of the hard work out of web development and provides a raft of functional shortcuts that do a lot of work for you in the background. <a href=\"http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1927377\">Rails magic?</a> Almost certainly. But I think the intention behind <em>Rails magic</em> is good, even if you do come out of the whole experience with even more questions.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, a lot of my longstanding questions were answered this week. Alex, our current teacher/coach at Makers Academy took us through Rails from the ground up. Having had some experience the previous week building apps the slightly <em>harder</em> way using the Sinatra framework, things finally began to sink in. I don't think I ever could have got to this point studying on my own as I had being doing previously. We created a clone of Yelp, which included a typical sign up process and the ability for the user to add information about restaurants and add reviews. </p>\n\n<p>Ok, it's still a little rough around the edges and all the restaurants have KFC avatars but it's a start huh.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Apr/chicken.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatitreallymeanstobeagile\">What it really means to be agile...</h3>\n\n<p>We had two great talks this week - one by Laurie Young, from <a href=\"http://new-bamboo.co.uk\">New Bamboo</a> and the other from Makers Academy Teacher and Dr of Code(?), Enrique.</p>\n\n<p>Both shared their own views on what it really means to be <em>agile</em> when it comes to developing software. In my own experience, agile tended to be a buzzword that was used with abnormally high frequency at the various industry meetups I attended. What I realise now is that my experience with agile was pretty shallow up until this point. Sure, the agencies I commissioned adopted a number of agile practices - a few 'sprints' chucked in here and there. Maybe a regular morning standup meeting thrown for good measure. </p>\n\n<p>What I did not realise is that being agile is much more than that.

A surreal, enlightening, challenging and above all, amazing experience to say the least. \n\nThe time has gone so quickly. I started learning the basics of the Ruby Programming Language.

Every student has two weeks to complete a final project, with graduation and presentations all set for May 9th 2014.\n\n###Meet Chartist\nI have teamed up with four other amazing students ([Anna](https://github.com/yan0va), [Nat](https://github.com/itsmurasaki), [Mikhail](https://github.com/duboff) and [Mario](https://github.com/mariogintili), ) to build *Chartist* - an app that will allow people to quickly visualize and share simple data. Think of it as *Pinterest for charts*...\n\n> *Chartist* - for those who want to share simple data online, but don't have the time.\n\n### Kickoff\nHaving successfully commandeered the study room for the day, we set to work on planning the app. \n\nHere's what we did...\n\n#### Step 1: User stories\nWe had earlier defined in a broadest sense what we wanted the app to do (...allow those with no time to be able share their data online...). We then translated this 'big idea' into three short user stories. We plan to keep these visible on our whiteboard throughout the duration of the project and refer back to them to make sure we are on track.\n\n> 1.

As a user I want to be able to share my charts so that my information can get to those who need it.\n\n> 3. As a user I want to be be able to organise my charts into groups so that related information is in one place.\n\n#### Step 2: Prioritisation of features\nAfter brainstorming a list of suitable features Mikhail took us through a quick exercise to prioritise them. As this early stage in the project we were most interested in those features that were deemed as absolutely 'essential' - that is, the things the app must do at a bare minimum to achieve our vision (for anyone interested UX expert [David Travis has an excellent analogy on this topic](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/redroutes.html)). These were then ranked from 'easy' to 'hard' in terms of time & effort it would take to complete (of course these are only best guesses!).\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Apr/photo.jpg)\n\n#### Step 3: Simple wireframing\nAnna started sketching how these features might look on a live site. The great thing  about wireframing on a whiteboard, in my view, is is that it keeps your sketching basic, allowing you to focus on what is really important and not get too distracted by flashy artwork. Awesome artwork will come later I hope.\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Apr/photo-4.JPG)\n\n#### Step 4: Database Design\n\nFinally we sketched out a model for our database, and came up with what we felt would be the most efficient way to store and access a chart's information - its author, x values, y values, comments etc.\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Apr/databasemodel.JPG)\n\n\n### The work beings\nWe managed to start coding that same day. Working in pairs and using [test driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), we began building the database and the means to make a very simple chart, as well as creating a basic front end.\n\nMore updates to come over the coming fortnight.

But with the added simplicity comes a price - less customisation and functionality. Chartkick will do for now but we may end up exploring using Google Charts API directly if we need more functionality. In addition, Chartkick takes a fairly simple approach to documentation so it didn't end up being straight forward when it came to implementation.\n\nWe also have some work to do on embedding charts on other platforms. It's easy to generate a link to to a chart but as yet we have not yet been able to proide an image of the chart - for example, say you wanted to download a jpg of your fancy new chart. This is because the charts are rendered in javascript via our own API rather than html. \n\n### Feature-rama\n\nWe've already begun thinking about new and improved functionality that might be implemented over the coming days. Time permitting of course!\n\n- We defintely want to allow a user to manually enter data in the browser in order to create a chart. At the moment they can only do it by uploading a CSV file, making for a less than optimal experience for most people out there.\n- We are exploring a [voice api](http://Wit.ai) which may, just possibly, allow us to generate a chart using speech! \n- A great suggestion from Alex, one of our teachers...How about a Chrome extension whereby you can highlight some text (a simple stat), click on a button at the top of the browser and generate a graph automatically?\n\nBut of course, whilst implementing cool functionality may get us giddy with excitement, we won't be forgetting the not-as-exciting, yet absolutely essential tasks...\n\n...Like search bars.\n\nStay tuned...\n\n",

I am looking forward to getting a couple days' rest and spending time with my very pregnant partner (our baby boy arrives in only four weeks!). Then, come Monday the learning will continue.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone reading this is thinking about joining Makers and has questions, then do post them below or feel free to drop me a line.</p>\n\n<p>Speak soon!</p>",
