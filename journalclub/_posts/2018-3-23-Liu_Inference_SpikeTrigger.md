* Abstract

Neurons in sensory systems often pool inputs over arrays of presynaptic cells, giving rise to
functional subunits inside a neuron’s receptive field. The organization of these subunits
provides a signature of the neuron’s presynaptic functional connectivity and determines how
the neuron integrates sensory stimuli. Here we introduce the method of spike-triggered nonnegative
matrix factorization for detecting the layout of subunits within a neuron’s receptive
field. The method only requires the neuron’s spiking responses under finely structured
sensory stimulation and is therefore applicable to large populations of simultaneously
recorded neurons. Applied to recordings from ganglion cells in the salamander retina, the
method retrieves the receptive fields of presynaptic bipolar cells, as verified by simultaneous
bipolar and ganglion cell recordings. The identified subunit layouts allow improved predictions
of ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli and reveal shared bipolar cell input into
distinct types of ganglion cells.
