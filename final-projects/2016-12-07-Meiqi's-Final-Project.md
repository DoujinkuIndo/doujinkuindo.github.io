Abstract
After the American Civil War, it seems racial equality has been working remarkably smooth. However, racial equality has never been solved and racism has been played in the unspoken rule in nowadays the United States. You may have noticed that the majorities of the upper class in the society are white race, and on the contrary, the majorities of the under class are black race, or other colored races. Dr. Margaret Foegen Karsten from University of Wisconsin-Platteville had been comparing the Latino race with the White race in the workplace in the U.S., from all the aspects including their family backgrounds, education situations, marriage status, criminal records, and victim reports. In this article, I will be analyzing another but similar situation in the workplace, targeting African Americans. Comparing Latinos, African Americans have been treated more unevenly in the historical context, as well as nowadays. It is not just the color of the skins; it has culture background and lifestyles behind it.

Key words: African American, White, race, workplace, equality









Workplaces For African American Nowadays in the United States
Introduction
	Have you ever thought about what your life would be if you were not in the race you are in right now, and how would it have effects on your life? Racial differences and racism has become an unspoken rule in nowadays; although we had legal systems and laws to protect people from unevenly judgment based on their skin color, the workplace has still been divided into different pieces, stand for different races.
In May 2014, The Voting Rights Act, recently gutted by the Supreme Court, is a good example of a law against racism. Other laws against racism include the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission laws against racial discrimination in employment. 
Latinos V.S. Whites, replicated study based on Dr. Karsten’s study
Dr. Karsten has illustrated and analyzed the differences in the workplace for Latinas and White races in U.S. in her book Race, Ethnicity and Gender in the Workplace, she compared employment status of U.S. Latinas and White, Non-Latinas Aged 16 through 65; She collected Latinas employment data of Not in Labor Force as well as In Labor Force both unemployed and employed from Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central and South American, and Other Latinas; and then the author listed data of White, Non-Latinas to compare with previous data. From the result, the Total number and the percentage are nearly the same with the data of White, Non-Latinas; but if we break little pieces down, we can see that all the Not in Labor Force data are higher than White, Non-Latina, as well as the Unemployed data of In Labor Forces; on the contrary, Employed data are much lower than the White, Non-Latina employed data.  
Table 10.1 Employment Status of U.S. Latinas and White, Non-Latinas Aged 16 through 65

The author also collected data on different occupational group, in the book Table 10.2, the Occupation of Employed U.S. Latinas and White, Non-Latina Aged 16 through 65, the author listed data in Managerial and Professional, Technical, Sales, Administrative Support, Service Occupations, Precision Production/Craft, Operators/ Laborers/ Transport, Farming/Forestry/Fishing. From the data, we can see that jobs in the professional and academic areas have White people in higher percentages where Latinas are in the lower percentages; and blue-collar jobs such as operators, laborers, and transports, Latinas have higher percentages.

The author also included the education situation when comparing the difference of the job market between Latinos and Whites. Table 10.3 shows that based on the data from Table 10.2, Latinos are tend to have less higher education than the white people, thus influences on the employment in the further situations.

Author also listed Average Hourly Wages And Gender Wage Gaps Of U.S. Full-Time Latino Employees Aged 16 Through 65, By Sex And Immigration Statues. Table 10.8 shows that (in hourly wage): a.) Male employees make more than female employees; b.) Latinos born in the U.S. make more money than the Latinos from outside the U.S.; c.) Latinos before 1988 make more money than the Latinos after 1988.

African American V.S. Whites
Although American Civil War has become the milestone of human liberty in the United States, the racism has never been eliminated. In nowadays the United States job market, White people are still leading the upper classes jobs whereas Black people are tend to work as blue-collars. 
You have to ask “Why” in this situation, and the answer has to be multiple – there are many aspects in the situation that led it became what we see today. Despise the historical facts – about black people being slaves before the American Civil War -First, Black children and teenagers have higher drop-out rates than the White children, the ratio could be 3:1, which means, less Black children have chances to earn certain degrees like White children and teenagers do; the research by scholars who study the urban under class, indicated that just because of the education facts that black race population are less likely to have higher educations like white race does and it has long term influence on generations, thus causes lower educational group would be working as blue-collars. 
Second, the average marriage ages for black people are earlier than white people and other colored races, as well as the fertility age – the study by the scholars Christophor Jencks who studies races indicated that expected births before age 20 per 100 women, 80% black women would have birth before their 20 years old whereas white women only have 40%, the ratio is 2:1, which indicated that black women are having heavier duties by looking after children other than just working.
Why this situation continually happening in 21st century?  
Scholar Joleen Kirschenman and Kathryn M. Neckerman had mentioned in their article, “We’d love to hire them, but…” indicated that in general, black people are tend to be less responsible for their work duties, rude attitudes and more complicated backgrounds. The data was also collected from Murderers and criminals; it turns out during year 1950 to 1987, the ratio of white and black people being murders are 1:11; and the number increase progressively every decade. Thus, when a company decided to hire people, they would not prefer to hire black people due to the security and reputation of their company. 
Two hundred years slavery was a long time, long enough to build up a culture among races, history is too hard to ignore, what happened in the past would have long term influence on us no matter how hard we try. People cannot ignore the influence those 200 years have brought to this world, and people cannot ignore the culture that was built during that time. Racial equality has a heavy burden and embark on a long road to go, but even if we cannot see it, it would come eventually.
