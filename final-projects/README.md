Here is where you put your final project files. If you are submitting multiple files, create a folder. Give both folders and files names that are meaningful and that distinguish your project from others - i.e., do not name your file "final project.md". 

Remember to indicate who all worked on the project. You may submit URLs to blog posts, videos, etc. You may also post links to Box or Dropbox if you need to get around GitHub's file size limits.

Final Projects are due December 7, 2016.
