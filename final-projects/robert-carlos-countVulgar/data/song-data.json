Now do you believe in rock and roll, can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow?  Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues  I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died  I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' \"This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die\"  Now for ten years we've been on our own, and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******"

So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how Another body laying cold in the gutter. Listen to me.  Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all  But I think you're moving too fast.  Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation But he just can't see. She give him loving that his body can't handle But all he can say is, \"Baby, it's good to me.\" One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror But he doesn't recognize his own face. His health is fading and he doesn't know why.  Three letters took him to his final resting place. Y'all don't hear me. ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******"

"I didn't hear what you were saying I live on raw emotion baby I answer questions never maybe And I'm not kind if you betray me So who the hell are you to say 'we'? I never would have made it baby  If you needed love, well then ask for love Could have given love, now I'm taking love And it's not my fault, 'cause you both deserve What's coming now, so don't say a word  Wake up call Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed Don't you care about me anymore? Don't you care about me? I don't think so  Six foot tall Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead He won't come around here anymore Come around here? I don't think so  Would've bled to make you happy You didn't need to treat me that way And now you beat me at my own game ...  ******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******"
