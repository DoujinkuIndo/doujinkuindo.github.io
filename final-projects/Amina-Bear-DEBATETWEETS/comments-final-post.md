The video submitted uses debate techniques used by both cadidates that visually reflects the tweets posted by each of them.
Most tweets, unfortunately, bring in a negative overall sentiment level, which argues, why has politics shifted towards 
bashing and negatively influencing the people rather than educated political strategies and positive thinking? Could these
trends shift our society as we know it? Well, the video and the data speaks for itself.

Topic: Campaigning for U.S. president. 
Question: What's the ratio of tweets that reflect pessimism compared to all other tweets amongst candidates?
Significance: Hostility, poor policy, poor campaigning, threats to democracy.
Conclusion: Although the results slightly favor Hillary as being less pessimistic, the overbearing conclusion is that both
candidates have employed a pessimistic viewpoint that has negative connotation in a significant amount of their tweets.
This viewpoint is a reflection of how society will act towards eachother, and it's shameful that so much slander and negative
commentary is written by our presidential candidates, especially Donald Trump, our new president-elect.
