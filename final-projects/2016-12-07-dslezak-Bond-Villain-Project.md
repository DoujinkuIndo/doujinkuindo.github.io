  The world has dramatically changed in the past half century. One of the central changes from the 1960s to the present has been the Civil Rights Movement. It has been over half a century since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. But there has been some press about low amounts of speaking time for minorities such as the “Every Single Word Spoken by a Person of Color” video series. This has led to interest in seeing if there has been improvement in the roles and speaking times of minorities. Additionally, villains and henchmen are often an afterthought, sometimes a villain can steal a show like Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. But most often it is the hero who gets the attention and accolade. The James Bond series starts from the 1960s and is still currently being produced. Further, in each of the movies there is a villain with henchmen, by observing how the roles and speaking times of villains and henchmen changes from the beginning of Bond to the last two Bond films, it will show how the world’s view of them changed. In the four Bond films that will be analyzed all the villains are white, so to observe how minorities roles have changed, the speaking times of white and minority henchmen will be analyzed. 
  
  The data for this project involved recording the speaking times of villains and henchmen for the first two Bond films, Dr. No and From Russia with Love, and for the two most current films, Skyfall and Spectre. For the recording process a definition for villain, henchmen, and speaking had to be determined. Villains were defined as anyone who created the primary evil or malicious plan as well as playing the role of the main antagonist to Bond. For three of the films the creator of the evil plan and main antagonist was the same person but in From Russia with Love, the creator of the plan and primary antagonist were not the same person, the speech time for the villain was made into the speaking times of the two characters instead of the one in the other three films.
  
  For recording speaking times of henchmen, the definition of anyone who helps further the villain’s plot by receiving orders from the villain, and they must not be manipulated into doing the action was used. For example, in From Russia with Love, Tatiana was not included as a henchman. Tatiana was not labeled into being a henchman because she was manipulated by Colonel Rosa Klebb into tricking Bond by saying that Tatiana would be doing it for Russia instead of for Spectre. Additionally, henchmen who switched sides were not included in the henchmen data. The reason for not including henchmen who switched is because it is difficult to find the exact moment that the character switches sides, is it when they like Bond or when they take action by defending Bond? To not deal with the confusion of when sides were switched, the switchers were excluded from the speech timer all together.
  
  Speaking was defined whenever words were said. The main exclusions were grunts, laughs, and screams. The reason that only dialogue was used in the recording of speaking times was because dialogue held more weight than noises. It would have been difficult to balance out the weight of words vs. noises. During speech, there are natural pauses, if the speaker in the movie does not speak within five seconds of his last word than the timer was paused, if the speaker says something within three seconds then it is considered natural speech and the timer is not stopped. This played a role in the more modern Bond movies where there was more intensity and emotion in the speeches that the villains gave such as Raoul Silva’s [monologue]( https://youtu.be/C0dFsAtAlEo?t=16) on rats in Skyfall.
  
  There were three categories for speaking time: villains, white henchmen, and minority henchman. The reason for these categories was to observe the contrast between the villain's role and the henchmen's role as well as to see if there was a difference between the roles of white and minority henchmen. Between the first two Bond films and the two most current films, there were major changes in the civil rights movement which could have been reflected in the change in speaking times for minorities. 
  
  To differentiate between white and minority henchmen the United States Census Bureau definition of race was used, where white is defined as “a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.” If they did not fit that definition of white, then they were considered a minority actor. Some problems were encountered when attempting to find the race of actors in the first two Bond films, specifically some of the minor henchmen. When information on the race of an older actor was not found than an educated guess was used, the guess was based on appearance, accent, and any information found on the internet about them. 
  
  The speaking time for villains, henchmen, and minority henchman was broken down into three categories. The first one was the speaking time for each group in seconds because in some of the movies some of the groups had minimal speaking time so seconds allowed for all the times to have the same units. The next category was a percentage of speaking times for each group based on the total run time of the film. Older Bond movies were shorter than the modern ones. The four films are had different run times, the first two Bond films had similar time but Skyfall and Spectre varied, so by allowing for a percentage to be taken the speaking times were normalized. The last category was a percentage of speaking times compared to the total speaking times for villains and henchmen combined. The run time differences might have been due to various variables such as time period or budget, even after adjustment for inflation each of the four Bond films had an increase in budget, but the total villain and henchmen time should not change unless there was a change in how villains and henchmen are perceived. This allowed for a different normalization on the speaking times that did not depend on the run time. 
  
  The results were as follows: 

Dr. No: 
Time: V = 197s; WH = 116s; MH = 183s; 
Villain Speaking Percentage: V = 40%; WH = 23%; MH = 37%
Total Speaking Percentage: V = 2.74%; WH = 1.61%; MH = 2.5%; T = 6.85%

From Russia with Love:
Time: V = 248s; WH = 366s; MH = 24s; 
Villain Speaking Percentage: V = 39%; WH = 57%; MH = 0.04%
Total Speaking Percentage: V = 3.5%; WH = 5.2%; MH = 0.34%; T = 9.04%

Skyfall: 
Time: V = 451s; WH = 8s; MH = 6s; 
Villain Speaking Percentage: V = 97%; WH = 0.02%; MH = 0.01%
Total Speaking Percentage: V = 5.3%; WH = 0.09%; MH = 0.07%; T = 5.46%

Spectre: 
Time: V = 367s; WH = 244s; MH = 134s; 
Villain Speaking Percentage: V = 49%; WH = 33%; MH = 18%
Total Speaking Percentage: V = 3.8%; WH = 2.5%; MH = 1.4%; T = 7.70%


Where V stands for villain, WH stands for white henchmen, MH stands for minority henchmen, and T stands for total. From the data gathered there was no real pattern. The two most similar films in terms of villain and henchmen speaking time are Dr. No and Spectre, which is the first film and the most current film. The main difference would be that Dr. No has a larger minority henchmen speaking percentage over white henchmen while Spectre has a larger white henchmen speaking percentage. When comparing the first two to each other and comparing the last two to each other, the data is even worse for example the Skyfall villain takes up 97% of the total villain and henchmen speaking time. Then, when comparing Dr. No and From Russia with Love they are opposites in terms of white henchmen and minority henchmen speaking percentage, but From Russia with Love has a large range and has a larger total speaking time. 

  There were no major changes in the film team between the first two movies and the no major changes between the last two movies. A screen writer was added to From Russia with Love and the rest of the film team from Dr. No stayed. Then, in Spectre they added a writer and the rest of the crew stayed the same. These changes most likely had minimal impact on the villain and henchmen speaking times. The main change between the Dr. No/From Russia with Love and Skyfall/Spectre were that the first two films were based largely off Ian Flemings work but the two most current films used a very small portion of Ian Flemings work so it was largely new fiction. This could have caused the major change in villain and henchmen speaking times in the two new Bond films. 

  The largest percentage of total and villain speaking time for minority henchmen occurred during the film Dr. No. The Screen Actors Guild or SAG started in 1930s it was a union for actors and originally it had some difficultly because high ranking actors didn’t want to join. In the 1970s the SAG opened two new committees one focused on women and the other on minorities. This could explain as to why the first Bond film had such a large amount of minority henchmen, if the white actors were in a union then by hiring minority actors some could save some money. The budgets for the four Bond films analyzed go from the lowest budget to the highest by following the chronological order of the films, this is after inflation adjustment. So, if they wanted to spend the least amount of the budget on the henchmen then they would hire minorities which are not as well represented by the union in the 1960s. But one year after Dr. No came out a new Bond film, From Russia with Love, came out and from the data it had the second least amount of minority henchmen. The difference between the two films is that there was a difference of eight million dollars between the two films after inflation adjustment. Because they had less money for Dr. No, they had to hire the worker with less union representation. Additionally, in the year From Russia with Love cameout, SAG added an "American Clause" which disallowed discrimination.
  
  Along with minorities, women got a new SAG committee. The data originally was not looking at women but after the committee discovery a simple quantitative analysis was done on the number of women in the two Bond films before the committee and after. In Dr. No and From Russia with Love, there were more women villains than in Skyfall and Spectre. But the change could also be due to the sound of the human voice, a male voice sounds more villainous than a female voice. Dr. Shanahan and Dr. Huron found that in opera the heroes have a higher pitch voice than the villains (Shanahan & Huron, 2014). Opera is different from movies but they both are an acting medium that have a hero and villain. Though opera does involve singing over speaking, and the analysis focused on the singing so for speaking roles it might change. Additionally, for there was study on animals which also showed that more aggressive animals had lower pitched voices while the more docile ones had higher pitched voices (Morton, 1977,1994). This would lead to less women getting villainous roles because they could not replicate the voice characteristics of villains.
  
  Bond villains and henchmen reflect what the publics fear was during the time period. For example, From Russia with Love was based in the middle of the Cold War. Then, Skyfall and Spectre villains and henchman reflected the fear of terrorism and cyber-security/surveillance. This reflection of current fears would also affect speaking times for the villains and henchmen. If the fears are of cybersecurity and cybersurveillance then the communication between heroes and villains could occur over a [computer](https://richardmorrison.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/skyfall-concept-screens-2.jpg) instead of face to face.
  
  This section will be an analysis on two similar scenes from the two Bond movies periods analyzed. The older Bond movie will be From Russia with Love and the newer Bond movie will be Spectre. Both scenes are on a train with Bond and his lady companion. A henchman who has been stalking Bond silently throughout the movie appears on the train, attacks and is defeated by Bond but the scenes both take different approaches. Both scenes take to form to what is currently a fear to society. From Russia with Love was set during the Cold War and Spectre is set during a time where terrorism is a fear. In From Russia with Love, Grant starts off by slowly observing Bond and when he finally finds a moment, he uses discretion and manipulation to put himself into a better position. Then Bond and Grant play a [game](https://youtu.be/CidOZOzHKn8?t=22) of chess as Grant tries to hide the fact that he is not on Bond’s side while Bond tries to find out if he is really Nash. They stand off like the Cold War until Nash makes his move with sleeping pill, Bond doesn’t fall for it and they have a fight in their booth. Then in Spectre, the camera shows a [champagne glass](https://youtu.be/BeATSA3TM2g?t=134) for a split second which shows Mr. Hinx barreling down the dining cart and attacking Bond, like a terrorist attack where a glimpse is seen and then chaos. The fight in From Russia with Love occurs inside the booth while the fight in Spectre occurs directly in the dining car, like how the Cold War occurred behind closed doors and terrorism occurs in plain sight. 
  
  The results from the data were not conclusive. The problem was that there were a lot of variables to the speaking time of villains and henchmen. There were some changes with the writers and screen players but they were minor. Though the change between the two-time periods could be due to the change from Ian Flemings work to mostly original content in the newer films. The change in minority and women roles as villains and henchmen could have been due to better union rules that occurred after Dr. No and From Russia with Love were made. Another possibility is that women don’t fit the vocal characteristics of a villain. Additionally, it was observed that villains and henchmen roles are reflected in the fears of the public during the period, and it can be seen in the train scene comparisons.
