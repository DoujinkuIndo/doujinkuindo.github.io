#### Tech stack
Spring boot, Angular2.

#### Project description
Our concept introduces a whole new way of lending and spending. 
Wouldn’t the idea of interest feel more attractive if a friend, sibling or loved one benefitted from sharing money with you? 
Providing its users with a platform for establishing private small scale collaborative economies, TEEM may just revolutionize the way you view money.

##### What is TEEM?
We have created a concept that represents our view on how sharing economy can be adapted into the banking industry. TEEM will provide users with the ability to take small loans amongst themselves with no administrative noise. It is meant to personalize loaning and encourage members to invest in each other, while removing the usually more corporate aspect of borrowing and investing money.

##### TEEM aspects
* DNBonus – Loyalty Program
* TEEM – Personal Loaning Groups
* TEEM – DNB Loaning Group

##### Product
We have created both a desktop and mobile (Android) prototype to demonstrate our product. Additionally, we have created a framework for receiving and holding DNBonus points. Mainly, we have focused on the TEEM functionality, the private loaning groups (phase two) as we find this sufficient for demonstrating the TEEM concept.
Ideally, TEEM should be directly connected to the user’s bank account. However, since we have no way of implementing this, we have provided our users with an imaginary bank account for the sake of demonstration. The balance of this account is displayed in the user’s “Money”-field.
