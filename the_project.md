In this study, We at the Gosnell Research Group (GRG) are trying to determine the nature of an x-ray emission found in the rich open cluster NGC 6819. In the original [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012ApJ...745...57G/abstract) that was the catalyst for this study, Gosnell et al. classify an emission from NGC 6819 they call "X1" as a "possible qLMXB," or quiescent low-mass x-ray binary, which is a binary systm that features a neutron star with a detached accretion and a star less massive than the neutron star. These types of binary systems are predicted to happen relatively rarely in rich open clusters based on studies of denser globular clusters; lower mass in open clusters means that they don't have enough gravity to hold on to a neutron star after supernova, since in the most common type of supernova the leftover hunk of neutrons is given a kick of a couple hundred km/s, well over the singular digit escape velocity of the cluster. However, theoreticians have come up with ways that a qLMXB might form through "dynamical interactions" that don't give the neutron star such a high velcoity after supernova. If we confirm the existence of a qLMXB in NGC 6819, it shows that dynamical interactions play a larger role in the formation of open clusters than we thought and can help us better model the conditions under which these groups of gravitationally bound stars form.
