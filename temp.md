title:  Building OpenCV 4 with Java Support
excerpt: The following 'how-to' explains how to build the latest version of OpenCV (4.2+) with its Java bindings on Linux and macOS‚Ä¶
---

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org) is a powerfull open source Computer Vision library written mainly in C++. Today, the most common way to use OpenCV from Java is to use its Java bindings. Technically, those bindings rely on the traditional JNI approach.

OpenCV offers 'official' distributions for [Windows, iOS and Android](https://opencv.org/releases/) but none for Linux and macOS. In addition, it's not even clear if the Windows distribution includes the Java bindings.

This _'how-to'_ explains how to build the latest version of OpenCV (4.2+) with its Java JNI bindings on Linux and macOS. The [latest Java version](https://jdk.java.net), 14 at the time of writing, is used as all the OpenCV Java material seems to be stuck on Java 8 (and OpenCV 3). The latest and greatest OpenCV and Java versions are used but this obviously work using different versions. Producing builds on Windows is just a matter of properly installing and configuring the native toolchain, and configure the respective Java paths.

[Panama](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/) is an OpenJDK project whose goal is to improve and enrich the connections between the JVM and well-defined ‚Äúforeign‚Äù, i.e. non-Java APIs. Panama is under active development, its current focus is on C but C++ support should be added later. It will then be worthwhile to revisit this and to switch to use Panama's approach instead of the old JNI approach.

Building OpenCV and the Java binding process is straight forward but takes time. The bulk of the time is spent in building natively OpenCV for the target platform, then the Java bindings will be built for that same platform. To do this, we need a native C++ toolchain (`g++`, `ld`, `make`, ‚Ä¶) and a Java toolchain, i.e. a JDK and a recent version of Apache Ant. 

### Install the native C++ toolchain

Unless you are using a stripped down Linux distribution, most of the native tools are probably already available (ex. `ld`, `nm`, `objcopy`, `objdump`, `make`, etc.). On a fresh Ubuntu, I only had to install `g++` and `cmake`. Optionally and given that there are over 300 options to build OpenCV, using a configuration front-end such as `ccmake` or `cmake-gui` can be helpful. Note that Python is also required for the build phase.

```
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install cmake-curses-gui
``` 
On macOS, you will need to have XCode installed.

### Install the Java toolchain

Install the JDK ‚Ä¶

```
wget https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk14/076bab302c7b4508975440c56f6cc26a/36/GPL/openjdk-14_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
gzip -d openjdk-14_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm
sudo cp -r jdk-14/ /usr/lib/jvm/
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-14/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-14/bin/javac" 1
```
‚Ä¶ and Apache Ant.

```
sudo snap install ant --classic
```

### Configure the build

```
mkdir workspace;cd workspace
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
mkdir build
```

Create the build files using `ccmake` and pointing it to the OpenCV codebase directory and to the newly created build directory.

```
ccmake -S opencv/ -B build/
```

Alternatively, you can use `cmake-gui` which offers a GUI. And simillarly, you should specify the OpenCV codebase location and the directory where it should be build.

Both `ccmake` and `cmake-gui` works the same way. You first need to hit "C" (configure) to scan your envorinoment, this will scan your environment and configure related entries (ex. compilers location, JDK location, supported hardware extensions, ‚Ä¶). Then and if required, you can manually configure some entries, just make sure to press "T" to toggle the advanced mode. Once done, you should press "G" to generate the Makfile.

Most of settings should be fine by default. The following entries should be configured for Java support.

* `JAVA_AWT_INCLUDE_PATH`

‚Ü™ Linux `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-14/include/`

‚Ü™ macOS `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-14.jdk/Contents/Home/include/`

* `JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY`

‚Ü™ Linux `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-14/lib/libjawt.so`

‚Ü™ macOS `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-14.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/libawt.dylib`

* `JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH`

‚Ü™ Linux `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-14/include/`

‚Ü™ macOS `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-14.jdk/Contents/Home/include/`

* `JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2`

‚Ü™ Linux `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-14/include/linux/`

‚Ü™ macOS `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-14.jdk/Contents/Home/include/darwin/`

* `JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY`

‚Ü™ Linux `/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-14/lib/server/libjvm.so`

‚Ü™ macOS `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-14.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/server/libjvm.dylib`

üí° Building OpenCV takes time, anywhere between 5 minutes and +60 minutes depending on your configuration, the selected OpenCV modules, ‚Ä¶; so it's a good idea to first do a minimal build to check that eveything is OK.

Disabling the entries below will reduce the build time from ~50 minutes to ~6 minutes (YMMV!). Once your build process is OK, you can selectevely re-enable the features you plan to use. And realistically, you will need additional modules to unleash the power of OpenCV.

 * BUILD_IPP_IW

 * BUILD_ITT

 * BUILD_OPENEXR
 
 * BUILD_PERF_TESTS

 * BUILD_TESTS

 * BUILD_TIFF

 * BUILD_WEBP

 * BUILD_opencv_calib3d

 * BUILD_opencv_dnn

 * BUILD_opencv_features2d

 * BUILD_opencv_flann

 * BUILD_opencv_gapi

 * BUILD_opencv_highgui

 * BUILD_opencv_ml

 * BUILD_opencv_objdetect

 * BUILD_opencv_photo

 * BUILD_opencv_python_bindings_generator

 * BUILD_opencv_python_tests

 * BUILD_opencv_stitching

 * BUILD_opencv_ts

 * BUILD_opencv_video

 * BUILD_opencv_videoio

 * VIDEOIO_ENABLE_PLUGINS

 * VIDEOIO_ENABLE_STRICT_PLUGIN_CHECK

The following OpenCV modules are the bare minimum to use OpenCV from Java.

* `BUILD_opencv_core`

* `BUILD_opencv_imgcodecs`

* `BUILD_opencv_imgproc`

* `BUILD_opencv_java_bindings_gen`

Once you are your have configured the entries, just press "G" to generate the Makefile.

### Build OpenCV

```cmake --build build/``` or ```make --directory=build/```

To use OpenCV from Java, you need the `build/bin/opencv-430.jar` jar and the native libraries located in `build/lib`.
 
The basic [Test](https://gist.github.com/delabassee/1ba380e1f32d20f2c518b1e6c6b080eb) class converts a picture from the default BGR colorspace to gray.

```
javac -cp build/bin/opencv-430.jar Test.java
java -Djava.library.path=build/lib/ -cp build/bin/opencv-430.jar:. Test
```
 
```java
import org.opencv.core.*;
import org.opencv.imgcodecs.Imgcodecs;
import org.opencv.imgproc.Imgproc;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.loadLibrary(Core.NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME);

        String info = "Java " + System.getProperty("java.version") + " "
                + Core.NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME + Core.VERSION_STATUS;
        System.out.println(info);

        var srcImage = Imgcodecs.imread("duke.png");
        Imgproc.cvtColor(srcImage, srcImage, Imgproc.COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
        Imgcodecs.imwrite("grey_duke.png", srcImage);

        var width = srcImage.cols();
        var height = srcImage.rows();
        System.out.println("Image size : " + width + " X " + height + " pixels.");

    }
}
```
