## FAQ
### Registration

{: .question}
**Can you describe the overall registration process for schools and other organizations?**

{: .answer}
Each organization submits one registration form. The form allows each organization to register up to 5 teams of 6 students each. The organization will be asked to designate a coach that will receive communications from MCAMC, as well as provide basic information about each student participating. If your school or organization would like to register more than 5 teams, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at [mcamathleague@gmail.com](mailto:mcamathleague@gmail.com). 

{: .question}
**Can I register as individual without a team?**  

{: .answer}
Yes! If your school is not participating in MCAMC, you can register as individual. On the day of the competition, you will be matched with a team, and you will be able to participate in all rounds just like everyone else. However, if your school is participating in MCAMC, please register with your school.

{: .question}
**Our school contains grade 5 and/or grade 9. Can these students participate?**  

{: .answer}
Grade 9 students *may not* participate. Students grade 5 and under *may* participate, but the questions on the competition assume a middle school level understanding of mathematics. Younger students may find this competition too difficult.

{: .question}
**Can organizations other than schools form teams?**  

{: .answer}
Yes! Any team from anywhere may participate. However, if a student's school is participating in MCAMC, then the student should register with their school.

### Day of the Competition

{: .question}
**What should I bring?**  

{: .answer}
Just a writing utensil is good! We will provide scrap paper and anything else you might need. Calculators, protractors, and other aids are not permitted. We will regularly announce the time, but if you wish, a (non-smart) watch is also permitted.

{: .question}
**Can parents and teachers stay?**  

{: .answer}
Due to space limitations, up to 1 adult per team can stay. We encourage at least 1 adult per organization/school to stay. 

{: .question}
**Where is parking? Where is the drop-off location?**  

{: .answer}
Our school is located at 100 Technology Drive, Edison, NJ. Refering to [this map](https://www.middlesexcc.edu/campus-map/) of Middlesex County College, our high school is building AC, located on the western side of campus. Parking is available in Lots 1 and 2 (not 1B). If you are not parking, students may be dropped off directly in front of our school (building AC). For reference, our building has a tall American flag in front.

### Payment

{: .question}
**What does the overall payment process look like?**  

{: .answer}
In the registration form, the school, organization, or individual will have the ability to preorder pizza and T-shirts. You can expect an email within one buisness day of registration containing the total amount owed. Payment (cash or check made out to TODO) or a guarantee of payment must be mailed to 100 Technology Drive, Edison, NJ 08837 and *received* by the indicated deadline. We will send another email when we recieve your payment or guarantee of payment. We do not accept online payments at this time. If you have any questions, please contact us at [mcamathleague@gmail.com](mailto:mcamathleague@gmail.com).

{: .question}
**How much does MCAMC cost? Can I pay at the door?**  

{: .answer}
MCAMC costs $10 per student. Payment at the door will not be accepted. Payment must be *received* by mail by the indicated deadline.

{: .question}
**What dining options are available?**  

{: .answer}
Pizza can be preordered at $12 per 18-inch pie. If you do not wish to eat pizza, the College Center ([building CC on this map](https://www.middlesexcc.edu/campus-map/)) has a food court. Prices at the food court range from $5 to $10 per person. *Students must be accompanied by an adult if leaving designated competition areas. We will not be responsible for students who travel to the College Center or other such locations. Please take care to not get lost and return in a timely fashion. By registering for MCAMC, the organization coach or student parent agrees to these terms.*

{: .question}
**Are there T-shirts?**  

{: .answer}
Yes! T-shirts are available for $12. You can check out this year's design [here](TODO). T-shirts must be preordered when registering and will not be sold the day of the competition.

### Miscellaneous

{: .question}
**Does a high score on the MCAMC guarantee admission to Middlesex County Academy?**

No, our competition is not affiliated with the admissions process of our school. However, our admissions team is well aware of the rigor and importance of math competitions in general, including but not limited to the MCAMC. We encourage those who enjoy math competions to apply!
