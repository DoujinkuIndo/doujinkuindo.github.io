## Webscraping HDB BTO application info in R

I did some webscraping on HDB BTO application rates! The post is up [here].(https://clemwgk.github.io/bto-analysis/)

The files used for the post are listed below, and can be found [here](https://github.com/clemwgk/clemwgk.github.io/tree/master/2020-09-webscraping-bto).
* webscraping-bto-info - 17 09 20.R. This is the R script used
* The other files are png files produced by the script. I use the small versions for the post, otherwise the size gets a bit overbearing
