## Webscraping HDB BTO application info in R

I did some webscraping on HDB BTO application rates! The post is up here.

These are the files used for the post.
* webscraping-bto-v2 - 16 09 20.R. This is the R script used
* The other files are png files produced by the script. I use the small versions for the post, otherwise the size gets a bit overbearing.
