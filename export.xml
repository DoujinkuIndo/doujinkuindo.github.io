&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pridefulsloth.com/&quot;&gt;Prideful Sloth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/580200/Yonder_The_Cloud_Catcher_Chronicles/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/games/yonder-the-cloud-catcher-chronicles/cid=UP1243-CUSA08242_00-YONDERCCUS000000&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $19.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles was recently released by Prideful Sloth on Steam and the PS4. It’s an open world game where you’re tasked with saving Gemea, an island paradise slowly being consumed by Murk. I was able to get a copy for review a bit before the game came out and have put a fair amount of time into it, completing its story and many of the quests the game provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Yonder, you play customized character that’s been shipwrecked on Gemea. Right off the bat, you meet a Sprite who helps you through a brief tutorial about movement, item collecting, and Murk-busting. After that, you’re left to your own devices but directed to the closest town. From there you’ll learn more about gathering items, basic crafting, and will eventually build your first farm. At any point in the game, you can go off exploring, visiting one of the 8 different environments Gemea has to offer. Each environment has its own trees, flowers, and seasonal changes. You’ll build farms, befriend wildlife, join crafting guilds, help people in need. You’ll also collect Sprites that will help you disperse pockets of Murk throughout the land, unlocking more secrets, treasures, and paths to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re out exploring you can also continue to customize your character with new hairdos, hair colors, clothing, and accessories. Most of these items you can even craft yourself. Need help managing your farm (animal poop builds up fast) whip up some tasty food and use it to hire farmhands to do all the heavy lifting for you. Need some shortcuts across the map? Build bridges, or unlock the secrets of the 8 Sage Stones to warp yourself from area to area. Want to sit around and fish all day? Yup. You can do that, too. There’s even a bunch of easter eggs and a hidden city of not-so-pleasant inhabitants to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yonder/secret.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Secret&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Found this easter egg early on while trying to take a shortcut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course can also follow the storyline, which is basically just an overblown tutorial for many of the game’s features. It’s short, simple, and can be accomplished without seeing 90% of what Yonder has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yonder is a beautiful game, filled with lush environments, bright colors, and lively inhabitants. The soundtrack is soothing, non-invasive, and fills out Gemea as you wander around, doing as you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has Groffles, one of the cutest in-game animals I’ve ever seen. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yonder/screens.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most impressive visuals in Yonder is the night sky. Sometimes while you’re exploring you’ll find constellation stones. Each one you find will cause that constellation to flare up in brilliant blues in the night sky. Find them all and you’ll be playing under an amazing glowing sky that makes you wish it’s always night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the core Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is very simple, there’s just way more content than I could get into in a review. I’ve been a few weeks playing the game for several hours every night, and I’ve still got a few more quests to complete. The game is a blast to play, and I keep telling myself I’ll “just craft a few more items” every time I play. While I’m absolutely in love with the game, it does have a few pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the story is too short, light on plot, and is a bit anti-climactic. Like I stated earlier, you can complete it without seeing 90% of what the game has to offer. There are whole areas of Gemea you could miss, along with most of the crafting guilds. The best part of the story is that it unlocks another town with people to interact with once it’s complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next issue is with the crafting system. Just about every crafting tree you get has a few items needed that can’t be made. Mortar, for example, is needed for just about every Construction recipe. You need it to make Keystones, which are needed in a lot of larger stone object. You then need MORE of it when it comes time to craft those items. You can only get Mortar my trading for it from people in towns. The problem is there’s never enough. Not only that, but it doesn’t seem to restock with any particular person on a regular basis. This makes it tough to craft a lot of Construction projects, and there’s a lot of bridges to be built throughout the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken this up with Prideful Sloth, and they’ve assured me that items like this will be taken care of in weekly patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, I can’t recommend Yonder enough. It’s one of those games where, even though there’s no real point to farming, trading, fishing, etc…, it just feels great doing all those things. I’m always working on making my farms better, planting new trees over the island, cooking all the different kinds of food, and tailoring my own fashions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of action, Yonder might not be for you. If you love making stuff, this isn’t one to pass up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Siren Miniatures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sirenminiatures.com/&quot;&gt;Siren Miniatures&lt;/a&gt; sent over a few of their newly released minis for us to take a look at. Located in Warsaw, this small creative workshop in Poland makes some really great miniatures. The models they produce are highly unique, stylized, and of very high quality. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrought with personality and imagination, these 32mm scale models are cast in premium-quality resin and generally fall into one of five genres: dwarf, elf, human, frogger, or moon child. Each model comes in plastic blister with its appropriate flat plastic 30mm base. Additionally, each model is sold unpainted and requires assembly. I definitely need to find a few quiet weekend moments to paint these bad-boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siren Miniatures offers free shipping if you spend 50€ (about $60).  The minis arrive packaged pretty much how you would expect if you have ever purchased a mini in the last 20 years. The parts are loosely placed in a plastic container with some foam padding. Unnerving a first, but resin is a hardy material and generally speaking, minis are rarely damaged during shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sirenminiatures/sm1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Siren Miniatures 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sirenminiatures/sm2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Siren Miniatures 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once assembled, these minis look great! The level of detail and texture makes these minis primed for painting. These minis’ distinctive features drastically change the dynamics of any game table. Each unique character is donned in unusual armor and wielding stylized weaponry. For the price, they are a great buy—each mini will run you about $13 or so.  Because all components of these minis are resin, prepping, gluing, and painting are easy.  Check these guys out, it is worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Lovecraft Letter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lovecraftletter/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lovecraft Letter&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Seiji Kanai &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alderac.com&quot;&gt;AEG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 5-15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 10+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; No&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/198740/lovecraft-letter&quot;&gt;Lovecraft Letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seiji Kanai’s Love Letter made waves when it first arrived in 2012. The game packed a lot of fun into just 16 cards, leading a micro-game revolution. Since then AEG has put out a bunch of different games using the Love Letter engine, Lovecraft Letter being the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time you’re not vying for the affection of a princess. This time you’re fighting off madness and trying to eliminate your rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lovecraftletter/mi-go.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mi-Go&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;The basics of Lovecraft Letter are simple. At the start of the game, each player is given a card. On each player’s turn, they must draw a card and discard a card, resolving the text on the discarded card. Play continues until all players are knocked out except one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different cards have different effects. Some knock players out of the game immediately if played. Some protect a player from other players targeting them until their next turn. Some have you compare hands with other players for varying results. It’s up to the players to best use the abilities to be the last one standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cards, however, also have green text on them. If discarded they go in front of the player to indicate the player has gone insane. The card’s normal text is resolved. The real change comes during the player’s next turn. Before they draw their card, they must pass a Sanity Check by flipping over as many cards from the deck as they have insanity cards discarded in front of them. If any card with green text turns up, they’re knocked out. If not, they play their turn as normal, using green text on cards when available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last player left in a round of Lovecraft Letter gets a token. The type of token they get is determined by whether or not they’re sane at the end of the round. A player wins the game by earning 2 Sanity Tokens, or 3 Insanity Tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovecraft Letter is certainly a deluxe game compared to the normal release of Love Letter. The game comes in a box that looks like a book and has a magnetic clasp to keep the box shut. The insert inside the box perfectly fits the tarot-sized cards and Sanity/Insanity Tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the cards, they’re thick and contain wonderful artwork filled with Lovecraftian horrors. .AEG also includes sleeves for all the cards, plus a few extras, in the box. There are sleeves featuring the card backs for the 25 game cards, and clear sleeves for the 6 reference cards. A nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love Letter is an excellent game on its own. Lovecraft Letter elevates it with the Insanity mechanic and almost turns it into a completely different experience. There are some excellent card combinations available to try force other players out of a round, and plenty of risk/reward for taking the Insanity approach to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovecraft Letter is the best incarnation of Love Letter yet, a certainly a game to pick up for Love Letter fans or those who are interested in Love Letter and don’t know which version to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t see playing any other version of the game now that Lovecraft Letter is in my collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Lovecraft Letter was provided free for review by AEG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>All Your Favorite Indie Character Fight it Out in Bounty Battle</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Screen Games is currently running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fig.co/campaigns/bounty-battle?media_id=728#about&quot;&gt;fig campaign&lt;/a&gt; for Bounty Battle, a 2D fighting game that features over 30 characters. 20 of those characters are taken from your favorite indie game worlds with the following studios partnering with Dark Screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bountybattle/heroes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Heroes&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Airship Syndicate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Awfully Nice Studios&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;D-Pad Studio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinkbox Studios&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eneme Entertainment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interabang entertainment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interceptor Games  Martelo Nero  MobGe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Okobu Games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Hook Studios&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ronimo Games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swing Swing Submarine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thar Be Monsters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thunder Lotus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thomas Happ Games LLC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too Kind Studio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tribute Games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vlambeer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White Rabbit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect to see favorites from games like Darkest Dungeon, Awesomenauts, Guacamelee, Flinthook, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bounty Battle isn’t just a straight forward fighting game, though. Players must manage resources, such as their life and energy, to earn Bounty Points. These can be used to create new actions and also hire minions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the game looks amazing. It’s currently in an alpha phase, fully feature-complete, but still needing bug fixes. The fig campaign has a little over 30 days left with 29% of the $30,000 goal met. Dark Screem’s goal is to get the game on as many platforms as possible with a Q4 2018 release date.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yu-Gi-Oh! Legendary Dragon Decks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yu-gi-oh/Holiday_Box_2017_Mock.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Legendary Dragon Decks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Konami’s Yu-Gi-Oh! special holiday release this year, &lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Legendary Dragon Decks&lt;/em&gt;, arrives on October 6th. The set will contain 153 cards, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two 40-card Decks with 11-card Extra Decks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One 41-card Deck with a 10-card Extra Deck&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 foil cards in each deck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three decks, &lt;strong&gt;Legendary Dragons of Atlantis&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Cyber Dragons&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Dimensional Dragons&lt;/strong&gt;, are ready to play out of the box. Of course you can mix and match the cards to create your own creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s Konami’s descriptions of each deck:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legendary Dragons of Atlantis!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The powers of the Legendary Dragons of Atlantis – Timaeus, Critias, and Hermos – were sealed into Spell Cards, used by Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey to fight against Dartz and The Seal of Orichalcos! The Eye of Timaeus, The Fang of Critias, and The Claw of Hermos are well-loved by Duelists everywhere for their ability to Fusion Summon a wide variety of unique monsters using only one material! All 3 Spells and all of their Fusions are included in this Deck inspired by Yugi’s final Duel against Dartz, as is a brand-new Fusion Monster born of The Eye of Timaeus and Yugi’s famed Dark Magician!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Dragons!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many Duelists consider Cyber Dragon to be the most influential monster ever created, so it’s only natural that it’s earned the title of “legendary!” Cyber Dragon originally debuted in 2005’s Cybernetic Revolution along with 2 Fusion Monster forms Summoned by combining multiple Cyber Dragons together. Eleven years later in Breakers of Shadow, Cyber Dragon Infinity shocked the Dueling world with its incredible power and became a household name. This Deck is packed with the best that Cyber Dragon and its many Fusion and Xyz Monster forms have to offer along with a brand-new Fusion Monster!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimensional Dragons!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V’s Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon sparked a series of Dragons that covered the entire spectrum of Extra Deck monster types, and threw in a Ritual Monster for good measure. Adaptability is the defining feature of the “Odd-Eyes” strategy, starting from Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon’s dual nature as a way to search other Pendulum Monsters from your Deck and a way to end Duels in a flash with its double-damage ability. This Deck fills the final gap in the “Odd-Eyes” arsenal with a brand new “Odd-Eyes” Pendulum Monster!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Children of the Zodiarcs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/childrenofthezodiarcs/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Children of the Zodiarcs&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cardboard-utopia.com/children-of-zodiarcs/&quot;&gt;Cardboard Utopia&lt;/a&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://na.square-enix.com/us/home&quot;&gt;Square Enix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/436290/Children_of_Zodiarcs/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, PS4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $19.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1314680699/children-of-zodiarcs-a-new-tactical-jrpg-by-aaa-ve&quot;&gt;Kickstarter for Children of the Zodiarcs&lt;/a&gt; I felt a mixture of excitement and skepticism. Who wouldn’t be after the dumpster fire the Unsung Story Kickstarter has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. Different companies. Different campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention I was also a backer of Might No. 9? At least we finally got that one, but look at the shape it came out in…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no need to fear any longer. Cardboard Utopia delivered on their promise, releasing Children of the Zodiarcs with Square-Enix as their publisher. For those unfamiliar with the title, it’s a tactical RPG with deck building and dice crafting elements. It releases on Steam on July 18th and I’ve been lucky enough to have a press copy for a little over a month to put the game through its paces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children of the Zodiarcs plays very similarly to other tactical RPGs. You have a team of characters, each with their own special abilities, on a gridded map. Battles are turn based, the facing of your characters matters, and the elevation of your character, as well as if they’re attacking someone from the front, side, or back, affects the damage you do. Some maps require you to defeat all enemies to proceed, while others have objectives to meet, or just require you to survive a set number of rounds. There’s a world map with battles that move the story forward, open battles to help you grind, and tons of secrets and side quests to keep even fans of Final Fantasy Tactics happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/childrenofthezodiarcs/characters.png&quot; alt=&quot;Children of the Zodiarcs Characters&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Where the game differs from most tactical RPGs is the card and dice mechanics. Instead of a set list of actions, or a learnable set of abilities, each character has a deck of cards that dictate what they can do. Each turn you’ll have a hand of cards to choose from, or you can take a turn to draw two more cards to your hand up to a max of 7. There’s no magic points, job points, casting times, etc… You can play a card from your hand and it instantly resolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the card mechanic is a dice mechanic that replaces your standard “% chance to hit.” For every card that’s played you roll a set of dice to determine the card’s outcome. There are symbols for hit, defense, magic, special abilities, etc… The more of a symbol you roll, the better the effect. This might seem a bit random, but there’s more. There’s also a dice crafting mechanism to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you level up, win battles, etc… you’ll earn new cards, level up current cards, earn new die sets, and unlock dice slots for your characters. The cards are utilized in an in-game deck builder so you can customize your character’s actions based on the cards they have. The dice crafting mechanism is a bit different. The more dice slots you have unlocked, the more die sets you can hold. Different sets of dice have different chances of rolling certain symbols. The higher the set level, the better chance of a positive outcome. The more dice slots a character has, the more dice sets they can hold for varied results. You’ll even get a chance in the game to create your own fully custom dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/childrenofthezodiarcs/diceandcards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Children of the Zodiarcs Characters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children of the Zodiarcs combines wonderfully colorful and detailed 3D characters and environments with wonderfully illustrated character portraits, world maps, and 2D cutscenes. The voice acting is top notch and everything is accented with a soundtrack worthy of listening to on its own. The whole package feels like a lot of care was put into every detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get straight to business right off the bat. Children of the Zodiarcs is amazing, and one of the best tactical RPGs in a long time. It combines a lot of what has made its predecessors successful with new and fresh mechanics that actually add to the gameplay rather than feel tacked on for the sake of being a gimmick. The story is engaging with characters that you grow to love/hate as you follow them throughout the progression of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The card and dice mechanics, while seemingly a bit random at first, add a level of depth and customization to the game that’s both satisfying and rewarding. Choosing the right cards for the right situation and pairing them with the best die sets to maximize their effectiveness feels like a game in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6c18mgFfMA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of tactical RPGs there no reason for you to skip out on Children of the Zodiarcs. It’s accessible for new players and provides plenty of depth and customization for veterans of the genre. It’s no Final Fantasy Tactics, but as we’ve seen time and time again, nothing is. You can rest assured that your $20 will be well spent and that you’ll be challenged and entertained for more hours than you’ll probably care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Steam key for Children of the Zodiarcs was provided free for review by Square Enix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Monopoly Gamer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/monopolygamer/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monopoly Gamer&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boardgame community collectively lost its mind when Hasbro and Nintendo pretty much dropped Monopoly Gamer in stores without much warning. Of course, everyone’s reactions weren’t overwhelmingly &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; as Monopoly has a bit of reputation among hobby gamers. Then again, plenty of people were going out of their way to snag the Collector’s Edition of the game and all the extra characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently available in Gamestop stores, Monopoly Gamer will hit the general public in the fall. The Collector’s Edition, which features an extra character, Bowser, plastic coins, and a box insert that can hold all the extra figures, will remain a Gamestop Exclusive. The retail edition doesn’t include Bowser, has cardboard coins, and a fairly plain box insert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monopoly Gamer Figures Packs let you expand your game with new characters from the world of Mario. Each costs $4 and contains the figure, character card, and a sticker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monopoly gamer plays a lot like the Monopoly most people already know how to play. There are a few changes, though, some of which aren’t minor. First, and most important, is the winning condition. The player who has the most points when all the Boss Cards have been defeated is the winner. More about Boss Cards in a bit. Points are earned by how many coins a player has, their properties, and any Bosses they defeated. Run out of coins? You’re not out of the game, just a bit out of luck. Sell a property or just try to grab some coins off the board. There’s no bankruptcy to knock you out of the game in Monopoly Gamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the next change. There’s no paper money in Monopoly Gamer. Instead, players get coins in denominations of 1 and 5. Costs of properties range from 1-5 coins, while property rents max out at 10. Coins also can be dropped, and picked up, off the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board also sees some major changes. There’s no Chance or Community Chest cards. There’s no Utilities or Railroads. Each color only has two properties, and there are warp pipes that allow you to race across the board, question marks to give you extra coins, Thowmps to knock coins from your, and Special Stars to activate character’s special powers. Have both properties of a color? You gain more rent when other players land on one, but there’s no houses or hotels to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major aspect of Monopoly has always been its trademark pieces (even though they recently went through a bit of a change.) Monopoly Gamer swaps out metal tokens for plastic figures. Mario, Peach, Yoshi, and Donkey Kong come with the retail set, each with their own Character Card that explains their abilities. Every character has two: a special ability and a bonus ability. Special abilities are activated when a player lands on a Special Star. Bonus abilities give you a bonus to a roll on the special die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about a good a time as any to talk about the dice in Monopoly Gamer. There’s 2 of them, a movement die and a special die. Each turn both are rolled and the player decides in what order to resolve them. The movement die controls how many spaces you move across the board. The special die has icons that activate different powers. A green turtle shell makes the player in front of you drop 2 coins. A POW block makes everyone drop 1. There are 6 different icons in all, and each can be given a bonus by a different character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are bosses. Every time a player passes go they grab 2 coins and flip a Boss Card over from the pile. They can choose to pay the cost to fight the boss or pass the option to fight it to the next player. Fighting a boss is a single die roll where you need to roll equal or greater than the number listed on the card. Win, and resolve the winning condition and earn a number of points on the card. Lose, and pass the chance to fight the boss to the next player. The boss will continue to move from player to player until defeated, or all players pass. Once all the bosses are defeated the game is over and points are scored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board in Monopoly Gamer is full of just about every location you can think of from the Mario World. It’s also filled with warp pipes, Thwomps, question blocks, and Special Stars. Monopoly staples like the Go space, Jail, Free Parking, and Go to Jail are still here. The artwork is colorful and familiar to fans of the Mario series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/monopolygamer/pieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monopoly Gamer Pieces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cardboard of the board is pretty standard Monopoly fare. The coins are not an overly thick cardboard, but not flimsy either. The cards are glossy and have a nice thickness to them making them feel like they could stand up to multiple plays without much wear. The dice are oversized, with a good heft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real draw in Monopoly Gamer is the figures. They’re plastic, highly detailed, and have an excellent paint job. They feel great to pick up, move around the board, and would also look great just sitting on a collector’s shelf. The ability to snag more in the Figure Packs is a huge plus, adding the ability to snag Toad, Luigi, Rosalina, Wario, Boo, Fire Mario, Diddy Kong, and Tanooki Mario to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I’m not much of a Monopoly fan. The games to me feels repetitive, takes way too long, and is way too heavy on the luck. While Monopoly Gamer still features a good amount of luck, it’s streamlined to the point where a game takes less than an hour. That, combined with special powers of each character, and the wacky Mario Kart like antics of the special die, make the game a surprisingly fun time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monopoly Gamer is a version of Monopoly I can gladly play with my kids, have a goofy time knocking coins from other players and snagging them up, fight bosses, and have the game end in a time before I want to pull my hair out in frustration. I don’t think I’ve played a game so far that went over 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit surprised, but I really do enjoy the game. I’m actually hoping we see more of these streamlined versions of the game come out with more collectible figures. Zelda, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecticon 2017 - Geek Fever Games</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/geekfever/pollyanna.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pollyanna!&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Geek Fever Games had an impressive showing at Connecticon this year with three tables full of games. The first was dominated by their upcoming game with Thundergryph games, Dead Man’s Doubloons, designed by Jason Miceli. The latest prototype was available to play, which included the Alternate Island that was unlocked as a stretch goal in their Kickstarter campaign. Jason also had a bit of a surprise for me (pictured to the right), knowing how much of a fan I am of Dead Man’s Doubloon’s Pollyanna. She spent the rest of Connecticon making sure I was safe and offered to destroy anyone who got in my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next table contained Darrin Horbal’s designs: Guardians of AsunDur, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Khroma-Zones-Review/&quot;&gt;KhromaZones&lt;/a&gt;, and his latest design, Rocket Ship Go. I was already familiar with the first two but got a chance to play an updated ruleset of AsunDur that streamlines the game further, making it set up quicker and offering an easier way to change the difficulty level of the game. I also got a few games in of Rocket Ship Go, a micro game where you’re trying to be the last player who can make a move on a board that rapidly fills up with mines. The game plays in less than 10 minutes and can be a real brain burner as you try to figure out how to lock out your opponent while not backing yourself into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/geekfever/rocketshipgo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rocket Ship Go&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least, was a table filled with
Tim Mierzejewski designs. One of my favorite games, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekfevergames.com/avoid-the-void.html&quot;&gt;Avoid the Void&lt;/a&gt;, was available to play with a few changes to streamline the game and make it more accessible. I finally got a chance to try Druid Dice, a battle game where players create a grid of dice that activate their Druid’s powers in a bid to get the most gems and/or totems. Tim also had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/ice-fortress&quot;&gt;Ice Fortress&lt;/a&gt; on display, a game that he entered into The Game Crafter’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/contests/big-box-challenge&quot;&gt;Big Box Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and is currently a finalist. The game is a cooperative tower defense game where players are working together to build a magical fortress and protect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all Geek Fever has a lot going for it. Their current lineup is nothing to scoff at, and I can’t wait for the games to be available in retail!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Dead by Daylight</title>

&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/cid=UP3509-CUSA08444_00-DEADBYDAYLIGHT00?smcid=pdc:us-en:pdc-games-detail-dead-by-daylight-ps4:leadproductinfo-buy-download:dead-by-daylight:up3509-cusa08444_00-deadbydaylight00:emcid_null&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/dead-by-daylight-special-edition/c0n22p73qz60&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $29.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where 4 players are trying to survive the night with a horror movie serial killer trying to do them in a number of terrifying and graphic ways. It’s been available on the PC since 2016, with console versions having been released in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dead by Daylight, you can choose to play as either a Survivor or a Killer. Survivors play in 3rd person and must escape a procedurally generated killing ground before the Killer gets them. They can work together to try and complete objectives and stall the killer, or they can be selfish, trying to get other players killed so they can survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Killer, on the other hand, plays from a 1st person point of view, has a variety of tricks up their sleeve, and must keep all the Survivors from escaping. Each Killer has their own set of special abilities to kill and torture Survivors. Killers can also sacrifice Survivors for extra points by picking them up and carrying them to special areas throughout each level. This takes longer but has much better rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the play, every Survivor and Killer has a tree of skills that can be upgraded with experience points gained from playing matches. There’s also equipment that can be unlocked that can give each side an extra edge when it comes to surviving or hunting/killing. Sometimes it’s a first-aid kit or flashlight. Other times it’s a totem that boosts a Killer’s abilities. You can even get different outfits, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it all boils down to is a giant game of hide-and-seek with unlockable upgrades that help you either hide or seek better the next time you play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead by Daylight is dark, gritty, and horrific. Pretty much what you’d expect from a top tier horror movie. The soundtrack is eerie and disquieting, while the sound effects are enough to make the hair stand up on the back of your neck and send electricity down your spine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhXXU0efIEQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horror games are really not my thing. I’m not a huge fan of the horror genre at all, be it games or movies. That being said, there was something about Dead by Daylight that really caught my interest when I first heard about it. Having given the game a try, I really like it. The asymmetrical gameplay between Survivor and Killer is a really nice touch, and each side plays completely differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said the same still scares the crap out of me, especially when I’m playing as a Survivor. The anxiety it gives me is &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt;. Playing as the Killer, while a bit less terrifying, still comes with its own set of stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While overall Dead by Daylight is a solid game, it still has its issues. There have been a few glitches I’ve come across here and there, but nothing overly game breaking. Matchmaking isn’t the greatest, and sometimes I’d be placed in a game with players much higher level than myself. Sometimes as a Killer I’m placed with a group of Survivors that have such good equipment they can pretty much do whatever they please and I’m helpless to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part? The community. It’s absolutely &lt;strong&gt;toxic&lt;/strong&gt;. A quick google search for “Dead by Daylight toxic community” will bring up pages and pages of complaints and stories of the horrible treatment players experience while playing the game. Of course, there are ways to avoid it, and it’s best that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At $30, the game is a pretty good value. It’s multiplayer only, but that’s nothing new in this day and age. If you can get past the salty community and minor technical hiccups, Dead by Daylight is a great game to get the blood pumping. If you’re not a fan of horror, though, steer clear. While I enjoy the game, I don’t know if I’ll be playing it much more unless it’s the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A North American PS4 key for Dead by Daylight was provided free for review by Starbreeze Studios.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Netflix Original Castlevania (Mostly Spoiler Free)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first heard that Netflix was going to air a Castlevania series I was both overly excited and fearful. As one of my favorite video game series of all time I really wanted to see Castlevania done justice, but didn’t have high hopes that anyone could really pull it off. Once Netflix released their first trailer for the show, my hopes rose a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iIMrFnl5NiA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fans of the video games, Castlevania focuses on the story of Castlevania III, with some extra lore tossed in that was first provided in Symphony of the Night. Trevor Belmont, the first Belmont to actually fight Dracula, is the central character along with Sypha Belnades and Alucard, Dracula’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with the games, the Belmonts are a line of vampire hunters dedicated to taking down Dracula whenever he pops up. Sypha is witch tasked by the church to help hunt down Dracula in Wallachia during Castlevania III’s time period. Alucard, Adrian Fahrenheit Ţepeş, is the son of Dracula and a mortal woman who doesn’t agree with his father’s methods and helps the others in their quest. In the game, there’s also a 4th member of the team, Grant, who was once a thrall of Dracula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix’s series takes a slightly different approach with each character, and it works better for the story. We don’t get to see Grant yet, but he’s sure to come in later. I won’t spoil any of the show here, but each character’s backgrounds and motivations are a bit different in the show, allowing a bit more depth, character growth, and overall tension to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castlevania takes place in the Romanian region of Wallachia, and Season 1 mostly focuses on the cities of Târgoviște and Gresit. After a short prelude, we find Wallachia under siege by Dracula’s armies. The prelude is done exceedingly well and sets the entire tone of what’s to come and why. We’re then introduced to Trevor, in a rather comedic way, and follow him from a small village tavern to Gresit, where she finds himself getting tangled up in things. Through a series of events he meets Sypha, deals with a bit of business, and the two find Alucard in a season finale that comes way too soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show is dark, extremely violent, and contains a coherent story you really wouldn’t expect from a video game adaptation. The voice acting is spot on and the animation detailed and gritty, though sometimes a bit halting. My only real complaint is the soundtrack. The Castlevania series is known for having some &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; great music. The show’s music, while not terrible, doesn’t live up to what’s come before it and falls a bit flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castlevania is available for streaming now on Netflix and Season 1 contains 4 roughly 30-minute episodes. You read that right. 4. The season passes by in a blink, but sets the series up in the right direction and leaves off in a perfect spot. Season 2 has already been picked up and it’s been confirmed that it will be 8 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we’ll have to wait another year before we get to see those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final verdict? Castlevania does an excellent job of bringing some fan favorites to life with a story that pays a great tribute to the original while keeping it fresh and interesting. The choice to go with Castlevania III as the source material is perfect, and tossing in the material from Symphony of the Night gives the series a perfect setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say this again. The series is &lt;em&gt;graphic&lt;/em&gt;. Tons of foul language and extreme gore. It’s not one for kiddos, and not really for those with a weak stomach. I can normally handle that stuff pretty well and there were a few spots were I found myself cringing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Beasts of Battle</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sensibleobject/beasts-of-balance-new-edition-and-battles-expansio/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Beasts-of-Balance-Review/&quot;&gt;Beasts of Balance review&lt;/a&gt; back in June I mention that the game really needed some kind of competative mode. Well, a new Kickstarter has been launched today by Sensible Object for a Battle expansion along with some new creatures to add to the game. You can also snag a new edition of the base game that comes in slightly smaller packaging, yet with room for all the expansion content in it. Everything else in the new edition is identical to the original base game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battles Expanison Pack adds 16 NFC Battle Cards and a Legendary Dragon. It allows 2-3 players to choose a single region: land, sea, or air, and battle it out by playing creatures of your type and stealing power from other regions. The NFC Battle Cards add in special powers that will help you attack, defend, and more during your battles. The Dragon, Magmaaargh The Cantankerous, can add a ton of points to your region, but constantly needs to be fed Star Points or things could get ugly for you. He can also be crossed with other creatures to create some truely horrific hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The More Beasts Expansion Pack adds a flamingo, chameleon, and angler fish. Each of these new creatures are a bit weirder shape than usual and can be be used to create over 100 new hybrids in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get both expansions with a pledge of $49 (retail will be $79.) The Kickstarer is already funded, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sensibleobject/beasts-of-balance-new-edition-and-battles-expansio#&quot;&gt;get your pledges in&lt;/a&gt; now to take advantage of the savings!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecticon 2017 - Yanaguana Games</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year was the first year Connecticon actually had booths available for tabletop publishers. In previous years companies could demo in the open gaming area, but never really had a reserved space or real “official” presence. One of those companies who had a booth this year was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yanaguanagames.com&quot;&gt;Yanaguana Games&lt;/a&gt;, a Rhode Island-based game company and publisher of Stir-Fry Eighteen and Shipload o’Gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/re-chord/re-chord.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Re-Chord&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Yanaguana’s Marshall Britt was demoing his new game, Re-Chord, a guitar themed area control game hitting Kickstarter at the end of the summer. I actually had a chance to play the game for the first time this year at CT-FIG, but it has further been refined as Marshall gets it ready for the Kickstarter campaign. Play revolves around placing guitar picks of different colors on a fretboard, trying to form chords and get the most of your color on each fret. Each color pick has a different ability that lets you manipulate other picks on the board. Players can score even more points by playing the same chord as a previously played one for a Re-Chord score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fantastic and original game that feels fresh and is tons of fun. I’ll have a full preview of the game ready for when it hits Kickstarer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yomi Characters to be Brought to Life in Fantasy Strike</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sirlin Games is well known in the tabletop world for Yomi and Puzzle Strike, among other games. Now their popular characters are coming the PC and consoles in Fantasy Strike, a 2D fighting game designed with simple controls and precision/timing-based gamplay. Currently they’re working to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fig.co/campaigns/fantasy-strike&quot;&gt;crowdfund the game&lt;/a&gt; on fig, hoping to raise $500,000. Backers at the Deluxe level will actually be able to play an Early Access version of the game on Steam as soon as their campaign ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantasy Strike is being developed to be accessible to newcomers to fighting games, as well as longtime fans of the genre. “Controlling your character is simpler than in just about any other fighting game,” says David Sirlin, President of Sirlin Games. “We don’t have joystick motions-we don’t even have CROUCH. The difficulty all comes from deciding what to do and when to do it. We’re very interested in gameplay depth, we just want it to come from your decisions. That approach has allowed us to draw in a much wider audience at trade shows than would usually be interested in a fighting game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Sirlin is actively working to fundraise for the game, development has already started for Steam and the PS4 and has been for about 2 years already. The game is expected to launch late 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Herbaceous</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/herbaceous/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Herbaceous&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Eduardo Baraf, Steve Finn, Keith Matejka &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pencilfirstgames.com/herbaceous/&quot;&gt;Pencil First Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $24.99&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 15-20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/195314/herbaceous&quot;&gt;Herbaceous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herbaceous is a card game about potting herbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It raised $59,032 from 2,208 on Kickstarter last year. Its goal was $6,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did Eduardo Baraf of Pencil First Games land here when he teamed up with Steve Finn to bring Herbaceous to market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Herbaceous is to score the post points by potting various herbs in your containers. Each player has a set of 4 different Container Cards and a Garden Marker. These are used to set up their play space. The 72 Herb Cards are then shuffled to form a draw deck, a certain amount of Herbs are removed from the deck depending on the number of players, and the Herb Biscuit card is set off to the side. Once this is done, the game is ready to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn players may pot Herbs, then must plant new ones. The only exception to this is that Herbs cannot be potted on the first round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s cover planting first. To do this a player draws an Herb Card from the deck and decides to play it either to their Private Garden behind their Garden Marker or to the Common Garden in the center of the table. They then draw another Herb Card and plant in the garden they didn’t plant the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potting Herbs is the way you’re going to score points in Herbaceous. At the start of their turn, a player may pot Herbs in one of their 4 containers. Once a container has been potted it cannot be added to. It’s out of the game until scoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4 pots are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large Pot - Holds 1-7 cards of &lt;em&gt;identical&lt;/em&gt; Herbs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wooden Planter - Holds 1-7 &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; Herbs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small Pots - Holds 1-6 &lt;em&gt;different pairs&lt;/em&gt; of Herbs for a total of 12 cards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Glass Jar - Any 3 Herbs. This is the only container that can hold Special Herbs (Herbs marked with a 1, 2, or 3 on their card)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game ends when no player can pot any more Herbs. They’ve either filled all their Containers or can’t make a valid potting. Points are then scored via the rules on the pots. Extra points are scored for Special Herbs in the Glass Jar and the Herb Biscuit is earned by the player who pots a 1, 2, and 3 in the Glass Jar for an additional 5 points. Players also score 1 point for every unpotted card in their Private Garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herbaceous comes in a wonderfully colorful and sturdy box. The card stock is pretty standard fare and the cardboard Garden Markers, while not super chunky, are thick enough to feel sturdy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Herbaceous really shines is  Beth Sobel’s lovely artwork. Every card features full-card, vivid paintings of various herbs, pots, and, of course, the biscuit. The game is a visual treat, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/herbaceous/cards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Herbaceous&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Just look at that art!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, Herbaceous looks like it’d be a bit boring. Who’s really that interested in potting herbs? As soon as start to play it all falls into place and you realize how beautiful and really elegant a game it is. The rulebook is crystal clear, the rules simple to teach and learn, and the gameplay offers just enough to be interesting while not being bogged down with complicated exceptions/fiddly bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herbaceous is a wonderfully light filler game that is just an overall satisfying experience to play. The beautiful artwork gives the game an approachable first-impression while the play really hooks you in. I can see the game replacing a few of our homes staple filler games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of Herbaceous will run you $25. While it may seem a bit on the higher side for a filler, it’s well worth the price. Pencil First Games has a real winner on their hands with this one, and it’s a game no collection should be without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Herbaceous was provided free for review by Pencil First Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecticon 2017 - Rocky Mountain Dragons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/connecticon2017/rockymountaindragons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rocky Mountain Dragons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://rmdragons.com&quot;&gt;Rocky Mountain Dragons&lt;/a&gt; towards the end of my day and on my 5th or 6th cruise around the Artist Colony. I seriously don’t know how I missed them my first times around the floor. You can see in the pic above that their booth was crammed &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; of dragons! There’s a bunch of variations on 3 different products: Cape Dragons, Shoulder Packs, and hand-crafted, Poseable Dragons (there’s even some foxes, cats, and other critters tossed into the mix.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shoulder Packs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rmdragons.com/collections/shoulder-packs&quot;&gt;$35-$45&lt;/a&gt;]) have a 7”x4.5” pocket on the belly of the pack and when worn it looks as if the dragon is perched over your shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cape Dragons (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rmdragons.com/collections/plushies/products/cape-dragons&quot;&gt;$25&lt;/a&gt; are super soft plushies with velcro on the wing tips to so they can be worn around your neck like a cape. They’re 30 inches tall with a 20-inch wingspan. The horns have wire in them that can be bent and shaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hand-made Poseable Dragons (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rmdragons.com/collections/handmade&quot;&gt;$45&lt;/a&gt;) range from 14-18 inches long, have wired bodies so they can be wrapped around objects, have hand-cast resin heads and feet, and are coated in faux fur. Each dragon is handmade, hand cast, and hand painted. No two are exactly alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m seriously in love with the Poseable Dragons, and my kids were drooling over just about everything they saw from the pictures I took and Rocky Mountain Dragon’s website. I’m hoping there’ll be a dragon, or few, in our future!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecticon 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got back from a full day at &lt;a href=&quot;http://connecticon.org&quot;&gt;Connecticon&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve got a bunch of cool stuff to post about in the next few days. I had a bit of a stressful morning as I arrived at the con to find my press pass had been canceled. Thankfully I was able to get the issue cleared up rather quickly, apparently an issue with GrowTix, and was able to enjoy my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of the day hanging out with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekfevergames.com&quot;&gt;Geek Fever Games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yanaguanagames.com&quot;&gt;Yanaguana Games&lt;/a&gt;, playing their games and generally keeping some great company. I got to try some new prototypes from Geek Fever, and some new revisions of titles I’ve previously played. I even got to see the new Alternate Island for their upcoming game with Thundergryph Games, Dead Man’s Doubloons. With Yanaguana, I got to play a more refined version of Re-Chord, their latest game that’ll be hitting Kickstarter at the end of this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as open gaming on the con is concerned, the tabletop area was packed and as busy as I’ve ever seen it. The convention has grown so much now that most of the tabletop gaming and RPGs have moved to the Mariott next door to the Connecticut Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got to see some amazing hand-crafted toys and goodies in the Artists Colony and Dealer Booths. I’ve picked a few awesome ones to spotlight over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I had a blast. Connecticon is always a great time, and close to home, which makes it even better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Deathstate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/deathstate/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Deathstate&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://breadmachinegames.com&quot;&gt;Bread Machine Games&lt;/a&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackshellmedia.com&quot;&gt;Black Shell Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2015 (PC) / 2017 (PS4)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deathstate-ps4/&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/402120/Deathstate_Abyssal_Edition/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $9.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Elinberg has gone missing while opening a portal endless void. It’s up to you to find out what happened to him by using astral projection in a death-like meditative state. A Deathstate that allows you to travel the far planes and face the terrors that lay within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you survive the hordes of horrors as they swarm over you. Even if you do, can you stay sane? Maybe madness is the key to everything as you become less and less human in order to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deathstate is self-described as a  Rogue-like, bullet hell, single-stick shooter. This pretty much sums up the game pretty well. The basic controls couldn’t be simpler. Move around the screen with the left stick while your character automatically fires a steady of projectiles into oncoming foes. You can also perform a short dash with one button, and unleash a special attack with another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you progress through the game you can obtain Relics and Artifacts that make you more powerful and may give you additional auto attacks or special attacks. There are also mysterious potions to be found who’s effects aren’t known until they’ve been ingested at least once. Last, certain powerful enemies, or treasure chests, may drop organs. These organs give permanent and powerful boosts to your character…until they die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death is permanent, waking you from your Deathstate and causing you to lose any items or organs you found during your last Deathstate. As you play and die more and more items become unlocked, making it slightly easier to find them during your next trip into the void. Everything you’ve unlocked can always be viewed from the Library, your base of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Library will also allow you to switch between any player characters you’ve unlocked. Each has their own base stats and special abilities to be used in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game’s official trailer basically lets you know everything needed to play the game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/f04w8lxc9W4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deathstate is filled with horrific, sometimes disturbing, 16-bit pixel art. The soundtrack is eerie, and a bit unsettling, as is a lot of the sound effects in general. It all combines into a surreal and terrifying package that oozes with theme. Each level has it’s own specific details from pools of blood to obelisks. Enemies vary a bit, though there’s plenty of pallette swapping to give the impression of further diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its ultra-simple controls, unique and retro graphics, and brutally hard gameplay, Deathstate is an amazing overall game that packs a lot of punch for a small pricetag. There are hours upon hours of gameplay as you slowly unlock more powerful items to allow you to progress further and further through the game towards its finale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of secrets, unlockables, and different endings to keep you more than satisfied, all with a $9.99 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A North American PS4 key for Deathstate was provided free for review by Black Shell Media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Micro Review - Chemistry Fluxx</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fluxx/chemistry.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chemistry Fluxx&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Andrew Looney &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.looneylabs.com&quot;&gt;Looney Labs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.looneylabs.com/games/chemistry-fluxx&quot;&gt;$16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 5-30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 8+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.looneylabs.com/lit/rules/chemistry-fluxx-rules&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220193/chemistry-fluxx&quot;&gt;Chemistry Fluxx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemistry Fluxx is one of the latest themed Fluxx games from Looney Labs featuring, you guessed it, elements from the Periodic Table and chemistry equipment. There’s also a few themed Actions and Rules tossed into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.looneylabs.com/lists/chemistry-fluxx-card-list&quot;&gt;card set&lt;/a&gt; as well as new Goals to go along with the new Keepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it compare to other versions of Fluxx?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s Fluxx!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. The game is exactly the same as just about every other version of Fluxx out there. The difference? Science! Chemistry Fluxx is one of the best Fluxx sets I’ve seen in a while, mostly because I’m just a huge fan of the theme. While I enjoy Cartoon Network Fluxx, Zombie Fluxx, and even regular old’ Fluxx, there’s just something about Chemistry Fluxx that feels &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. There’s less of the quirky humor that Fluxx is known for and a bit more of a sophisticated air to this version. All of the goals are simplified combinations of what they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laughing Gas:&lt;/strong&gt; Nitrogen + Oxygen&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Diatomic Molocules:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydrogen + Hydrogen or Oxygen + Oxygen&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Statue of Liberty Green:&lt;/strong&gt; Copper + Oxygen + Carbon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemistry Fluxx is a version of Fluxx that just feels…&lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I’m a big fan of Fluxx and how silly it can be. In the end, though, Chemistry Fluxx is the version of Fluxx I think is going to hit the table a lot more than the other copies I own.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Doomfist Finally Announced for Overwatch</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vaZfZFNuOpI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m fairly new to Overwatch, having only been playing for a couple of months now. In that time I’ve devoured as much lore from the game as possible, so I’m pretty familiar with Doomfist, the latest character announced for Blizzards monumental game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a new article from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/20877886&quot;&gt;Times of Numbani Staff&lt;/a&gt; was posted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://playoverwatch.com&quot;&gt;playoverwatch.com&lt;/a&gt;. The article detailed how Akande Ogundimu, Doomfist, was freed from prison by Reaper. This led the internet into a frenzy of Doomfist anticipation, a character players have been waiting to be announced since before Overwatch was even released. The official announcement came from Blizzard today accompanied by the above video. Doomfist is already playable on the Public Test Region, sadly only for PC players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doomfist is an offense character with &lt;a href=&quot;https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/doomfist/&quot;&gt;impressive set of skills&lt;/a&gt;. No word on when he’ll be available for public consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Rampaging Jotunn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/jotunn/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rampaging Jotunn&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Matthias Bonnici, David Simpson &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lostcog.com&quot;&gt;Lost Cog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 8+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; No&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146762/rampaging-jotunn/images&quot;&gt;Rampaging Jotunn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An island, rich with resources, and hidden away by Vikings holds a deadly secret. Ymir, an ancient and powerful Jotunn, has awoken, slaughtering all in his path. Though the Jotunn is powerful he’s not very smart. The Skálds soon learned how to manipulate him to their own ends, using him to help them earn more power and influence over the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rampaging Jotunn was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/835148483/rampaging-jotunn/description&quot;&gt;successfully funded on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; last year, and is currently available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rampaging Jotunn is a 2 player game where the players are trying to protect their 3 villages while destroying the other player’s villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup, the game each player takes 3 terrain tiles at random from the 12 included in the game to create the board. The numbered central tile is placed in the middle with the Jotunn on top. A die is rolled to see which way the Jotunn will face at the start of the game. Each player takes 3 villages, 2 army standing, and the 3 movement cards for their color. The brown cards are then shuffled into a deck and 5 cards are dealt with each player. Each player then takes turns placing their villages anywhere on the board except volcano tiles and places their army standing next to 2 of their 3 villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A player may take one of three actions on their turn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move an army&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play a card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discard 3 cards to raise a new army (max 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When moving an army, a player chooses on of their available movement cards (2, 3, or 4) and spends those movement points to move across the board. Grasslands require 1 movement point to cross, woods costs 2, and mountains cost 4. Walking across a volcano kills an army. If an army lands on an opponent’s village, that village is destroyed. If an army lands on an opponent’s army, combat ensues with a die roll from each player. Highest number wins. Land on the Jotunn? That’s just not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A player may also move onto their own village to Garrison the village. This basically provides a little extra protection from the other player, making it so the village requires to hits to remove it. The Jotunn will still just stomp it flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a movement card has been used it’s flipped over and can’t be used again until all the other movement cards have been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing a card allows a player to influence to movement of the Jotunn, amongst other things. When moving the Jotunn with a card you need to remember that grasslands and woods cost 1 point for him to move through while mountains cost 2 for him to cross. When played, a card is resolved, discarded, and then a new one is drawn. A player’s hand is always refreshed up to 5 cards when cards are played/discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last option a player has is to raise a new army by discarding 3 cards. This comes in handy when 1 or both armies have been destroyed. A player may never have more than 2 armies on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each player’s turn has ended the Jotunn moves forward one space. If he lands on the volcano he goes back to the center of the board with a die roll to choose his new facing. If he reaches the end of the board he does an 180 and starts moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the basics. The first player to destroy all 3 of the other player’s villages wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rampaging Jotunn comes in a long, empty box. In talks with the designer, this was done intentionally to fit future expansions. Unfortunately, there’s currently no insert inside, so everything just tosses around inside the box, especially the cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The box aside, everything else looks really good. The cardboard terrain pieces and tokens are thick and sturdy. The cards are of good stock and are easy to read. The dice, upgraded via stretch goals during the Kickstarter campaign, are replicas of Mia Bone Dice excavated from sites around Scandinavia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/jotunn/components.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rampaging Jotunn Components&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rampaging Jotunn is simple to learn, and a blast to play. Games tend to be pretty quick, allowing for multiple plays over a single gaming session. There are lots of choices here. You can focus on moving your armies onto your opponent’s villages, or maybe take out their armies first. You can also try and focus on moving the Jotunn to do your dirty work for you. Maybe a combination of the both. Of course, you need to make sure your own villages are protected and the Jotunn stays as far from you as possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of great 2 player games out there, and Rampaging Jotunn is one of them. It’s got a solid, simple set of rules with a great depth of play that will continue to bring it to the table time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Rampaging Jotunn was provided free for review by Lost Cog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Shu</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shu/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shu&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://dead-cells.com&quot;&gt;Motion Twin&lt;/a&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dead-cells.com&quot;&gt;Motion Twin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-gb/games/shu/cid=EP8936-CUSA04583_00-COATSINKSHUPS400&quot;&gt;PS4/Vita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/528720/Shu/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $11.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great Storm destroys Shu’s village, kills the village elder, and scatters Shu’s people. It’s up to him to find the survivors, escape the storm, and find a way to live happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shu was released last year for the PS4/Vita using Cross-Buy and Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shu is a 2.5D platformer where you run, jump, and glide your way through each level. Along the way, there are items to collect in the form of butterflies, babbies (baby chicks), and mural pieces. Butterflies are plentiful, though collecting them all for each level is still a challenge. Babbies and mural pieces are more hidden, and actively need to be searched for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game’s 5 lands (each containing 3 levels), Shu will find two of his friends that were scattered by the Storm. Each of these friends will give Shu additional abilities to help him traverse the levels in that world. One friend makes flower platforms bloom. Other lets Shu skim across the water for a short time. Even another allows Shu to smash through certain terrain. At the end of every land, the two friends found are whisked away to whatever safety awaits them, leaving Shu alone again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shu/storm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Storm&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;The last, and most terrifying, aspect of the game is the Storm. At the end of each land, the Storm will catch up to Shu, grinning its terrifying grin while quickly making its way towards the Shu’s little party. These parts of gameplay are frantically placed, where one wrong move or slip up will find Shu gobbled up by the Storm and having to restart at the last checkpoint. You’re only safe once you reach a Sanctuary and finish the level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus to the game, a free DLC titled Caverns of the Nightjars was released this year that contains 6 more levels. The PS4/Vita also received an exclusive trophy area called The Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shu is filled with amazingly colorful, hand-drawn artwork combined with a catchy soundtrack. Being 2.5D there’s some 3D rendered stuff in there too, but it’d blends wonderfully with the 2D artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZCpCgs2DYjc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shu is an absolute joy to play. It has a very old-school platformer feel with a very modern coat of paint. Each level’s design feels natural, is challenging, and contains enough secrets to have you replaying each level trying to find every last collectible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hours of excellent play in here, with even more added with the game’s free DLC. You can even compete in time trials with global leaderboards, extending replayability even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With simple controls, beautiful visuals, and buttery-smooth gameplay, Shu is a no-brainer at $11.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as you don’t get too freaked out by that damn, smiling storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A North American PS4 key for Shu was provided free for review by Coatsink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Elderwood Academy Scroll &amp; Codex</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a huge fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elderwoodacademy.com/&quot;&gt;Elderwood Academy&lt;/a&gt;’s products from the first time I laid my eyes on them a bit over a year ago. The first time was in picture form when they had sent out the Kickstarter announcement for the Scroll &amp;amp; Codex dice tower and tray. Then, at PAX East, I finally got to take a peek at the physical products, though they were still working out some kinks with the Scroll. Now I’ve got my own set, and I couldn’t be happier with the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scroll &amp;amp; Codex is actually comprised of two different Elderwood products that are meant to be used in conjunction with one another, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elderwoodacademy.com/codex-dice-towers/&quot;&gt;Codex Dice Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elderwoodacademy.com/scroll-roll-up-rolling-tray/&quot;&gt;Scroll Rolling Tray&lt;/a&gt;. Each can be purchased and used separately, but they’re really meant to be a combo team of luxury dice rolling. You can actually order your own as of this month. The Codex starts at $95 and can be customized to be made with different wood, different color leather, custom foil artwork, and cap art. The Scroll is similar, starts at $60, and lets you choose different frame designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set Elderwood sent me to take a look at is made with cherry and maple, with red leather that has the Spellcircle pattern in silver foil. The set also has the Spellcircle pattern etched into the Codex’s cap and Scroll’s frame. The whole thing is stored is a red cloth drawstring bag with Elderwood’s logo emblazoned in gold on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/elderwood/ewsc1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elderwood Academy Scroll &amp;amp; Codex Bag&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of the Scroll &amp;amp; Codex is how the products are made to work together. The Scroll can be disassembled, rolled up, and placed into the Codex for each storage. The Codex’s cap is held on with rare earth magnets to keep everything safely inside until use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/elderwood/ewsc2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elderwood Academy Scroll &amp;amp; Codex Bag&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/elderwood/ewsc3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elderwood Academy Scroll &amp;amp; Codex Bag&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/elderwood/ewsc4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elderwood Academy Scroll &amp;amp; Codex Bag&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/elderwood/ewsc5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elderwood Academy Scroll &amp;amp; Codex Bag&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to roll (I really can’t help myself sometimes. Sorry, not sorry.) just uncap the Codex, slide out the scroll, secure the frame, then twist the bottom cap of the Codex to reveal the opening that the dice come out of. Toss dice in the top and you’re good to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/elderwood/ewsc6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elderwood Academy Scroll &amp;amp; Codex Bag&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/elderwood/ewsc7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elderwood Academy Scroll &amp;amp; Codex Bag&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The craftsmanship of both products is outstanding. They’re sturdy, yet light weight and the attention to detail is out of this world. Between the wood, leather, and laser cut designs they also smell damn fine, too. The whole combo takes a few seconds to fully set up, making it easy bring along with you to those late night RPG sessions or game nights away from home. My kids and I have been using our set a ton already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elderwood may be fairly new to the scene of luxury wooden accessories, but they’ve quickly shown that they’re a force to be reckeoned with. With quality wooden products that won’t break the bank, you can’t go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lycans vs Vampires Fantasy Backgammon</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MVYK-6W2Zg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate to admit it, but I only learned how to actually play Backgammon a handful of years ago. Before then I just saw the came as something that came along for the ride with every chessboard I’ve ever owned. Once I finally learned how to play I realized how much of an awesome classic it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color me surprised today when I see an email come through from Brain Conceptual Entertainment about their new Kickstarter launching soon, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainconceptual.com/backgammon&quot;&gt;Lycans vs Vampires Fantasy Backgammon&lt;/a&gt;. Lycans vs Vampires is luxury Backgammon set that’s just oozing with theme. Here are the stats on the thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A wooden backgammon board, covered with printed artwork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and varnished by hand, on each surface (Inside and outside).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Board Size: 48 x 25.5 x 6cm (Closed) / 48 x 51 x 3cm (Open)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Hinges and clasps are metal made for strength and longevity with black finishing for a similar aesthetic result.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standard metal checkers set: 36mm x 3.5mm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 30 perfectly weighted checkers are specially designed, different color enameled and finished off by hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each set includes: 15 black Lycans &amp;amp; 15 purple Vampires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Acrylic dices: 16mm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doubling Cube: 16mm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bag for storing checkers and dice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bag to carry the backgammon board set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weighs 3,500 grams (almost 8 pounds!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set should be hitting Kickstarter this month. No word on pricing yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mockups for this beast look incredible. It’s a set I’d really love to own.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - The Captain is Dead</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thecaptainisdead/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Captain is Dead&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Joe Price, JT Smith &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alderac.com/thecaptainisdead/&quot;&gt;AEG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/159503/captain-dead&quot;&gt;The Captain is Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the last 10 minutes of your favorite sci-fi show. The captain is dead. The ship is in chaos. It’s up to the remaining 18 crew members to fix the ships jump drive and escape the threats coming from outside, and the ones making their way inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/the-captain-is-dead&quot;&gt;released in 2014&lt;/a&gt; through The Game Crafter, The Captain is Dead is now being distributed by AEG with a new version released in May of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Captain is Dead starts with a ship in Chaos. Players choose one of 18 different characters, each with their own special abilities, and place them in whatever section of the ship they belong in. The board is then set up with various system cards, missiles, battle plans, skills, tools, and threats. The ship now suffers an initial attack.  5 alerts are flipped over one by one and their effects are resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thecaptainisdead/characters.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Captain is Dead Characters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play order is set by the rank of each players’ characters. Each player can take 4 actions, unless their character card says otherwise, to move around the ship, repair systems, craft upgrades, gather materials, kill alien ships and troops, and ultimately work together to repair the ship’s jump drive. Fix the ship and win! If not…well, you’ll be dead. To make matters worse a new alert card is flipped over and resolved at the end of each player’s turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Captain is Dead can be set up at various difficulty levels. You’ve got Coward all the way up to Insane. These basically just adjust how many times you need to repair the ship’s jump drive before it’s fully fixed. Coward only needs you to run a repair 3 times, while Insane has you doing it 9 times…with two less starting missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain is dead. Will you be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thecaptainisdead/artwork.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Captain is Dead Artwork&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Captains is Dead certain has a unique aesthetic to it. The artwork is angular, borderless, and has a certain retro sci-fi look to it. The pieces are top notch, which is something one would expect from AEG. The character and alien standing are of special note, being printed on a clear plastic. Overall it’s a great looking product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of cooperative games, The Captain is Dead is a game you don’t want to pass up. The game requires tight teamwork, flexible planning, and patience to not flip the table every time you suffer crushing defeat.  Even on Normal, the game is &lt;em&gt;brutal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship is in constant need of repair. Even when you think you’ve gotten things under control an alien ship will pull up beside you or alien troops will board the ship, blocking access to certain systems and wounding crew. You’re constantly trying to put out the worst of the fires while still working towards making the necessary repairs to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Captain is Dead is tense, unforgiving, and a wonderful ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of The Captain is Dead was provided free for review by AEG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Dead Cells</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/deadcells/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dead Cells&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://dead-cells.com&quot;&gt;Motion Twin&lt;/a&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dead-cells.com&quot;&gt;Motion Twin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $16.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead Cells is a RogueVania sidescroller with Souls-lite combat and is currently up on Steam for Early Access. In the game, you play as…I dunno…a ball of snot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s actually a collection of some sort of parasitic cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, you’re this clump of icky green and yellow stuff that inhabits a headless, dead body. You’re immediately tossed into a dungeon and left to your own devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being Dead Cells is being offered on Early Access, MotionTwin has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Dead Cells is lots of fun right now, Early Access will make it even better. It’ll last about 8 - 12 months. We will try to double the content. Right now you have about 16 - 20 hours on average for one playthrough. The price will probably increase during/after the EA. We will work very closely with the community to improve the game.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s actually a longer version &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by describing Dead Cells as a RogueVania game with Souls-lite combat probably gives you a good idea of how the game plays. Platforming exploration, upgradable items/abilities to be bought with Cells (earned from defeated enemies), permadeath, and all sorts of hidden secrets are all par for the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead Cells starts you off in a freshly possessed body with a rusty sword. From here you can snag either a Bow or Shield for your secondary action slot. That gives you two buttons to attack/defend with. Your character can also jump, double jump, roll, use up to 2 special secondary items (bombs, knives, etc…), and other abilities. All of these items can be upgraded through play, and new items can also be unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/deadcells/moves1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Moves&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;There’s also Runes to be found throughout that game that give you permanent powers. These are the things that are going to allow you to explore more of the map, or to quickly get to areas that previously took a bit of time to get to. You generally get Runes from bosses after a bit of tough exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the map, it’s always changing. Every time you die you come back to a completely different map. The same areas are always connected in the same ways, but their layouts are always different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how I mentioned, “every time you die?” There are no checkpoints in Dead Cells. When you die, you being all over again from the start. You retain any Runes you’ve found and anything you bought with collected Cells is still purchased, but you’re starting off fresh with just a rusty sword all the same. Also, you’ll lose all the Cells and gold you’ve collected up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cells are the upgrade currency of Dead Cells, while gold lets you open certain doors and buy items from shops found throughout the map. Cells are spent when you progress from one area of the map to another. You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; spend all your current Cells before you can proceed. Items like new weapons, weapon upgrades, starting bonuses, etc… can all be purchased with Cells. These upgrades make you just a bit stronger when you die and restart the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you become stronger, you’ll be able to reach farther and farther into the map. As you do you’ll discover more secrets, unlock more upgrades, and maybe even discover some bits about the story and what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead Cells’ pixel graphics are nothing to scoff at. Everything from the environments, enemies, weapons, and effects are highly detailed with the utmost of care. Everything is animated which makes everything look &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; as you play through the game. The soundtrack manages to be both excellent, but not overbearing. It resides just below the surface of the game accenting it but never pushing itself too far into your perspective that you lose track of the action on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KV6fBYuuPMg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the game is still in Early Access, Dead Cells is shaping up to be one of the best Metroidvania style games in recent times. The Roguelike and Souls-lite elements, integrated seamlessly into gameplay, just elevate the game far and above similar titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has a smooth and fast-paced feel that let’s you glide through the map, delivering brutal attacks while rolling and jumping out of the way or your enemies. All the while the tension builds as your health deteriorates, or you stumble upon a new and unpredictable foe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead Cells is certainly worth the price for any Metroidvania or Roguelike fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroes &amp;amp; Tricks had very successful Kickstarter campaign last year and recently started hitting the hands of backers. The game immediately caught peoples’ attention with its unique box that is used as a part of the game to cards, only revealing a bit of information about the last cards played into it. The combination of the box and the cute and colorful art made it an instant favorite among Kickstarter backers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroes &amp;amp; Tricks is a light trick taking game where players are trying to win the most Heroes. Each trick is a round where players place cards in the deck box. A full game is a set of tricks played using a single hand of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup is simple. The 3 decks of cards, Play Cards, Hero Cards, and Gear Cards, are shuffled individually. All the Hero cards go into the game box behind the back divider. Each player then gets 3 Gear Cards and a number of Play Cards depending on the number of players. All the unused Play and Gear Cards are placed in the middle of game box. Now each player passes 2 Play Cards and 1 Gear Card to their left. This only happens once per hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/heroestricks/play.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heroes &amp;amp; Tricks Play&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;At the start of each trick each player may play a Gear card into the front of the game box as long as it’s labeled “Play Before the Trick.” Once that’s done, the first player draws a Hero Card from the back of the box, looks at it, and places it in the front of the box with, optionally, a Gear Card and a Play Card in front of it. Only the number, color, and suit of the Play Card should be visible in the box’s notch. The box is then closed and passed to the next player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until all players have played cards. The last player to play a card then lays out all the cards, in order, to resolve who won the trick. The winner is determined using the following rules, moving down the list if no one meets the criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Player who played the highest card matching the color and the suit of the Hero&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Player who played the highest card matching the color of the Hero&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Player who played the highest card matching the suit of the Hero&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Player who played the highest card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the winner is determined they take the Hero and the next trick starts with the player who revealed the last trick. The game continues this way until all but 2 cards are played from the players’ hands. Points from Heroes and Gear are added up to determine the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some variations to the rules, tie breakers, etc… that can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-p7DIXUypq0Wno2Z1ZmT2lHUkE/view&quot;&gt;full rulebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually, Heroes &amp;amp; Tricks is a treat. Colorful, cartoony artwork adorns every card and adds to the overall fantasy theme of the game. The box is also awesome with its dividers to store cards during play and the notched top used to keep all but a bit of information about the last card played. The entire game is sturdy, portable, and strikingly well made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/heroestricks/heroes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heroes &amp;amp; Tricks Heroes&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroes &amp;amp; Tricks has a lot going for it with its beautiful art, quirky box mechanic, and simple ruleset. Unfortunately, it falls a bit flat once you put everything into practice due to the blind nature of the card play. There’s a bit of deduction here, but in the end, you’re playing cards inside the box with little more than a hope unless you’ve got some interesting Gear Cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a game where you’re excited to play, and even may really enjoy the first few rounds, but in the end, you feel like there wasn’t much to be done other than “roll the dice” and hope for the best. The game is by no means bad, but it’s not very memorable beyond the gimmick of its box. Surely there’s some people out there who will get immense pleasure out of this one, it just wasn’t for me and mine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yu-Gi-Oh! July Releases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yu-gi-oh/battlesoflegend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Battles of Legend&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;July is pretty much here, so here’s the latest Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG releases. July will see two releases: &lt;strong&gt;Battles of Legend –Light’s Revenge–&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Starter Deck –Link Strike–&lt;/strong&gt;. Both will be released on July 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light’s Revenge&lt;/strong&gt; is an 80 all-foil card set, 60 Ultra Rares and 20 Secret Rares, sold in 5-card booster packs. &lt;strong&gt;Link Strike&lt;/strong&gt; is a new starter deck that introduces Link Monsters, and features 43 cards, 38 Commons, 2 Ultra Rares, 3 Super Rares. You can find more info on the deck from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Yu-Gi-Oh-Link-Strike-Release/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; back in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s a ways off Konami has shared a sneak peek of &lt;strong&gt;Circuit Break&lt;/strong&gt;, a set being released on October 20th that will contain 100 cards, including 48 Commons, 20 Rares, 14 Super Rares, 10 Ultra Rares and 8 Secret Rares. Cards like &lt;em&gt;Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys&lt;/em&gt; will return in powerful phantasmal forms. &lt;strong&gt;Circuit Break&lt;/strong&gt; introduces an infected strain of insectoid Mekkstrosities that emulate the human nervous system. They cluster rapidly, attempting to take the form of neurons, and if they succeed, all enemy monsters freeze up and become unable to defend their controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I normally have a bit more information, and images, to post with these releases, but it seems Konomi is using a new PR company that doesn’t provide as much detail as their last one. Hopefully this changes in the future and I can provide more details, earlier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Augmented Empire Announced for the Samsung Gear VR</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bf8m7jB_slw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rare that I see something cool and new come along for Samsung’s Gear VR platform, so I was excited to find out that Coatsink has a new VR RPG on the way called Augmented Empire. Arriving on July 13 for $9.99, the game will be exclusive for the Gear VR and will have over 10+ hours of gameplay, full gamepad support, and some great voice actors including Kate Mulgrew (Star Trek Voyager, Orange is the new Black) and Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dear, Hot Fuzz.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented Empire is a cyberpunk RPG taking place on the island of New Savannah, a neo-noir city divided into tiers by the Citizen Grade System. As you can probably guess, the rich and famous live in luxury while the criminals and poor live in squalor, underneath everyone else. The game has you controlling 6 different characters from an ‘augmented reality’ rig while you interact with items in your own office to investigate new developments, make calls, and develop your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have a copy of the game soon to check out and will have a full review posted once I have.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hasbro and Nintendo Team Up for Monopoly Gamer</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow any boardgame circles online you’ve probably heard a lot of Monopoly Gamer in the past few days. A lot of gamers are going nuts for the game, even when most have a strong aversion to Monopoly in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasbro and Nintendo have teamed up for this powered-up version of Monopoly to create a game that plays a bit like Monopoly but contains some thematic and mechanical flair from the world of Super Mario. Coins replace standard Monopoly currency, characters have special powers, there are boss fights, and a lot more. There are even Power Packs you can buy to add new characters from the Super Mario universe to the game, each with their own unique powers. All the fan favorites are here: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Toad, Rosalina, Diddy Kong, Wario, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, you can only snag Monopoly Gamer at Gamestop locations. The game will see greater distribution in the Fall. The base set costs $24.99, while the Power Packs are available for $2.99.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Smash Up All Stars Event Kit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;AEG recently released a kit for retailers to run a Smash Up event with some exclusive goodies. The kit contains 2 copies of the base game, a giant neoprene play mat, a bag with some tokens, and 8 packs of an all new All Star faction that contains some of the best cards from previously released factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all the kit can support up to 8 players and is might impressive for a total of $110. Events are pretty much the only place to snag the new faction booster, so find one near you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stepping Down from Purple Pawn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in October of 2009, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jergames.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Yehuda Berlinger&lt;/a&gt; asked for contributors to his tabletop news site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;. I figured, “why not?” and shot him off an email saying I’d be interested. Shortly after that, I posted my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2009/09/catalyst-red-%e2%80%93-retail-electronic-delivery/&quot;&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt; on the site. Over the next 7 years and 9 months, I posted 1,440 articles. I went from being a Contributor to an Editor, helping out not only by posting articles but on the technical end of the site as well. I also saw the site change hands to its current Owner, David Miller, met many amazing people, played too many awesome games to count, and attended some really awesome events/conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to April 2016. Just a little over a year ago I started A Pawn’s Perspective as an outlet to post overflow game reviews and to take a look at other awesome stuff that didn’t fall into Purple Pawn’s scope. Back then I never expected the site to take off like it has. Soon A Pawn’s Perspective was taking up most of my free time, and I started posting to Purple Pawn less and less. I felt a bit guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the past couple of months coming to a very difficult decision. That decision was to step down from Purple Pawn and focus purely on A Pawn’s Perspective. It wasn’t easy. Purple Pawn has given me so many amazing experiences and opportunities over the years. They’ve sent me to Toy Fair, PAX East, and other, smaller conventions. They’ve helped me build lasting relationships with publishers. They’ve helped me make new and lasting friendships with people I would have never otherwise met. While Yehuda pulled me on, I owe a lot of that to David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Purple Pawn. It’s an excellent site with its own unique content. Both David and &lt;a href=&quot;http://denaghdesign.com/&quot;&gt;Thomas Deeny&lt;/a&gt;, another fellow Pawn, are great people to work with. I’m actually hoping I can continue to work with them in the future on some joint projects between Purple Pawn and A Pawn’s Perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I’d just like to say thanks to Yehuda for giving me a shot. Thanks to David for keeping me around, for providing such excellent opportunities, and being an overall great guy. Thanks to Purple Pawn for being the creative outlet I desperately needed for almost 8 years. I wouldn’t have gotten to where I am today without it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nintendo Announces SNES Classic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/nintendo/snesclassic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SNES Classic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Nintendo announced the upcoming arrival of the SNES Classic Edition, another mini console, that will be released on 9/29. MSRP for this baby will be $80, and it comes with the system, 2 controllers, HDMI cable, USB charging cable with AC adapter, and 21 built-in games. What games are included? Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contra III: The Alien Wars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Donkey Kong Country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EarthBound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Fantasy III&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;F-ZERO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kirby Super Star&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kirby’s Dream Course&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mega Man X&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secret of Mana&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star Fox&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star Fox 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super Castlevania IV&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super Mario Kart&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super Mario World&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super Metroid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super Punch-Out!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoshi’s Island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice Star Fox 2 on there? Yup. It’s a sequel that was never released. There have been a few unfinished versions of the game floating around as ROMS, but this is the first time it’s getting an official release. Of course, you first need to get your hands on a SNES Classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nintendo had tons of supply issues with the NES Mini, driving aftermarket sales prices to insane amounts due to people not being able to find the system in stores. Let’s hope Nintendo has learned from their past mistake and makes plenty of SNES Classics available to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Damascus Gear: Operation Tokyo HD</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/damascusgear/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Damascus Gear: Operation Tokyo HD&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; APLUS Co&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arcsystemworksu.com/game/damascus-gear-operation-tokyo/&quot;&gt;Arc System Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/damascus-gear-operation-tokyo-hd-edtion/cid=UP0036-CUSA08326_00-DGEARHD000000000&quot;&gt;PS4/Vita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $14.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAGE, unpiloted Gears (mechs) with corrupt AI, are slowly killing off the world’s population forcing humanity underground. You’re a pilot of an Anti-RAGE Gear unit called Freya, a group tasked with destroying RAGE and taking back Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damascus Code: Operation Tokyo HD is an HD remake of 2014’s Damascus Code: Operation Tokyo with all the DLC included and a new chapter that takes place after the main story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damascus Code: Operation Tokyo HD is a single-player, isometric, mission-based, hack and slash mech game with customizable mechs. Pilot your gear through waves of various enemy RAGE with ranged, melee, and ultra weapons. Your Gear also has boosters for making short dashes out of harm’s way or boosting through empty areas of the map and the ability to use repair kits to restore health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missions have various completion conditions. On some, you just have to destroy all RAGE in the area. Other, a specific type of RAGE units or an ultra-strong RAGE. There are missions where you’ll have to escort things, somewhere you just need to survive, and other where your only objective is to navigate to a certain area of the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/damascusgear/custom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Damascus Gear: Operation Tokyo HD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between missions, you can customize your Gear with parts salvaged from enemy RAGE or purchased from the shop. Each part of your gear can be swapped out and painted from a choice from a multitude of colors. Your Gear can also hold a weapon in each hand, plus a back mounted ultra-weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a thin story tossed into the mix, but there’s really nothing of much substance considering your enemy is a soulless machine. The story is completely one-sided, and basically there to get you from mission to mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the graphics in Damascus Gear: Operation Tokyo HD are nothing to write home about, they’re not too bad, either. Gears are impressive looking, and the maps varied enough. Things can get a bit hectic looking with a ton of Gears on the map, or with giant lasers taking up much of screen, but it’s something you get used to over time. The biggest issue on the visual front is now little variation there is in the enemy RAGE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound is pretty generic, as is the music. It doesn’t get in the way, nor does it really add to gameplay at all. It’s just there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GnM_nFrcDwk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I stated earlier, Damascus Gear: Operation Tokyo HD has pretty much no story, generic music and sound, and visuals that are purely functional. That being said the game is still a blast to play. It’s a button-mashing mech game where you’re cutting down swarms of enemy mechs with all sorts of cool weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall there’s a little over 50 missions to complete, which feels like just enough to have a great time with the game without getting stale. Gear customization will keep you playing “one more mission” just to see what cool stuff you’ve salvaged or can purchase in the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damascus Gear: Operation Tokyo HD is short, sweet, and overall a solid play experience. Sadly, it’s not a game that I think is worth going back to once you’ve finished it. Hopefully it’s good enough that we’ll see another, more in-depth, title in the series in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Planetarium</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/planetarium/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Planetarium&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; Stéphane Vachon&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamesalute.com&quot;&gt;Game Salute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamesworthplaying.com/shop/planetarium&quot;&gt;$39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 45 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 10+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57dbf7106b8f5b39fb80757a/t/5816acd01b631bded31a9a20/1477881044718/Planetarium-Rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/200454/planetarium&quot;&gt;Planetarium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After raising almost $130,000 on Kickstarter during June of 2016 Planetarium was released at the end of March 2017. The game has players creating a unique solar system every play, with an emphasis on science. Developed with the help of a scientist working on NASA’s search for life on Mars, each and every card in the game includes thematic and scientifically accurate planetary phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planetarium’s board is setup with rings circling a central star. There are 4 planets, one at each corner of the board, two gaseous and two terrestrial. A Hostile Token is placed on each of the planets at the start of the game. The game’s Matter Tokens are mixed up and placed on each white dot along the board’s rings while the 4 Planetary Tokens are placed on their dedicated starting spots. At this point, the board is setup and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the players go, each gets a player mat depicting the 4 planets, a set of score markers and cubes in their color, and a starting hand of 5 cards. Each player’s hand is made up of 2 Low Evolution Cards, 2 High Evolution Cards, and a Final Evolution card. Each player actually draws two Final Evolution cards, but then must choose one to discard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During each player’s turn, they move either a Matter Token or a Planetary Token clockwise around the board. Matter Tokens can move one space along the thicker, circular rings or along the thinner lines that connect rings. Matter Tokens can only land on an empty space or Planetary Token. Planets can move as many spaces as they want along the thicker lines as long as nothing is blocking them. They can still only move one space along the thinner lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/planetarium/inprogress.png&quot; alt=&quot;Planetarium Game In Progress&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;If a Matter Token is moved onto a Planetary Token or vise-verse, the Matter Token is removed and placed on the current player’s mat on the corresponding Planet space. These tokens are used to play Evolution Cards. After a player makes a move they may play an Evolution Card if they’ve met all the requirements on the card. The required Matter Tokens are moved from their player mat onto the Evolution Track and the Evolution Card is played onto the planet where the Matter was taken from. The player’s score is then increased by the amount shown on the Evolution Card and draws either a new Low or High Evolution Card, or draws two Final Evolution Cards and chooses one to discard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may also affect the Habitability of a planet. Each Evolution Card adds to either the Hostile or Habitable score of the planet it’s played on. Whenever one score is higher than the other the Hostile/Habitable token on the planet is flipped. The state of a planet will determine what Final Evolution Cards can be played on it at the end of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Evolution Track is filled up eventually Matter Tokens can be moved up to two spaces instead of one. One the track is filled the end-game is triggered and Final Evolution Cards may finally be played. Once all is said and done scores are tallied and the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a bit more to gameplay, but the above is a good overview. For a full explanation, including examples of play, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57dbf7106b8f5b39fb80757a/t/5816acd01b631bded31a9a20/1477881044718/Planetarium-Rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;full rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork and iconography in Planetarium are both stunning and functional. Every detail from the board, Evolution Cards, Matter Tokens, player mats, and tokens are the highest production value. The glossy box tends to scratch easily, but a bit of extra care is all that’s needed to keep the game in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/planetarium/piecesreview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pieces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planetarium has a lot of different pieces, takes a while to setup, and looks like a complicated game at first glance. Once you dig in, the game plays wonderfully fluid, with rules that are not only easy to grasp, but presented wonderuflly in one of the best rulebooks I’ve seen in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the game, movement options are limited and resources are extremely easy to gather. This makes getting the first few Low Evolution cards on the table rather easy. As the game goes on and the resource supply diminishes is it becomes a bit harder to get exactly what you need to place any Evolution card. Smart movement and careful planning are needed to other players don’t snipe the Matter Tokens needed to keep scoring points, or setting up planets for Final Evolution Cards. In the end, that’s the real goal, getting Final Evolution Cards on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real beauty of Planetarium is the long game, trying to get planets ready, not only for the Final Evolution Card in your hand at the start of the game but for any that you draw during play. Strategies will need to be adapted as your hand of cards changes and other players foil your current plans by snagging that last Metal or changing a planet from Habitable to Hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planetarium is available through Game Salute for $39 and is worth every penny of that. While a lighter game, there’s still enough choice and options to keep multiple plays feeling fresh and enjoyable, especially in the 2-3 player range.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Unearth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/unearth/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unearth&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; Jason Harner, Matthew Ransom&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://brotherwisegames.com&quot;&gt;Brotherwise Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brotherwisegames.com/product/unearth-preorder/&quot;&gt;$29.95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 25-50 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 8+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brotherwisegames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unearth-Web-Rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217085/unearth&quot;&gt;Unearth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A once-great civilization now lies in ruins, buried beneath the earth. As a tribe of Delvers, you try to unearth what was once lost and rebuild the Wonders that the old-world enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reclaim. Rebuild. Remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unearth is Brotherwise Games latest game, and it’s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Unearth is to have the most points at the end of the game. Players compete to claim Ruins with using their dice and build Wonders with stones they excavate from those ruins. Points are scored by having multiple Ruins of the game color, sets of Ruins of each color, and bulding Wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/unearth/ruins.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ruins&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;At the start of the game, 5 random Ruins are laid out with a number of stones placed on them (dictated by the card) as well as a set number of Named Wonders equal to the number of players plus 2. There are also generic Lesser and Greater Wonder tile stacks. 5 Ruin cards are taken from the top of the deck and placed back in the box, and a random End of Era card is placed at the bottom of the Ruin deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player is then given a set of dice (1d8, 3d6, and 1d4), a random Ruin that they keep secret, and 2 Delver cards. The rest of the Delver cards are placed face down to form a draw deck. Players then roll to see who goes first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player’s turn has two phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delver Phase - Play any amount of Delver cards from their hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll Phare - Choose a die from their pool, choose a Ruin to roll for, roll the die and place it on the chosen Ruin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/unearth/stones.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stones&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;If a die roll is 1, 2, or 3 the player takes stone is taken from the Ruin and places it on the table in front of them. If the total value of all dice on a Ruin meet or exceed the number in the upper left-hand corner the Ruin has been uncovered, and the player who has the highest single value on a die takes the Ruin. Any remaining stones are placed in the bag and a new Ruin is placed on the table. Any other players that had dice on the Ruin can take as many Delver cards from the draw pile as they had dice on the Ruin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonders can be built by a player when they form a ring of stones in front of them. A Greater Wonder can be built by creating a ring of same color stones. A Lesser Wonder can be built by creating a ring with any combination of colors. A Named Wonder can be claimed by building a ring meeting the criteria laid out on the Named Wonder’s card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until all Ruins are claimed. Scores are then calculated and the player with the highest score wins. For more information on scoring, and all the extra details of playing Unearth, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brotherwisegames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unearth-Web-Rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;full rulebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unearth is an amazing looking game that has an art style reminiscent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monumentvalleygame.com&quot;&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The Ruin cards are oversized, colorful, and each features a beautifully illustrated ruin. Named wonders feature similar artwork, yet are smaller cards with a matching hexagonal tile. Lesser and Greater Wonder tiles follow suit, but without unique artwork for each tile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the dice go, they’re pretty standard polyhedrals. Nothing overly special, but they get the job done. Delver cards are tiny, and a bit less colorful, matching the more stark look of the game’s  characters that they’re named for. Last, but certainly not least, are the different colored stones. These are a chunky cardboard tile that look very similar to Minecraft blocks in 4 different colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/unearth/components.png&quot; alt=&quot;Components&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unearth offers lighter fare gameplay with multiple routes to victory. It’s also highly interactive as players constantly battle for control of ruins. Tough choices need to be made every turn. Which die to roll, which Ruin to choose, whether or not to go straight for claiming Ruins or taking your time and trying to gather enough stones to build Wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claiming mechanic of only need the highest value die on a Ruin makes for interesting conflict. A player can be working toward a Ruin, having multiple dice on it, only to have it swiped by another player with a lucky roll. A player who manages to claim a large amount of Ruins may find themselves lacking stones, or even more detrimental, lacking Delver cards to use to modify rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Wonders there are more choices to be made. Do you aim for the harder to get, higher value Greater Wonders? Lower Wonders are easier to get but are worth much less. Named Wonders can be worth a lot if certain criteria are met, and some also give you special abilities. They’re generally harder to build, and certainly, require a focus on earning stones and sacrificing Ruin claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choices, player interaction, and interesting mechanics make Unearth a solid gaming experience with a playtime of around 10 minutes per player once you’re familiar with the rules. At $30 it’s a great value for the amount of play and variation you’ll get out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation? Unearth is certainly a game that deserves a spot on your game shelf. Brotherwise has put out an amazing experience both visually and mechanically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://magecompanygames.com&quot;&gt;MAGE Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://magecompanygames.com/shop/carrotia/&quot;&gt;$19.99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 20-30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 8+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/129974/english-rules&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191041/carrotia&quot;&gt;Carrotia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With carrot supplies running low the rabbits must venture out into bird infested paths to try and collect enough carrots to survive. In Carrotia players must build the most efficient maze in time to get some carrots and get out before the birds snatch them up. Released in 2016, the game is part of MAGE Companies “Family Zone” line of games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A game of Carrotia is played over three rounds, each with a building phase and movement phase. The game is setup by setting up 3 piles of quest cards, each with its corresponding sand timer, choosing a character, and giving each player a set number of tiles based on the number of players in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all the players are ready a Quest 1 card is flipped over, along with the 30-second sand timer. Players now take turns placing tiles on the board to best match the criteria laid out on the Quest card. The Quest card will show you where the rabbit enters and exits the maze, where carrots are located, and where birds start. Once the time is up players must stop building. If tiles were laid incorrectly, or need to be rearranged to fit the Quest criteria, another bird is placed on the board which gives the players extra moves to complete the maze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the maze is complete players take turns moving the rabbit meeple through the maze trying to collect as many carrots as they can and get out in 10 moves. The rabbit cannot move backward. Each time the rabbit moves a bird die is rolled dictating where the bird moves. Different birds wreak different kinds of mayhem on the board, carrots, or rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the movement phase, players can use the special ability of their rabbit once. Abilities range from the ability to move backward to collecting extra carrots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the round is completed players move on to Quest 2 and must now build a 4x4 maze in 60 seconds using the previous round’s 3x3 maze as a base. Round 3 adds and extra bird to the board, but also raises the move limit to 15. Quest 3 gives you 90 seconds to build a 5x5 maze, add even another bird and gives you 20 moves to finish the maze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all 3 Quests are completed the game is won if more than 20 carrots were collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is Carrotia is thick and sturdy. Quest cards are similar in quality to standard playing cards, though square, while tiles are the same dimensions and are a chunky cardboard. The bird and carrot tokens are a similar cardboard as the tiles, just not as thick. All the dice included in the game are wooden with enough heft as to not feel cheap. The included rabbit meeple is large and pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/carrotia/pieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Carrotia Pieces&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover art on the box is excellent, with a very fantasy feel to it. Unfortunately, the character art on the character cards falls a bit flat. It’s a bit darker, grittier, and not up to par with what’s presented on the outside of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost gave up on Carrotia the first two times I tried to play the game with my 7-year-old son. We just couldn’t make heads or tails of the rules included in the box. I was ready to give the game up like a bad habit and write a pretty scathing review. I figured I’d look up some videos on how to play to make sure I wasn’t missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the version of the rules that came in our box are well known for being pretty terrible, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/129974/english-rules&quot;&gt;newer set of rules&lt;/a&gt; that are much clearer were written for the game. With the new rules in hand, we were able to get through the game easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrotia is very light but works well for younger players. The concept of building a maze to fit a quest card takes a bit of getting used to, especially during Quest 1 when you only have 30 seconds to do so. After a bit of play, it feels a bit more natural and things get a bit easier. The random movement of the birds tends to liven things up when you really nail a maze and think you’re in the clear, which kind of self-balances the game a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend Carrotia for players aged 6-10, and 10 is pushing it a bit. While it’s a bit much for younger players, it’s certainly not enough for older players. My 10-year-old and 11-year-old weren’t feeling the game as much as my 7-year-old was. You know what? That’s perfectly OK. 6-8 years old feels like the real sweet spot for the game, and at $20 you won’t be breaking the bank for a family game that’s light, entertaining, and pretty fast paced.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Beasts of Balance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beastsofbalance/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beasts of Balance&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; George Buckenham, Alex Fleetwood&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sensibleobject.com&quot;&gt;Sensible Object&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://beastsofbalance.com/store/&quot;&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 15-20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 7+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://beastsofbalance.com&quot;&gt;Sort of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com./boardgame/185709/beasts-balance&quot;&gt;Beasts of Balance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created by a team of designers from Sensible Object, Beasts of Balance combines elements of toys, boardgames, and video games to create a unique dexterity game experience where players work together to build an amazing digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beasts of Balance is a balancing game where players stack objects onto a plinth that connects via Bluetooth to a mobile device. Objects placed on the plinth populate the game world on the mobile device and count towards the players’ score. The game contains several animals, elements, and artifacts that each affect the environment in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are beasts that populate the air, sea, and land. This is where the balance part comes in (well, other than actually balancing the pieces on the plinth.) As players build they need to keep the three different parts of the environment in balance. Too many water animals? Your land score may go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the beasts, there are elemental pieces that can boost their respective animals’ scores. There’s also artifacts that can merge two beasts or migrate a beast from one area to another. Merge a shark and eagle to get a completely new creature, or migrate a boar into the ocean to get another. There are tons of unique beasts to unlock in your app’s bestiary. You can also unlock Elemental Beasts by getting a beast’s individual score up past 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beasts of Balance also includes two Disruptors. These provide huge in-game bonuses but require you to hold, tap, or take some other action on the mobile screen while stacking items. This makes it &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier to topple the whole tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the last part of Beasts of Balance. When the tower topples a volcano appears on screen, ready to erupt. Quickly rebuild the tower to save the world. If not, it’s game over and the total score is tallied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final score is calculated by your actual beast scores and your new discoveries made during the current play session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beasts of Balance is a &lt;em&gt;beautifully&lt;/em&gt; designed game. All the plastic pieces are colorful, carefully weighted, and created using angles so that each piece can be stacked onto the plinth in many different ways. The actual app, itself, follows the same design sense and is a joy to watch as the physical pieces come to life as the players create their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beastsofbalance/pieces.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beasts of Balance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cool thing is that you can 3D print your own pieces for the game by &lt;a href=&quot;https://beastsofbalance.com/diyfiles/&quot;&gt;grabbing the STL files&lt;/a&gt; from the Beasts of Balance site. To use your new pieces you’ll need to buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://beastsofbalance.com/product/diy-artefacts-pack/&quot;&gt;DIY pack&lt;/a&gt; that will get you RFID tags for these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beasts of Balance is a lot of fun. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun. I’m a huge fan of stacking games as it is, but the worldbuilding aspect with the mobile app takes the game to the next level. Discovering new beasts and attempting to take your score even higher is exciting and satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few problems as of right now.  The first is the lack of a competitive play. All the players work together to create the best score possible, but there aren’t leaderboards for groups to compete against other groups. It wouldn’t make sense to have local players compete against each other, but it would be nice to have a global community of players that compete against each other in various challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem Beasts of Balance has is its price. At $100, plus needing a mobile device to play, it’s pretty pricey. Even with a box full of amazing pieces and the Bluetooth plinth needed to connect to the app, it’s a lot of money to pay for a dexterity game.  A bit more content might help alleviate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beasts of Balance sets out to provide a beautiful, unique, and entertaining experience and certainly does so. Price aside, the game is a blast to play.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hasbro Transformers x Primitive Skateboarding SDCC 2017 Exclusive</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today Hasbro revealed their exclusive Transformers SDCC 2017 item, Transformers Primitive Optimus Prime. The figure, designed in conjunction with Primitive Skateboarding’ legendary skateboarder, Paul Rodriguez, will be available for sale for $49.99 at booth #3329 at Comic-Con International in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this…interesting…flavor text from the press release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before OPTIMUS PRIME was blasting DECEPTICONS in battle, he was greasing the wheels of his skateboard with fellow skater, SHREDDICUS MAXIMUS. Shredding rad gnar on the boardwalks of the Senti Rust Pier, they up their street cred while nailing down their signature trick, the Null-Ray-Ray, annihilating the competition into mere grime… Now get ready for the gnarliest TRANSFORMERS stunt of the 21st century…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primitive Optimus Prime comes in Primitive’s classic black and gold color scheme and comes in a “skate shoe” box to further follow the theme. Inside the box is Leader Glass Optimus Prime, a Titan Master Shreddicus Maximus figure, and eight accessories, including a rail, ramp and hover board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/transformers/primitiveprime.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Primitive Prime&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t made SDCC, a limite number of these figures will be available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://HasbroToyShop.com&quot;&gt;HasbroToyShop.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Rhino Hero</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rhinohero/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rhino Hero&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; Scott Frisco, Steven Strumpf&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habausa.com&quot;&gt;HABA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2011&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habausa.com/rhino-hero.html&quot;&gt;$13.99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 5-15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 5+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habausa.com/bloghtdocs/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4789-rhino-hero-instructions-5s.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91514/rhino-hero&quot;&gt;Rhino Hero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super Rhino is a super, and very heavy, hero. As he patrols the city and keeps its citizens save he bounds from building to building, being very careful not to topple them! Rhino Hero is a dexterity game of stacking cards for kids ages 5+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most HABA games, Rhino Hero is incredibly easy to play. Basically, you want to get rid of your hand of 5 roof tiles. You do this by carefully building up a skyscraper, using special cards to foil other players, and being very careful not to topple the whole thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could explain the game in more detail, but HABA has the perfect video that explains how to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cyxrUr2q-18&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rhinohero/tower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tower&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
HABA always uses the utmost care when designing their games. Rhino Hero follows suit with a familiar, sturdy yellow box, thick cards, and a wonderful wooden Super Rhino. The coolest bits in the box are the wall cards which can be folded in half so they can be stacked easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhino Hero should certainly stand up to family play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard not to love Rhino Hero. With its loveable hero, simple mechanics, and engaging gameplay, it’s quickly become a family favorite in our household. Our 3-year-old and 7-year-old love stacking the cards and watching the tower topple, whole our 10 and 11-year-old enjoy trying their hand at the harder difficulty, starting the tower with just one support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re big HABA fans in our house, and Rhino Hero has quickly shot up the ranks as one of the best HABA games we own. With a $13.99 price tag, there’s no reason not to add Rhino Hero to your family’s collection.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - BattleGoats</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/battlegoats/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;BattleGoats&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; Tucker Smedes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cardlords.com/product/battlegoats/&quot;&gt;CardLords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cardlords.com/product/battlegoats/&quot;&gt;$19.99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 30-90 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 9+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cardlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BattleGoats-Rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/202513/battlegoats&quot;&gt;BattleGoats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BattleGoats was funded on Kickstarter in May of 2016 raising over $9,500 from 331 backers. The game features, you guessed it, goats that battle it out for total supremacy in a mix of War and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing BattleGoats is super easy. Each player is given a Hero card at random from the deck.  Then players get 8 more cards either at random or using a draft. One each player has their 9 cards they arrange them in a 3x3 grid and play begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn a player chooses one of their cards to initiate an attack. They then choose any other player’s cards to attack. Both cards are flipped and the card with the higher number wins. The winner is flipped back over while the loser discards their card. Ties see both cards discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s all there was to BattleGoats it wouldn’t be very interesting. Thankfully every card has a special ability that affects gameplay. Certain cards gain bonuses depending on where they’re placed in the grid. Other cards may get bonuses based on how many cards are in your discard pile. There are even cards that cause opponent’s cards to flip face up for the rest of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BattleGoats ends when there’s only one player left with any cards on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BattleGoats contains 55 cards in a heavy duty polypropylene box. The superdeformed artwork is cute, colorful, and family friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/battlegoats/cards.png&quot; alt=&quot;BattleGoats Cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BattleGoats was a bit of a surprise. Normally saying a game is a mix of War and Memory wouldn’t seem that interesting. Between a mix of excellent cards, finding the best way to layout said cards in a 3x3 grid, and tons of special abilities, BatteGoats manages to be an easy-to-learn, entertaining, filler game. A bit more depth can even be added the game by using the card drafting rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it certainly won’t be winning any awards for being the most thought provoking or strategic game, it’s certainly got enough going for it to rise above your standard mass-market fare. It’s light, fun, quick, and rugged enough to take with your wherever you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch? The price. A copy of BattleGoats runs $20. That’s a lot of money for 55 cards. It’s a game that feels like it should be in the $10-$12 range. If that price were ever to come down a bit it would make it a bit easier to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

The Party Crate will contain games with content geared toward college students, young adults, and parents who are looking to enjoy “adults-only” game nights. Hasbro has mentioned games like: Judgmental, Box of Rocks, and Speak Out: Joe Santagato Edition. The Family Crate, on the other hand, caters to the entire family with games like Mask of the Pharaoh, Leo Goes to the Barber, and Tricky Wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each crate will be $49.99 (plus shipping) with new crates showing up at your doorstep every 3 months. The first round of crates are expected to ship in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Adventure Guild Polyhedral Dice Box</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/AdventureGuildLLC&quot;&gt;The Adventure Guild&lt;/a&gt; sent us over a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/519956971/white-ash-wood-polyhedral-dice-box-for?ref=shop_home_active_2&quot;&gt;Polyhedral Dice Box&lt;/a&gt; for review! These handmade dice boxes come in a variety of wood materials and engraving and inlay options. Before I get to the details, let’s take a look at the box itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/adventureguild/pdb1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Guild Polyhedral Dice Box&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/adventureguild/pdb2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Guild Polyhedral Dice Box&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/adventureguild/pdb3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Guild Polyhedral Dice Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white ash dice box ($45.95) is sporting a custom Celtic knot engraving, with a 7-dice inlay, and an additional engraved message under the lid. Every order comes with a free under-the-lid message, however, the additional Celtic knot engraving on the lid exterior will cost you an additional $7. Currently, the Adventure Guild offers a number of engraved exterior images: bear, Celtic knot, crossed swords, dragon, howling wolf, kite shield, paw print, shield and sword, and skull. There are also three options for your dice slots: open center (no slots), 2 slots (two d20s), or 7 slots (d4, d6, d8, two d10s, d12, and d20). These dice boxes also have a magnetic lid to prevent unwanted spills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these dice boxes are pricey (there are certainly cheaper options on the market) and take 2-3 weeks to ship out, they represent a certain level of craftsmanship worthy of the price. They make fine gifts for a gamer friend or yourself. If you are willing to spend, the Adventure Guild offers a number of more exotic wood choices: cocobolo ($80.95), purpleheart ($65.95), African blackwood ($145), and bubinga ($75.95). They look nice, on the shelf, or, on your tabletop during gameplay. Additionally, these dice boxes are smooth and slim and slide nicely into your backpack or bag for travel. If you are in the market for a new dice box, the Adventure Guild is worth a moment of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Harvest Moon Lil' Farmers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/harvestmoon/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Harvest Moon Lil Farmers&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daredevil-development.com&quot;&gt;Daredevil Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.risingstargames.com/us/&quot;&gt;Rising Star Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/harvest-moon-lil-farmers/id1217852561?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dareDev.HarvestMoon&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $3.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Harvest Moon series of games has been entertaining players since 1996 with its combination of farming, building, and relationship dynamics. Throughout the years there has been a multitude of family-friendly Harvest Moon games, but none specifically aimed at preschoolers. Harvest Moon Lil’ Farmers changes all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional Harvest Moon games have the player take control of a fledgling farm and have them turn it into a thriving business, offering upgrade options, relationships with in-game characters, and, in the case of the Rune Factory spin-offs, RPG, and combat elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lil’ Farmers takes the core aspect of Harvest Moon, farming, and creates a playset for young children to care and manage a small farm on their own. The game is language independent, using only simple icons and touch controls to let little ones grow crops, gather eggs, sheer sheep, clean horses, and milk cows to satisfy the needs of the farm store customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each activity in Lil’ Farmers is broken down into several simple steps that are easy for little fingers to perform. Onscreen guides are always available to steer actions in the right direction, though the game is open to kids to explore and choose activities as they desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest Moon Lil’ Farmers doesn’t have a story or an end. It’s simply a playset where children complete the same actions in a loop to their heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest Moon games are known for their cute graphics and overall charm. Lil’ Farmers is no exception. Everything in the game is illustrated perfectly for preschool children with large graphics and bright colors. The music is friendly, catchy, and compliments play well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/harvestmoon/screens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lil' Farmers Screens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest Moon Lil’ Farmers is an excellent app, hands down. My own little guy took right to it, quickly figuring out his favorite activities to perform then easily repeating them. The game is ad-free, micro-transaction free, and perfectly safe for a little one to play without worry. At $4, it’s an excellent deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the gameplay may seem repetitive and simple, you need to keep in mind that this game is meant for &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; young children. Lil’ Farmers has the perfect level of interactivity while keeping each individual activity short, entertaining, and easy to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rare that I find a children’s app that really has any lasting appeal. Harvest Moon Lil’ Farmers is an exception to this, and a wonderful addition to my child’s app library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Android copy of Harvest Moon Lil’ Farmers was provided free for review by Rising Star Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Savage Planet</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right; margin-left: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/imphouse/savage-planet-the-fate-of-fantos/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Imp House, LLC launched Savage Planet on Kickstarer, a semi-cooperative tableau-building game with some &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; artwork. We’re talking 80’s fantasy style…my &lt;strong&gt;favorite&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savage Planet has each player taking control of a city-state in the world of game’s world of Fantos. Over the course of the game they try to build up their Citadel and earn the favor of Zodraz, a Cosmic Warden. If you couldn’t tell their be some lore to the game, that last sentance should give you a good hint. Every character in the game has some sort of history, coming from one of six races. There’s a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imphouse.com/savage-planet-design-log-welcome-to-fantos-2/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Imp House’s site detailing the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway! The game looks pretty awesome, boasting multiple paths to victory, unique mechanics, and highly interactive rounds. If you’re looking to actually take a peek you can download a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ph4f4s9hdntzhy/SP_FOF_PNP.zip?dl=0&quot;&gt;print-and-play&lt;/a&gt; version of the game to give it a shot before you pledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not into the whole print-and-play thing you can still view the current rulebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/3nhbfalh08i7ss4/SP_FOF_RB_V5_LR.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savage Planet is already funded and working through their stretch goals. A $30 pledge will get you the game and all the unlocked goals once the campaign ends. It’s the only pledge level, so it’s nice and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Privateer Press' June Releases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once outlawed as a dangerous and radical sect of extremists, the Retribution of Scyrah has become the last shining beacon of hope for the elves of Ios. The Retribution is convince that by elimination the spread of magic among humans, it can halt the slow demise of the elves’ last remaining gods and save their race from soulless oblivion. The Retribution’s weapons and its warjacks, called myrmidons, harness the power of arcanika and tap powers undreamed of by the other nations of the Iron Kingdoms. Led by warcasters drawn together from the numerous houses and martial disciplines of Ios, the army of the Retribution represents undeniable peril to any who would dare threaten the Iosan people or the elven nation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of Privateer Press’ June releases, the Retribution of Scyrah gets a big boost. Take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/ppjune1.png&quot; alt=&quot;WARMACHINE: Retribution of Scyrah Softcover&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/ppjune2.png&quot; alt=&quot;WARMACHINE: Retribution of Scyrah Softcover&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, bright, big, vivid color literature details the stat specifics for the command. Shown here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/books/retribution-of-scyrah-command&quot;&gt;PIP 1086 Forces of WARMACHINE: Retribution of Scyrah Softcover&lt;/a&gt;. This book ($34.99) features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete rules and profiles for the deadly warcasters and sleek myrmidons of the Retribution of Scyrah, including two new warcasters and a new character warjack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of units and solos that can form the flexible core of your Retribution army.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detailed background information on the Retribution and Ios, including an in-depth look at their warcasters and myrmidons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A painting guide full of tips and inspiration to help you create an army as individual as you are.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three new theme forces that allow you to create specialized Retribution armies with specific benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/ppjune3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ryssovass Defenders - Retribution of Scyrah Unit&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nyss ryssovass were once proud defenders of the winding mountain passes of the Shard Spires. Having lost their sense of purpose after so many of their order were corrupted by Everblight, the remaining ryssovass relocated to Ios alongside their fellow refugees, where their frozen god is protected. They do not hesitate to join the Retribution of Scyrah in battle, seeing this as part of their sacred responsibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/retribution-of-scyrah/units/ryssovass-defenders&quot;&gt;PIP 35079 Ryssovass Defenders - Retribution of Scyrah Unit (plastic)&lt;/a&gt; is really exciting. Set to release on June 28, 2017, this kit ($54.99) includes 10 30mm base, detailed plastic models—an uncommon release for Privateer Press. The Ryssovass Defenders boast Tough and Weapon Master alongside a moderate 10/16 point cost. When led to battle by Aelyth Vyr (PIP 35086), these grim Nyss swordsmen become the bane of enemy cavalry, gaining Hard. The Ryssovass pair great with warcasters like Dawnlord Vyros (PIP 35001) and Thyron, Sword of Truth (PIP 35064).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/ppjune4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hemera - Retribution of Scyrah Character Warjack&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Designed for Issyria’s exclusive use and fitted with experimental technology that includes a cutting-edge arc node, Hemera magnifies the warcaster’s arcane abilities. The myrmidon wades into the thick of combat to take Issyria’s place, allowing her to guide the flow of combat more effectively without putting herself in harm’s way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/retribution-of-scyrah/warjacks/hemera&quot;&gt;PIP 35081 Hemera - Retribution of Scyrah Character Warjack (resin/metal)&lt;/a&gt;. Also scheduled for a June 28th release, this 50mm base Heavy Warjack ($54.99), is equipped with an Empowered Arc Node ability, making it an ideal warjack for spellslinging warcasters like Adeptis Rahn (PIP 35002), while its Mark Target ability makes it a favorite of Lord Arcanist Ossyan (PIP 35046) and Ravyn, Eternal Light (PIP 35004). When paired with its bonded warcaster Issyria, Sybil of Dawn (PIP 35058), Hemera provides its favored warcaster with a free upkeep in addition to its numerous other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Items provided free for review. You can find the full release schedule &lt;a href=&quot;http://privateerpress.com/support/retailers/release-schedule&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Metal Dawn</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/everythingepicgames/metal-dawn/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal Dawn, a game about fighting robots in Washington D.C., just funded today with 8 days left in its campaign. Everything Epic, publishers of Big Trouble in Little China, set out to create a game with simple mechanics that evoked the feel of Terminator, 24, and Reagan’s “Star Wars” initiative. The game features wonderful, 80’s era, sci-fi art with some designs that may feel a bit familiar (I’m looking at you, agent-that-looks-like-GI-Joe-Baroness.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A $60 pledge will get you a copy of the game. A $79 pledge will get you the Kickstarter Deluxe version that includes the base game plus more weapons, missions, gear, agents, and zones. It also includes an optional new game mode with an area control mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any Kickstarter, there’s a slew of stretch goals to be unlocked. For more information head on over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/everythingepicgames/metal-dawn&quot;&gt;campaign page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Geek Chic Ceases Operations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekchichq.com/&quot;&gt;Geek Chic&lt;/a&gt;, the manufacturer of some of the best board game tables out there, announced today that they are ceasing all operations. They posted this image on their Facebook page a little bit ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/geekchic/chic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Geek Chic Apology&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been no details given at this point, but the rumormill has been working over time. Once I have some hard facts I’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also been no word on the what’s going to happen with any orders already in process, deposits made, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame to see them close their doors. They were an awesome company with some great people working for them. Geek Chic tables are still some of the most amazing board game tables out there, with a craftsmanship meant to last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $19.99 (Console), $14.99 (Steam)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something strange is happening in the forest. As a spirit pulled from the earth and bonded with a fox you must figure out what’s going on. The Guardians of the Seasons will impart seasonal magic to you, allowing you to change the season at will to better traverse the world you inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seasons After Fall opens with the player controlling a sprit in a dimly lit…something. A soothing voice beckons the spirit and it makes its way up to the world above. Once there, the narrator introduces the spirit to a Fox that it’s about to be bound to. Once in a physical body, the player is sent to find the Guardians of the Seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control of the Fox is simple, though a bit clunky. The fox can run, jump, and bark. Jumping is a bit delayed, which gets a bit frustrating in a platforming game. More on this at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the game, the ability to change the Seasons opens up. As the Seasons change, they affect the world around you. In the Winter water is frozen, while Spring’s rain raises water levels. Summer causes plants to grow and extend, and Fall causes mushroom platforms to open up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gotten past the Prologue you’re set loose in the forest to solve puzzles, platform in Metroidvania fashion, and solve the mysteries of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seasons After Fall oozes with beauty and charm with its hand-painted graphics and string quartet music. The world is lavishly detailed and moves in such a fluid way that it’s hard to take your eyes from the screen. The fantasy, almost alien landscape changes with each Season. Vivid whites, blues, purples, pinks, greens, oranges, and more pull you into each Season as the landscape reacts to the effects that they bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music blends into the game so well that at times you don’t even know its there. It swells and calms in all the right places creating either a frantic or serene feel depending on the action, or inaction, happening around the little Fox. It’s a soundtrack that holds its own while blending so perfectly into the entire experience of play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ON2QHzJsJEc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to love about Seasons After Fall. It’s beauty, it’s music, it’s strangely compelling narrative. The puzzles in the game aren’t too hard, yet require a bit of thought to get through on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the experience is very relaxing. Chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is marred by a few things, though. One is the clunky controls I mentioned before. Jumping feels a bit lagged, and that’s not a great thing in a platformer that requires such precise jumps.  A lot of these jumps also require a running jump, which is extremely frustrating to pull off until you’ve finally mastered the delay in controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem is all the backtracking that needs to be done in the game. You constantly need to retrace your steps and visit the same locations over and over again. This becomes a bit more of a pain because there’s no map or directional markers of any kind. If you don’t have a mind for directions, Seasons After Fall might be a very difficult game for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, the game is fairly solid. The story is quirky,  the world beautiful, and the music outstanding. I can’t recommend passing it up for those who love a pretty game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Nevera Wars</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; Daniel Bishop&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigercrabstudios.com/p/necromancer-card-game.html&quot;&gt;Tiger Crab Studios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 20-40 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 13+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; No&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiger Crab Studios &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/563979601/nevera-tales&quot;&gt;successfully funded&lt;/a&gt; a 20-page, black and white, horror comic book, titled Nevera Tales, back in June of 2016. Coming this summer they’ll be launching a new campaign for card games set in the same universe called Nevera Wars. The game has players taking control of necromancers and battling horrific creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevera Wars is a deck constructing, card battling game for 2-4 players. Each player creates a deck of 36 Minion cards that can be summoned to the table, with the goal of defeating and taking a set number of other players’ creatures. This is done by placing Resources, summoning Minions, and using Minions’ attacks and abilities to slowly break down your opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summoning Minions and using their abilities costs Resources. Once per turn a player can play any card from their hand face-down on the table to use as a Resource. As Resources are used they’re turned sideways to show they’ve been spent, turning upright again at the start of that player’s next turn. If a player has enough Resources they may summon one Minion to the table, having up to a max of three on the table at one time. Every Minion can then use one of their abilities as long as enough Resources are left available to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minions can also be upgraded during play by summoning more powerful Minions that build off their weaker, base Minions. Pretty much every Minion in the game has three forms, their base form plus two upgrades. The father along the upgrade path a Minion is, the more powerful its abilities and the more hit points it has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until one player has defeated and taken whatever set number of Minions that is required is met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neverawars/shadow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shadow&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
The copy of Nevera Wars I received was a very early prototype that came in two plain white deck boxes. That being said, the cards were pretty high quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I can comment on is the amazing artwork in the game. It’s dark, brooding, and hauntingly morbid without being gory of violent. The layout of the cards can use a bit of work. They’re very text heavy, but need to be so since every Minion carries a slew of abilities printed directly on their card. I couldn’t comment on a fix, but I can say it’s a bit overwhelming to look at a card, especially as a new player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health trackers for each Minion are two cards placed one over the other. The base card has numbers, while the top card has two holes on it to show the health number to both players, supposedly making each Minion’s health level to both players at a quick glance. They’re clunky, and while I get the idea behind them, they don’t work as well as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevera Wars feels a bit like a cross between Magic: The Gathering and the Pokemon TCG while keeping the flow of tempo of the gaming moving along by streamlining the Resource building by allowing players to use any cards as a Resource. Each Minion having a large set of abilities also saves on having to use separate cards for spells, counters, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the time it takes to get Minions out on the table is decreased drastically by this, the game still feels a bit slow and doesn’t really pick up until some upgraded Minions start hitting the table. Also, while every Minion has a good amount of abilities on their card, only one or two really feel very effective, the rest being able to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevera Wars is still being worked on, with a Kickstarter starting this Summer. There’s still plenty of time for the game to change. There’s a really great game in there. It just needs a bit more polish before really being something to get excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d keep my eye on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype copy of Nevera Wars was provided free for preview by Tiger Crab Studios. It was returned to them after play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Petting Zoo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pettingzoo/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Petting Zoo&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; William Burke (II)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; Self Published&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2019&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2s9NX9h&quot;&gt;$28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 20-60 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 8+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/138268/petting-zoo-rules&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/206153/petting-zoo&quot;&gt;Petting Zoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petting Zoo is described as a card drafting grid building game for 2-3 players. It’s a cute little game about setting up a petting zoo, though under it’s cute exterior lies something a bit deeper. Self-published by William Burke (II) last year, Petting Zoo is a bit hard to get your hands on. It had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1377615834/petting-zoo-card-drafting-grid-building-2-4-player?ref=user_menu&quot;&gt;failed Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, and there hasn’t been much news about a relaunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pettingzoo/pettingzoo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Petting Zoo&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;The basics of Petting Zoo are fairly simple. Each turn a player will roll a die to enter their zoo and try to earn coins. Coins can be used to buy more cards to add to your grid. Each card earns you coins and can have varying effects on gameplay. The game ends when one of each of the four victory cards are purchased and added to a player’s zoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petting Zoo only takes moments to learn but possesses more depth than an initial glance would provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your turn, you can keep rolling the die to move to cards on your grid as long as you keep making successful moves. To move to a card you must be adjacent to it and have rolled a number listed in the card’s range. Some cards will allow you to move diagonally or jump straight to their cards no matter when they are in your grid, but orthogonally is the general rule. As you move around your zoo you’ll either earn coins or steal them from other players. The smarter you lay out your grid the more likely you’ll be able to continue the movement and rack up coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more coins you can earn, the better. Each of the four victory cards increases drastically in price. Of course, each card also is extremely powerful to have in your zoo. It may be worth saving for the most expensive card to get it’s power, though even the cheapest one still offers a great advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petting Zoo features 3 wooden pawns, 3 wooden dice, a flimsy rulebook, and the square cards you’ll be using throughout the game. The cards are sturdy, but nothing spectacular. The artwork and box design are fairly bland, featuring just enough to get the theme of the game across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petting Zoo provides a satisfying game experience with a lot more choice and depth than meets the eye. At first, the game may seem a bit too random with few cards in your grid and have to rely on the luck of the die to move. Once you figure out how to lay out your grid to maximize your changes to move you come to realize how many options are open to you any given turn.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - PlayTape</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InRoad Toys was kind enough to send over some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inroadtoys.com/classic-road-series-black-30-x-2.html&quot;&gt;2” Classic Road Series PlayTape&lt;/a&gt; along with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inroadtoys.com/classic-road-series-tight-curve-2-wide.html&quot;&gt;2” Tight Curves&lt;/a&gt; for my kids and me to play with. PlayTape is a removable tape with roads, tracks, or even Hot Wheels branded track printed on it. InRoad Toys has a variety of different products in the line for every scale toy car or train found in toy stores today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play &amp;amp; Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PlayTape roads and rails are pretty self-explanatory. They’re roads and tracks that you can stick just about anywhere! The various sizes are good for various size toys and provide an almost limitless flexibility. Run them across the floor, up the walls, or even create ramps or bridges by spanning the tape between objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tape, a paper tape that’s very similar to painter’s tape, is toxin-free, disposable, and recyclable. It’s easy to tear, which means the kiddos won’t need scissors to play with it. PlayTape leaves no residue on surfaces it’s stuck on and is even repositionable to a point. It’s also pretty durable and resists tearing even with rough play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/playtape/playtape.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PlayTape Classic Road Series&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PlayTape is one of those products that you wonder why it hadn’t been thought of before. It’s such a simple toy that can provide hours of fun. The price doesn’t break the bank, either. Each roll of the 2” tape I was sent costs around $9, while the curves $5. Of course, price varies with color, size, and length of the roll of tape. If you’ve got a kid who enjoys playing with cars, PlayTape is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few rolls and packs of curves of PlayTape were provided free for review by InRoad Toys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/188225/rone&quot;&gt;Rone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Štěpán Štefaník has launched his Kickstarter for the 2nd edition of Rone – the post-apocalyptic strategy card game for 2 to 4 players. This Kickstarter includes not only the 2nd edition of the core game, but also the re-launch of the New Forces expansion deck. In anticipation of the launch, we were lucky enough to get our hands on a review copy of the core game and Rone: Awakening, Rone’s first expansion deck. First, let’s take a look at what is included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rone/rone1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rone&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rone/rone2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rone&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rone/rone3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rone&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rone/rone4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core set includes 156 cards, 40 tokens, 4 water resource dials (one for each player), and 1 color rulebook. Additionally, the expansion Rone: Awaking includes 100 cards and the newest expansion Rone: New Forces includes another 99 cards. The materials are top quality. The printing is bright and vivid on thick cards. The rulebook contains large print and full-color images on glossy pages and the tokens are thick-cut. Each dial must be assembled before play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player controls a hero and plays units or one-time effects (tactics) in an attempt to destroy all cards from her opponent’s deck. The number of cards in the deck and the player’s hand is connected to the number of health points of the player’s hero. For each point of damage that the hero receives, the player has to destroy one of their cards – from the top of their deck or from their hand. Once a player loses all cards from their deck and hand they lose the game. Because each card used by a player during the game costs them a life point, players are forced to play cards as efficiently as possible so that each played card does more damage to the enemy than to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players earn resources to spend on various abilities throughout the game and these resources are counted using each player’s water resource dial. Being a post-apocalyptic setting, water is a fitting resource. Rone certainly succeeds in immersing the players into a sci-fi post-annihilation landscape of death, despair, and destruction. This stylistic immersion really adds to the distinctiveness of this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rone’s straight-forward mechanics and extremely user-friendly rulebook make this game approachable and easy to digest for most gamers. By using level-up mechanics, Rone blends RPG qualities into a modern strategy deck builder. It did not take long before I was hooked. If you are looking for a Kickstarter to get behind, this game is worth come consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $19.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world constantly flooded by rain, a slugcat and its family are separated. The journey to be reunited with them is through a hostile world filled with predators, a changing environment, lack of food, and, of course, floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Rain World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rain World, you control a slugcat, which is a lot cuter than it sounds. Slugcat has a basic set of controls that include basic movement, jumping, eating, and throwing. More advanced moves like pouncing, rolling, wall jumping, and more are learned throughout the game as you experiment with navigating the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic goal of the game is to find slugcat’s family while staying alive. Everything in Rain World is out to get you. Various predators prowl the world while your own hunger eats away at you. Slugcat can throw items like rocks, spears, but can really only hold predators at bay. Food is plentiful towards the start of the game but comes increasing rare as you progress.  As if all this weren’t enough, there’s always the threat of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain Cat includes a rain clock that lets you know how long until the next rain storm comes and floods the world. As you go on you’ll be able to pick up on visual and audio clues so you don’t have to rely on the clock as much. Slugcat needs to find shelter before it rains and must have at least 4 units of food to survive its slumber through the storm. This makes finding food early on important, and eventually, leads to taking much bigger risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain World’s biggest strength is its audio and visuals. The world, while often dangerous and unforgiving, is beautifully illustrated in highly detailed pixel art. Slugcat and everything else living is animated using a physics engine that gives everything a strange sense of life. Creatures scramble, stumble, fall, and rest in an eerily lifelike way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is eerie and fitting to the dark world, but it’s the little details like the audio cues of predators and rain that truly immerse players into slugcat’s survival experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain World is a game best played in the dark with the volume turned up, or with headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/undefined&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain World is brutal. There’s no other word for it. The game gives you very little direction through its introductory tutorial beyond the very basic controls and objectives of the game. It’s up to the player to figure out how to move the initially clumsy feeling slugcat, deal with predators, and find their way through the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game can initially be very frustrating as slugcat meets a variety of environmental and predatory deaths. Not only that, but each section of the environment changes every time it rains, so what you knew to expect before the storm won’t hold true once slugcat awakes from slumber. Food, while available in plentiful quantities at first, becomes more and more scarce. While you may survive your waking hours, you may starve in your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rainworld/fluid.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Fluid Motion&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Everything is so fluid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you can accept the fact that you’re going to die, a lot, the game opens up and reveals what a joy it really is. Slugcat eventually feels more graceful and you run, jump, swing, and speed through the various screens. Predators, while still dangerous, become a bit more manageable as you learn how to best trip them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Rain World is a very satisfying experience. The difficult learning curve can be forgiven by the game’s ambient beauty and rewarding gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Snap Dice</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/5toclose/snapdice-worlds-first-magnetic-dice-rolling-tray/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new Kickstarter campaign has been launched for Snap Dice, a set of metal dice and a hardwood tray with a rare earth magnet strip at the back. Unlike most dice trays, this one only has 3 sides allowing you to throw dice easily into it. The metal dice tumble then snap onto the magnetic strip at the back of the tray, locking in your roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each die is steel and perfectly balanced within .001mm of center and nickel plated. The tray itself comes in 8 different hardwoods of varying cost: Hickory, Jatoba, Paduck, Wendge, Bubinga, Purple Heart, Zebrawood, and Quilted Maple. Costs range from $129 to $249. Of course, there are varying degrees of customization on the trays and dice. You can get regular or polyhedral dice, tray inlays, dovetailed joints, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see everything, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/5toclose/snapdice-worlds-first-magnetic-dice-rolling-tray?token=155960a7&quot;&gt;check out the project&lt;/a&gt;. There’s still a while to go in the project which means there’s plenty of time to get your pledge in and make sure you get exactly what you want when the project funds. I’m really looking forward to getting my hands on one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Verraro Dungeon Tiles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the opportunity to receive a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/531263101/verraro-deluxe-dungeon-set-low-profile?ref=shop_home_active_2&quot;&gt;Verraro Deluxe Dungeon Set&lt;/a&gt; for review. This tile set is perfect for crafting your own maps for role-playing tabletop games. The Deluxe Set ($131.97) comes with a large assortment of tiles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 - 3x3 Passage Cross Intersection
2 - 3x3 Passage Tee Intersection
2 - 3x3 Passage Corner
2 - 3x3 Passage Dead End
2 - 3x2 Alcove
4 - 3x3 Passage Way
2 - 3x6 Passage Way
1 - 3x3 Dungeon Left Entrance
1 - 3x3 Dungeon Center Entrance
1 - 3x3 Dungeon Right Entrance
4 - 3x3 Dungeon Wall
4 - 3x3 Dungeon Corner
4 - 3x6 Dungeon Wall
1 - 6x6 Dungeon Floor
2 - 3x6 Dungeon Floor
2 3x3 Dungeon Floor
2 - Simple Wooden Door
1 - Ornate Wooden Door
1 - Strong Wooden Door&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/verraro/dt1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Verraro Dungeon Tiles&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/verraro/dt2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Verraro Dungeon Tiles&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/verraro/dt3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Verraro Dungeon Tiles&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/verraro/dt4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Verraro Dungeon Tiles&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/verraro/dt5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Verraro Dungeon Tiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tiles are handmade, laser-cut, wooden tiles. They are perfect for 25mm to 32mm scale models and games. Each tile is cut from thick material and makes an excellent platform for your miniatures. Notably, each tile’s grid aligns perfectly with adjacent tiles, enabling maximum use of the set. I routinely take notice of stylistics and this tile set certainly has a unique artistic flair. The wall pieces are finished with a stonework design and the three unique door pieces undoubtedly add an impressive level of detail to the set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest downside of this set is its high price. However, this is fairly common with dungeon tile sets, especially resin or 3D-printed sets. In fact, many other sets on the market can be shockingly pricy in comparison. Additionally, if you are looking for a 3D walled dungeon tile set, than this primarily 2D set is likely not for you. Despite the cost, this is a great, quality dungeon tile set that is compatible with many role-playing and dungeon crawler tabletop games. As usual, in the gaming industry, you get what you pay for. This is no exception and I would recommend this set without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Pokémon Games on the Way</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemon/PTDX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pokken Tournament DX&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
During today’s Pokémon Direct presentation, The Pokémon Company announced the latest Pokémon titles for Nintendo consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first item is Pokémon’s first foray onto the Nintendo Switch with Pokkén Tournament DX. This updated version of the popular Pokémon fighting game will contain all the content from the Wii U title, along with Decidueye as a playable character, new support Pokémon, Team Battle mode, Group Match mode, daily challenges, and more. All characters will be unlocked and available to play right from the start of the game. There will also be a new replay feature that allows players to share their best matches online. Pokkén Tournament DX will launch on Nintendo Switch September 22, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemon/ultrasunmoon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pokemon Ultra Sun &amp;amp; Moon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is Pokémon Ultra Sun and Pokémon Ultra Moon. New forms of both Solgaleo and Lunala were shown, but no additional info on them was given. Pokémon Ultra Sun and Pokémon Ultra Moon are described as “powered up” new editions of the titled with new additions to the story and new features. Worldwide release will be November 17, 2017, with more information coming later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemon/goldsilver.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pokemon Gold and Silver&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
Last, but certainly not least, will be the release Pokémon Gold &amp;amp; Silver on the Nintendo Virtual Console. Similar to Red, Blue, and Yellow, the games will be presented in their original forms with the added ability to trade over wireless and connect to the Pokémon Bank. Both titles will be available on September 22, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall we’re getting 5 “new” titles that I’m fairly excited about. I haven’t played Sun or Moon yet, so the Ultimate versions are certainly on my radar for the end of the year. Pokkén Tournament certainly needed some of the updates it’s getting to stay fresh. A quick port of the Switch seems like a smart move to bring Switch users over to the franchise. As for Gold &amp;amp; Silver on the VC? That was a no-brainer. I’m sure we’ll continue to see the older games released in this fashion so new Pokémon players can get a feel of the series’ roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still. A mainline Pokémon game for the Switch would have been nice, as would any new entry at all in the series. Those who’ve already purchased Pokémon Sun &amp;amp; Moon might get a bit miffed at having to buy a whole new game for updates instead of a DLC pack. The upgrading of Pokkén Tournament stings a bit less since it’s not like it’s staying on the Wii U, but people have grown to expect a new title to be released on a new system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we know the timeline for Pokémon in 2017. Here’s hoping we’ll get something shiny and new in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Volumes of Blood: Body Count</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/vob.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volumes of Blood: Body Count&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; Josh Lambert and Huskisson &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mythmakergames/&quot;&gt;Mythmaker Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 45-60 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 13+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; No&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mythmaker Games and Blood Moon Pictures’ Kickstarter for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/102978143572732/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%223%22%2C%22ref_newsfeed_story_type%22%3A%22regular%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7D&amp;amp;sharer_id=1695784337305542&quot;&gt;Volumes of Blood: Body Count&lt;/a&gt; launches August 11, 2017. This highly-stylized card game promises to put each player in the director’s chair as they draw location, weapon, killer, and victim cards to construct their own vignette scenes based on the Blood Moon Pictures’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3857092/&quot;&gt;Volumes of Blood&lt;/a&gt; cinematic universe. Mythmaker Games was generous enough to send us a preview copy… and it looks awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/volumesofblood/vob1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volumes of Blood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The box contains a large deck of cards and a short, to-the-point full-color rulebook. The basics of the game are simple. Whenever a director wraps a scene, they get bonus points for how scary the scene is based on the total Fear Value represented on the cards. Those bonus points allow the wrapping director to draw additional cards to set up the next scene. The first director to add three victims to their Body Count wins the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/volumesofblood/vob2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volumes of Blood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork on the cards is excellent. Easy-to-read print and large, color images. The game mechanics are fairly simple and the rulebook was limited, making this game quick to pick up and fun to play. It took us a game or two to really catch on (but, hey, what game doesn’t?). As a horror fan, I found this game to be very cool and as a gamer, I was impressed with its replayability. This is definitely a great game to bring around newbies or less hardcore gamers and it is a great social game or warm up game for a more complex tabletop crawler or euro map strategy. With a flood of card games on the market, there is little separating them. However, Volumes of Blood: Body Count is an exception. I truly hope this game gets funded and then some and will certainly be looking forward to it hitting shelves in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Night Clan</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; Yukinori Ohashi &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamephilia.net/night-clan/&quot;&gt;Gamephilia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 10-20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 14+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4EuZUv5vvB-UzVfS1pPODJJblU/view&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/168549/night-clan&quot;&gt;Night Clan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamephilia has launched Night Clan on Kickstater. Previously released by Domina Games, the Yukinori Ohashi game is a light-weight area-control card game with some amazing art and a quick play time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the game a number of location cards are placed down on the table dicated by the number of players. These are the areas that you’ll play cards down to on your turn. Each player is given an identical deck of 13 cards containing a Troll, Misteltoe, Night Watch cards, Daughters, and Riches. An initial hand of 3 cards is drawn and play begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/nightclan/art.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Night Clan Artwork&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn players place two of their cards down. These are placed, face-down, on any location. Both can go on the same location or each can go on different locations as long as the location’s card-limit hasn’t been reached. There’s one exception to the face-down rule pertaining to Night Watch cards. These are placed face-up and allow a player to move any card from a different location to the location of the Night Watch card played. Location limits still apply. Once cards are placed, new cards are drawn to bring the handsize back up to 3 cards. Play continues until all cards are played then the game is scored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Locations are scored from lowest capacity to highest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player with the most cards on a location scores that location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Points for Daughters and Riches are added up. Subract any points for Night Watch cards to get the total&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trolls negate a location’s scoring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mistletoe negates a single Troll. Multiple Mistletoe can negate multiple Trolls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player with the most points wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night Clan is a quick, simple to learn, and elegant area-control game that’s makes a lot happen with a limited variety of cards. The artwork is moody, yet strikingly beautiful. There’s no word on what the pledge levels will be yet, so I can’t comment much on the price. As my copy is a prototype I also can’t comment on the quality of the game any further than its artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of Night Clan will run you around a $14 pledge. For that price it shouldn’t be passed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype copy of Night Clan was provided free for preview by Gamphilia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/196104/helionox-mercury-protocol&quot;&gt;Helionox: Mercury Protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the distant future, our civilization, spread throughout the solar system, relies on a Solar Lift for power.  Through neglect or sabotage, the Lift is now failing.  Survival is in question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeroic Games and Mr. B Games are set to re-launch their Kickstarter expansion to &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176980/helionox-last-sunset&quot;&gt;Helionox: The Last Sunset&lt;/a&gt; – Mercury Protocol. Helionox is a movement-based science fiction strategy card game set in a shattered solar system. The Mercury Protocol Expansion is completely integrated with the original core set (The Last Sunset). It promises to bring more reasons to travel the solar system, pick fights with nasty events, and deliver much needed cargo to the Interworlds. Additionally, it offers several new card types including four unique ships each with different abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/helionix/helionix1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Helionox: Mercury Protocol&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to get a preview deck of the base core game and the new expansion. First things first, we broke open the original boxed set. I immediately noticed that this highly-stylized game did not disappoint in the artistic department. Each card features stunning futuristic artwork that really helps bring this game to life. I have said it before . . . there has been a recent flood of card games to the Kickstarter universe. With little separating each game, it is difficult for games to emerge as truly unique. Helionox is certainly an exception to this norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/helionix/helionix2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Helionox: Mercury Protocol&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two words: mechanics and art. After wrapping our head around the rules and getting our feet wet with some gameplay, the art really helped to take this game to the next level. One thing I always look for is easy-to-learn rules. Although the mechanics are moderately complicated, it did not take long to grasp the concept of managing game “events” and compiling influence. It was a relief to play a game with a built-in time management system where a finite number of events governs the length of play. Additionally, the game mat really helped to organize and spacially map out gameplay. That being said, as with most games there is certainly a learning curve, you can expect to spend longer than the suggested 45-60 minutes playing your first several games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/helionix/helionix3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Helionox: Mercury Protocol&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helionox: Mercury Protocol is the first stand-alone expansion to Helionox: The Last Sunset. It contains a new set of cards, new planets, and ships that integrate with a pick up and delivery system. Combining it with the original game allows for a 4-player game. Playing several two-player games, we began to get a feel for the value of this expansion. Adding new ships and planets, expands upon the very foundation of the games basic core mechanics. This is a well thought out expansion to a solid card game. If you like stylistic card games or refined science fiction, this game is for you. I certainly have my fingers crossed that this expansion gets funded and will be looking forward to playing it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/220026/norsaga-odds-and-endings&quot;&gt;Norsaga: Odds and Endings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meromorphgames/norsaga-odds-and-endings-expansion/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2015, I had the chance to take a look at Norsaga, a puzzle battle card game where players are Viking poets telling tales of their lineage heroic characters and plenty of embellishments. It’s a fantastic game with brilliant art that can support up to 4 players in less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Meromorph Games has launched a Kickstarter for a new Norsaga expansion called Odds and Endings. 3 new decks of cards add Immortals, Heirlooms, and Realms to the game. Each deck can be used individually, so you don’t always need to play with all 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heirlooms and Immortals are unlockable cards that give players a boost when used. At the start of the game, each player is dealt one card from the deck being used. Heirlooms are unlocked by sacrificing 3 heroes during play but restores your youngest hero’s ability to inherit gives them a second color. This opens up a path to multiple embellishments from then on out. Immortals come in two forms, Guardians and Watchers. These are unlocked by having 3 heroes in your timeline matching the 3 colors on the Immortal card. Guardians can alter the stats of heroes on the board, while Watchers provide free embellishments for players every other turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realms, like Heirlooms and Immortals, are limited to one per player. They can be chosen or dealt randomly, and change the rules of the game for the player that holds them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the new card types drastically changes gameplay and player strategy but does so without adding an excessive amount of complexity. They’re subtle changes that are easy to integrate into the game without much of a second thought. They give players a bit more flexibility, but really don’t change the nature of Norsaga at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a Norsaga fan, as I am, I can’t recommend backing this expansion enough. It’s a minimum pledge of $8 to guarantee you a copy. Pocket change to make an already great game even better. Don’t have Norsaga? Pledge $40 to get a copy of the base game, the Into the Myths expansion, promo cards, and, of course, the Odds and Endings expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t be sorry you did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype copy of Norsaga: Odds and Endings was provided free for preview by Meromorph Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hasbro Reveals Transformers: The Last Knight Figures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Normally I had to do this, but there’s just too much information here. Here’s a dump of all the info and pictures from the latest Hasbro press release revealing the ‘Transformers: The Last Knight’ figures. There’s actually quite a few here in here that aren’t too bad. Much more than I’d expect from the movie-related line of toys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there’s a lot in here that’s just gone way, way wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may have to pick up Megatron and Nitro for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TekCreations Paint Racks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The other week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/TekCreations&quot;&gt;TekCreations&lt;/a&gt; sent over two of their laser-cut paint racks for review. Based out of Perth, Australia, TekCreations specializes in crafting gaming accessories out of medium-density fibreboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tekcreations/tekrack1.png&quot; alt=&quot;TekCreations Model Paint Rack/Holder for Wargame or Miniature Bottle Paints&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first rack pictured ($11.49) is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/269631154/model-paint-rack-holder-for-wargame-or?ref=shop_home_active_4&quot;&gt;Model Paint Rack/Holder for Wargame or Miniature Bottle Paints&lt;/a&gt;. This paint rack, made from 3mm medium-density fibreboard, measures 180mm x 95mm x 105mm and holds 18 Vallejo, Army Painter, or Reaper paint bottles (30 millimeter diameter). Up to 12 paint bottles can be stored upside down to help cycle your paints to keep them from coagulating. Additionally, the rack has 12 holes for brushes. This will hold most style model paintbrushes. However, the holes are not large enough for a larger-handle triangular Army Painter brush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tekcreations/tekrack2.png&quot; alt=&quot;TekCreations Paint Rack Holder for Citadel Warhammer Paints&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second paint rack pictured ($13.79) is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/454291030/paint-rack-holder-for-citadel-warhammer?ref=listing-shop-header-0&quot;&gt;Paint Rack Holder for Citadel Warhammer Paints&lt;/a&gt;. Made from the same 3mm medium-density fibreboard, this rack measures 250mm x 120mm x 55mm and holds up to 18 Citadel (32mm diameter) paint bottles. This paint rack also has 15 slots for brushes. 
These paint rack are great. Because these items ships out of Australia, if you are shipping to the U.S., expect about a two-week turnaround time. The racks required some minor sanding, gluing, and assembly, but nothing too demanding. Once assembled, they function just as intended and help to neaten up and organize your workspace. These low-cost paint racks a definitely a great buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paint racks provided free for review by TekCreations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Kingdoms of Erden</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1835206317/kingdoms-of-erden-king-of-the-mountain-1/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Kickstarter has relaunched!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kingdoms of Erden: King of the Mountain is a fantasy card game currently gearing up for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1835206317/616005693?token=11fb844c&quot;&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a simple and portable game that can be learned in around 2 minutes and plays in as little as 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to win Kingdoms of Erden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Faction Dominance - Reaching an agreed upon value of any single faction in your hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staying Alive - Being the last player who can make a play on their turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup is easy. Shuffle the deck and deal seven cards to each player. A card from the top of the deck is then flipped over and placed in the discard pile. This is the first card the first player needs to defeat. The rest of the cards are placed face down as the reward pile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn a player must play a card or be knocked out of the game. The game contains two types of cards, Faction Cards and Wild Cards. Cards, with a few exceptions, are played to the discard pile. A card can be placed onto the discard pile if it’s, in most cases, a higher number and different color Faction. Wild Cards can be played on anything except a Wild Card. Some cards also have special abilities that are triggered when played. A few cards can actually beat a higher numbered card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a card is played the player three cards are drawn from the deck and keeps one, placing the other two back. Play then passes to the next player. Play continues until one of the two victory conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cards in Kingdoms of Erden are a thick, glossy stock. They feel &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; nice. The artwork is pretty standard medieval fantasy with each faction having its own distinct visual design. I can’t really comment on much more since this is a prototype, but the way things are looking now the game components should be top notch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kingdomsorerden/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kingdoms of Erden Cover&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
Overall Kingdoms of Erden: King of the Mountain is a simple, yet entertaining card game. It’s small footprint and simple ruleset makes it very accessible and portable. The two paths to victory help provide enough variety in players’ turns to keep the game interesting, without feeling like there are no meaningful choices to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;My only concern with the game is its $15 pledge level to get a print copy of the game without a box. $20 if you want a box with the game. While the game is enjoyable, a $10 tag seems a bit more reasonable for a boxed game with 36 cards.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I’ve been informed that the Kickstarter campaign has been updated. You can now get Kingdoms of Erden, and all stretch goals, for $10. At this price point you’d be crazy to pass it up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, Kingdoms of Erden is a light and quick filler that’s playable up to 4 players in a reasonable amount of time. While the game comes with a 10+ age rating, it’s certainly playable with younger kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype copy of Kingdoms of Erden was provided free for preview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Metalfest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/metalfest.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Metalfest&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt; Daniel Hendlowitch&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://danwichgames.com&quot;&gt;Danwich Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 60 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; No&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/196642/metalfest-card-game&quot;&gt;Metalfest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your favorite aunt has just given you $200. What do you do? Start a metal band, of course! It’s 3 days until the big metalfest and you need to put together the best band, the biggest gimmicks, and have the best merch in time to rack in the big bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metalfest will be hitting Kickstarter soon and is currently up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://prefundia.com/projects/view/metalfest-the-tables-of-merch/6942/&quot;&gt;Prefundia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/metalfest/singer.png&quot; alt=&quot;Metalfest Singer&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
At its heart, Metalfest is a card drafting game. Each round you’ll be drafting band members and gimmicks to try and put together a group that’ll attract the right crowds to buy your merch and build up your fanbase. There’s different crowds, each with their likes and quirks. Cater to the crowd well over 3 rounds and you’ll bring in the most cash and win the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most cards in Metalfest do double duty. Unused Band Members and Gimmicks are used for Merch value, while Fans both supply a fanbase and have a max capacity for buying your wares. This means there’s very little waste, allowing you to tailor your turns to best maximize your income and popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central Showmanship track allows each band to track their stats that their members provide. Vocals, solos, rhythm, imagery, and brutality make up the core of your metal band. Fans of different factions, Metalheads, Nerds, Hipsters, Goths, and Bros, all have their own tastes and will flock to bands that cater to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a tough balance making sure you put together a solid band, attract the right crowds, and sell as much as you can. Certain fans are picky, and some will even scorn you if you’re the biggest and best. The Non-Conformists and Underdogs will intentionally head towards smaller bands, even if they don’t really fit in with their own likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the game you add up all the Merch you’ve sold, fans you’ve earned, and Band Members you’ve recruited to see who’s the overall victor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a prototype, it’s hard to judge Metalfest on its components. So far the artwork is looking excellent, and certainly fits the theme of the game well. Iconography is clear and the overall layout of the cards makes it very easy to see what each does at a quick glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell what the final product will end up looking like. There’s not much to go on so far, as the Kickstarter hasn’t even launched yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metalfest delivered exactly what I was hoping for when I first heard about the game. Something that last year’s Lords of Rock fell a bit flat on. Between the card drafting, art, multiple choices and uses for cards, the game delivers a satisfying experience with plenty of different paths to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming in at around 60 minutes, Metalfest isn’t just filler. While it’s easy to pick up the rules and play the game provides something a bit deeper than it may look like at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a game that certainly warrants a close eye. You can sign up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://prefundia.com/projects/view/metalfest-the-tables-of-merch/6942/&quot;&gt;Prefundia page&lt;/a&gt; to be notified when the Kickstarter project launches. I’m very interested to see where the price point for the game falls, what stretch goals there’ll be, and how everything overall looks and feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype copy of Metalfest was provided free for preview by Danwich Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hazelnut Bastille Public Demo Released</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aloft Studio has just announced the release of the public demo for their game, Hazelnut Bastille. Access to the demo can be obtained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aloftstudio.com/&quot;&gt;signing up for their newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to come across Hazelnut Bastille when someone retweeted the release of Aloft’s demo yesterday. I was instantly intersted after seeing the retro SNES-inspired graphics and immediately set out to find out more about the game. It’s a topdown adventure game similar to A Link to the Past, but has Metroidvania elements to its level design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aloft boasts an impressive list of features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heavily conscientious level design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Metroidvania progression&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Classic open-world Overworld and Dungeon format&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;16-bit graphic and audio style&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8-voice Chiptune and lofi sample soundtrack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Classic 4-way character navigation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enemy design invoking original Legend of Zelda principles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intense, brutal bosses which require learning and observation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highly challenging combat sequences with a high skill ceiling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Puzzles built around observation, item use, and sequential logic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complex trading system to obtain optional items&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customizable playstyle based on which items player obtains and equips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every one of those bullet points resonates with me. I’m currently downloading the demo build as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazelnut Bastille is set to release early-2018 for PC / Mac / Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hazelnutbastille/hb1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Hazelnut Bastille Screen&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/images/hazelnutbastille/hb2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Hazelnut Bastille Screen&quot; /&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Gruff: Rage of the Trolls</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/31839895/gruff-rage-of-the-trolls/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just launched on Kickstarter today. Gruff: Rage of the Trolls is the 3rd product in the Gruff line. The first two, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/31839895/gruff-the-tactical-card-game-of-mutated-monster-go?ref=user_menu&quot;&gt;Gruff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/31839895/clash-of-the-battle-goats?ref=user_menu&quot;&gt;Clash of the Battle Goats&lt;/a&gt;, both had successful Kickstarter campaigns in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with Gruff, it’s a card battling game where players take control of a shepherd and mutated goats. It’s a unique game where actions and attacks don’t always take place as soon as you play them, most of the time resolving during your opponent’s turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely one of my favorite card battle games of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rage of the Trolls, like the two sets before it, is a standalone game that can be combined with the other sets for more flexibility and customizability. The difference here is that Rage of the Trolls adds co-op and solo gameplay options, having players face off against a Troll that follows a set of rules for automated turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the new co-op mode is cool, it still takes a back seat in my mind to the classic Gruff gameplay. The new shepherds and goats are more exciting to me than the trolls, but the ability to play solo now means I can play one of my favorite cards games anytime I please, just as long as I have a deck and a troll set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans of Gruff should most certainly pick up Rage of the Trolls. New to the game? I’d still snag it but would recommend Clash of the Battle Goats as your introductory set into the world of hideously mutant goats and their insane handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gruff: Rage of the Trolls is almost fully funded, so make sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/31839895/gruff-rage-of-the-trolls&quot;&gt;pledge at least $25&lt;/a&gt; to make sure get your copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype copy of Gruff: Rage of the Trolls was provided free for preview by Studio Woe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Embers of Mirrim</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/embersofmirrim/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Embers of Mirrim&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://embersofmirrim.com&quot;&gt;Creative Bytes Studios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://embersofmirrim.com&quot;&gt;Creative Bytes Studios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/596080/Embers_of_Mirrim/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/embers-of-mirrim/cid=UP0190-CUSA07552_00-MIRRIMGAMEPS4000&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/p/Embers-of-Mirrim/BQ925ZLV26LQ?rtc=1&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $19.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great calamity has started to corrupt the world. Two warring factions of creatures, one of the light embers, one of dark, are literally forced together to restore balance to a dying land. Use the powers of both creatures, split into two different embers, solve puzzles, and cleanse the corruption in Embers of Mirrim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embers of Mirrim is a puzzle-platform where you take control over a mixed creature of light and dark. You can run, jump, glide, stomp, and split yourself into light and dark embers. Most of the game revolves around the latter, having you maneuver each ember with both analog sticks to navigate the world and solve puzzles. The creature can even interact with different aspects of the environment, the effects varying based on which ember you activate them with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a better feel of the gameplay, check out the video below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/htpl9d1Rv0I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually, Embers of Mirrim is pretty average fare. There’s plenty of nice looking backdrops and the level design is fairly interesting. The creatures of the world are rendered nicely, even if they’re a bit strange looking. The soundtrack isn’t very memorable. Even after hours of playing, I can’t bring to mind any tune I’ve heard while playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embers of Mirrim starts off &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; with a lengthy opening sequence and three different, &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; tutorial sections to get you used to the gameplay. The first real level is bland, requiring mostly just a bunch of running and a frustrating long section avoiding obstacles falling from a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get past this first 45 minutes or so of gameplay and you’ll finally be rewarded with interesting levels with clever puzzles and a bit more difficulty. At this point, it’s not just using your brains to solve puzzles, but also your reflexes. At times it can be frustrating, but very satisfying once you clear a section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the experience is positive, though not excellent. Embers of Mirrim brings a lot of great ideas to the table but falls a bit short on the execution. At a $20 price point, it’s not quite worth it. If it were $10 or $15 I’d suggest giving it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are much better games to spend your hard-earned dollars on. Wait for a good sale or price drop.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wicked Manticore Dice Towers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/WickedManticore&quot;&gt;Wicked Manticore&lt;/a&gt; creates a number of quality hand-finished wooden gaming accessories. Wicked Manticore was formed in 2015 by Michael and Matthew Caron of Maine. They selected the manticore to be their symbol because it represents a fearsome, powerful fantasy creature that hasn’t been played out to death (queue dragon, griffon, etc.). The “wicked” comes from the popular superlative of their homeland, Maine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wickedmanticore/wmdt1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wicked Manticore Dice Tower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Wicked Manticore shipped over a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/473865396/dwarven-bulwark-dice-tower-in-poplar?ref=shop_home_active_11&quot;&gt;Dwarven Bulwork dice tower in poplar wood with a Manticore inlay&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwarven Bulwork is a compact and sturdy dice tower designed by Wicked Manticore with the dwarven engineering philosophies of form and function in mind. The dice tower measures approximately 2 1/8” x 1 1/2” x 6”. Each dice tower is tooled and shaped from wooden ingots of unique poplar wood before being refined into its final shape by hand. Next, the dice tower is inlaid with the manticore logo (or some other unique design) before being hand-rubbed with natural oils to bring out the figure of the wood grain. Finally, a natural sealer is added as a protective coating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wickedmanticore/wmdt2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wicked Manticore Dice Tower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dice towers come in a variety of wood types to suit your preferences. You can see a video of these dice towers in action &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmxWV877qZw&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The towers are smaller in size than other dice towers so they don’t occupy too much room on your table. They also fit nicely into your backpack or pocket for travel. These dice towers pack a punch and look great too. The basic poplar dice tower sells for $15. Other varieties of wood and design will increase the price. While not the cheapest dice towers on the market, Wicked Manticore products definitely represent a level of care and craftsmanship rivaled by few. If you are looking for a nice dice tower for yourself or to gift to a friend, this is a great buy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yu-Gi-Oh! June Releases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yu-gi-oh/june2017.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!

        <title>Preview - Four Elements</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robertmurelli/four-elements-physical-gaming/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four Elements is currently finishing up a successful Kickstarter run with only a few days left remaining in the campaign. The game, a family-friendly dexterity affair is available for a £12 pledge. Pretty inexpensive for what you’re getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four Elements doesn’t come with a sheet of instructions, just a few pointers etched into its wooden box (Deluxe Version). The game’s goal is simple: knock the opponents’ Lord piece off the table or out of bounce. This is done by flicking your Elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up the game is only limited by your imagination. You place your Lord, Elements, and Barriers on the table in any manner you see if. You can arrange, stack, and stand your pieces any way you’d like. Once every player is set up the game progresses with everyone taking turns flicking pieces until there’s only one player left with a Lord on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four Elements comes in a laser-cut wooden box and contains 4 different sets of laser-cut acrylic pieces. While the prototype box I received keeps falling apart, designer Robert Murelli assures me those issues have been fixed for the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acrylic pieces are beautiful, with each element contain different shapes and even different thicknesses. This gives each element a slightly different feel in how it plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fourelements/pieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Four Elements&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a simple ruleset, great pieces, and a ton of different ways to setup the game and surfaces to play on, Four Elements is an excellent game for those who love dexterity games. For around $15 you can’t beat the value you get in the box. I should mention that the $15 version doesn’t come with the hand-crafted wooden box like I received. If you’re looking for that version it’s going to cost you around $102. To check out all the pledge levels head on over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robertmurelli/four-elements-physical-gaming&quot;&gt;Kickstarter page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype of Four Elements was provided free for preview by Robert Murelli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/rivals.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Epic Rivals Battle Set&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;I’ve run a lot of Beyblade tournaments over the years, but those were all for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldbeyblade.org&quot;&gt;World Beyblade Organization&lt;/a&gt;, who have a more rigid and standard set of rules for different types of tournaments. This is the first time in a long time that Hasbro has released resources for people to run their own tournaments at home, school, etc… Not only that, but official Hasbro tournmanets have been popping up in places, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to see Beyblade getting some love from Hasbro again. They recently sent me a bunch of Burst product to play with, along with some posters and printed tournament materials. My kids and I have been having a blast with the new Beys and they seem to have sparked my kids’ interested in the product again. While my local stores aren’t up to date with all the latest Beyblade Burst product releases, they’re easy enough to find online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in getting your own tournment going? Check out Hasbro’s [resources][https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/brands/beyblade/printables] here to get started! Need some Beys to get started? Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2qolJnq&quot;&gt;Beyblade Burst Epic Rivals Battle Set&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with 2 Beys, 2 launchers, and a stadium.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - The Deer God</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thedeergod/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Deer God&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blowfishstudios.com&quot;&gt;Blowfish Studios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://crescentmoongames.com/wordpress/&quot;&gt;Crescent Moon Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2015&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/328940/The_Deer_God/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-deer-god-ps4/&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/the-deer-god/c4dqxwtp8ss4&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $14.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turned into a deer by a deity of nature, a hunter must redeem himself by immersing himself in the hostile world he was once part of. The Deer God is a beautiful “endless runner” platformer with a procedurally-generated world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run! That’s pretty much the focus of The Deer God. As a deer you’ll run through the world jumping over obstacles, headbutting various hostile, or not so hostile, life, and gaining strange abilities that make your travel through the world easier. Mind your Karma, though. Killing innocents will lean you toward the evil side. Minding your business and helping the world’s inhabitants will make you a protector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the game, it may feel like there’s no point in playing. You run, trying not to die, or starve to death. You can interact with other deer to produce offspring, a way of “saving” your game should you die. As time passes your deer will age. Die, and you’ll start off as a young deer again in the place you last had offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you progress through the game you’ll find strange abilities for your deer. Double jumps, lighting antlers, etc… You’ll also find people and animals in need of assistance. They’ll send you on quests to find items and the like. Eventually, you’ll fight large bosses and find Deer Shrines and help enough people to “win” the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deer God is absolutely stunning with its pixel art and soothing soundtrack. It’s one of the things that first drew me to the game. The world is beautiful and it’s easy to just run along and watch as the land changes. Day slowly turns to night. Forests give way to deserts. There are houses and caves to explore. It’s all very soothing and tied together with an ambient soundtrack to make everything feel very serene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thedeergod/screens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Deer God Screens&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Breathtaking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deer God is beautiful, yes, but the buck stops there. It’s a very hollow game, filled with bugs and frustration, mostly due to the procedurally generated word. You may be sent on a quest to find an item only to find it’s right in front of your face, or nowhere to be seen at all. At times it feels as the world is too big, having you run forever before you find anything of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food becomes a problem when your deer is starving and the land provides no food. Combat is clunky and dangerous, even when you find some amazing powers to use. It’s very easy to be killed by the smallest creature or a random giant boss that you can’t escape from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the Karma system. Kill cute and fuzzy creatures or unarmed humans to drop your Karma. Help people, take out nasties, etc… to raise your Karma. Either way, it doesn’t really effect the gameplay too much. If it does, it’s not presented in any meaningful way, even after a few hours of play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to like The Deer God. It just felt a bit clunky and empty to really enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A PS4 copy of The Deer God was provided free for review by Crescent Moon Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first new Ys game in 8 years is finally on it’s way to the US and Europe. Releasing on September 12, Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA will be available for the PS4 and Vita with both physical and digital versions. The game will also get a digital PC release on Steam (Windows only.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ys VIII will feature dual audio (English and Japanese) as well as in-game text in English and French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a &lt;em&gt;REALLY&lt;/em&gt; long time since I’ve played a Ys game. Like, SNES era. I’m going to have to recify that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Magikarp Jump Now Available on Mobile</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemon/magikarpjump.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Magikarp Jump&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Have you ever dreamed of being the very best, like no one ever was? Now you can realize that dream…with your Magikarp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company International has just released Magikarp Jump, available for both &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplepointpr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1g8qlJhrLs7CU57_nXcwb1gL8iOz7utZXvtMJjk-Ewxo-1673822479&amp;amp;key=YAMMID-17428510&amp;amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fpok%25C3%25A9mon-magikarp-jump%2Fid1162679453%3Fl%3Den%26mt%3D8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplepointpr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1g8qlJhrLs7CU57_nXcwb1gL8iOz7utZXvtMJjk-Ewxo-1673822479&amp;amp;key=YAMMID-17428510&amp;amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Djp.pokemon.koiking&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Magikarp are weak and unimpressive. Yes, they’re pretty much useless until they evolve into a mighty Gyrados. That all changes in this new mobile game! In Magikarp Jump players will train their fishy Pokémon friend to maximize their jumping power. Jump the highest to prove your Magikarp is better than all the rest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if your Magikarp gets knocked out? What if, &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;, they become TOO awesome? Retire it and start with a fresh flop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magikarp Jump is free to download and play, but also features in-app purchases to help you speed up your training, replenish food, and catch more Magikarp. There’s also cosmetic items for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you waiting for? Get out there and make a splash!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - A Day at the Beach</title>

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144736/day-beach&quot;&gt;A Day at the Beach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Day at the Beach arrived on my doorstep recently from Standard Games. Distributed by The Game Crafter, it’s a simple set-collection game with a beach theme that described as part Rummy, part Miles Borne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Day at the Beach has only a few rules. Draw one card, play one card. Be the first to collect two sets of cards and you win! In the game there’s two types of cards, blue cards and yellow cards. Blue cards are the ones you’re trying to make sets with. Each card will let you know how many cards make up a set, and which cards those are. Swimmers are sets of 4, while Flip &amp;amp; Flop make up a set. There’s even a Treasure card that’s a set on it’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow cards are action cards that allow you to help yourself or slow down other players. A Pirate let’s you steal a card from another player and play it. Others let you manipulate the Ocean. The Ocean is a set of 8 face-up cards that can only be accessed by using yellow cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Play one card at a time until you’ve got two sets and you win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Day at the Beach is comprised of 90 cards, 84 of which make up the game (the rest are the rules.) Those familiar with Game Crafter cards should know what to expect quality-wise. They’re not quite Poker/CCG quality, but they’re far from cheap. My major complaint is that the cards either aren’t cut properly, or the image wasn’t setup properly on The Game Crafter’s end. The card backs aren’t centered properly, leaving them look like they’re a bit cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the artwork for the game, it’s very simple, fitting the theme of the game and not much else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When A Day at the Beach first arrived I wasn’t sure what to make of it. It looked to simple and bland to really capture my interest. I’m glad to say that actually playing to game proved to be quite entertaining. The use of variable sets, action cards, and the Ocean created a dynamic that proved to a lot fun than I was initial assumptions. While it’s not anything groundbreaking, A Day at the Beach provides a simple-to-learn, portable, fun game that should do well with fans of mass-market card games.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hobbit Leather Deckboxes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I received a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/491858650/leather-deck-box-for-card-solid-leather?ref=shop_home_active_5&quot;&gt;leather deck box&lt;/a&gt; from Hobbit Leather Works for review. Based out of Częstochowa, Poland, Igor Kazibudzki of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/HobbitLeatherworks?ref=l2-shopheader-name&quot;&gt;Hobbit Leather Works&lt;/a&gt; crafts a number of high-quality, beautiful leather products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hobbitleather/hobbitbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hobbit Leather Works Deck Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This two-toned leather deck box ($51.40) is handmade and made-to-order. Packaged in a professional cloth bag, this deck box contains a stylistic brass-colored locking mechanism to safely secure the box from unwanted or accidental openings. This deck box is also available with a more typical snap-closing device for $47.34. Externally, the box measures: 9 cm x 11 cm x 6 cm. Internally, the box measures: 7 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm, so it easily fits a number of Magic the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, or other cards from most table-top games. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Manic-Leather-Deck-Box-Review/&quot;&gt;other deck boxes that contain a thick waxed-thread stitch&lt;/a&gt;, this deck contains a small, tight stitch. Additionally, these deck boxes can be customized with unique tooling designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What impresses me most about Hobbit Leather Works is their friendly and professional communication. If you have a custom design idea for an order, just go ahead and contact them. You can also reach them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/HobbitLeatherworks/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Because Hobbit Leather Works ships from Poland, if ordering from the U.S., expect a two-week turnaround time. I highly recommend this deck box, and I am excited to check out other great leather products available from Hobbit Leather Works.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing - Tak Tavern Set &amp; Cloth Board</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cheapass Games recently sent me two full Tak travel sets to take on Scouting trips since I’ve gotten the boys hooked on the game. A travel set is comprised of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thetinkerspacks.com/collections/tak-a-beautiful-game/products/tak-tavern-set&quot;&gt;Tavern Set&lt;/a&gt; combined with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thetinkerspacks.com/collections/tak-a-beautiful-game/products/tak-cloth-board&quot;&gt;Cloth Board&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a surprisingly small package, and an excellent value at a total of $34. You can actually go even $3 cheaper by buying using nothing but a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thetinkerspacks.com/collections/tak-a-beautiful-game/products/tak-collector-coin&quot;&gt;Collector Coin&lt;/a&gt; to mark the center of the playspace instead of using a Cloth Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here’s some shots of what the set looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon Center Debuts Pokémon Woodblock Prints</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company International has debuts limited-edition woodblock prints created in traditional ukiyo-e style on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/&quot;&gt;PokémonCenter.com&lt;/a&gt;. The two prints, each priced at $450, are made on handmade paper and are limited to fifty prints for each piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port of Vermilion City Traditional Ukiyo-e Woodblock Print&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemon/WoodblockVermilionCity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Port of Vermilion City&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vermillion City from Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue is presented as a classic Japanese ukiyo-e landscape with a variety of Pokémon living and playing in it. Fans will find more than two dozen Pokémon pictured including Slowpoke, Pikachu, Meowth, Charizard, Lapras, and Gyarados. The Pokémon are all enjoying the waterfront port, as travelers in a landscape from Hiroshige Utagawa’s 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence Bridge Traditional Ukiyo-e Woodblock Print&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemon/WoodblockSNORLAX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Silence Bridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silence Bridge is a scene that depicts the exciting start of a battle, starring Pikachu, Red holding a Poké flute and an awoken Snorlax. Its composition and background are closely based on Yoshitoshi Tsukioka’s masterpiece Gojo Bridge, an Episode from the Life of Yoshitsune, an homage to the famous battle between two 12th century samurai, Ushikawa and Benkei.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Wyrmwood Gaming Leather Playmat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wyrmwoodgaming.com/&quot;&gt;Wyrmwood Gaming&lt;/a&gt; has made a name for themselves as one of the best creators of high-quality gaming accessories out there. Their excellent craftsmanship, selection of different woods, and selection of products set them apart from their competitors. It’s no surprise that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wyrmwoodgaming.com/products/wyrmwood-playmat/&quot;&gt;leather playmat&lt;/a&gt; they sent me to review was anything other than extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wyrmwood/button.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wyrmwood Mat Rolled&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;The level of detail, down the but button on the strap, is amazing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mat is stone-oiled Water Buffalo leather and comes standard with Wyrmwood’s logo and name engraved on it. Want to change the text? No problem. An extra $50 and you can have whatever you want on it. The quality of the leather is clear as soon as you open the box. The first thing to hit you is that wonderful leather smells. Upon taking the mat out and unrolling it you can appreciate just how beautiful the playmat really is. It’s thick, durable, and exactly what you’d expect from a high-quality leather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the mat comes rolled up, it’s still a bit stiff when it arrives. It takes a bit of breaking in to soften it up and have it lay flat on the table. You can do this by rolling it up on opposite sides, or use the included leather conditioner to treat it and speed the process up a bit. I used the rolling method with mine for a few days and it really makes a fantastic difference. It’s now softer and lays perfectly flat every time it’s unrolled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wyrmwood/mat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wyrmwood Gaming Playmat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a playmat that’s meant to last a lifetime, though it may require a bit of love and care for it to do so. Over time, like any leather product, the playmat will begin to show some wear. Now some people, myself included treasure this look. If you’re not one of those people you can use leather conditioner to remove surface imperfections and keep the mat looking like it just came out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as gaming mats go, you can’t get much better than this. It’s a piece that will last the test of time with a style that will never go, well, out of style. At $50 it’s a bit more than your average neoprene playmat, but it will certainly last much longer and is a much better investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total win.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>McFarlane to tackle The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mcfarlane/Jareth-slugged-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jareth&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;McFarlane Toys and The Jim Henson Company have teamed up to create a line of figures from Henson’s Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal. The first figure to be released will be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcfarlane.com/toys/jareth/&quot;&gt;7-inch figure of Labyrinth’s Jareth The Goblin King&lt;/a&gt;, followed by Jen and Kira from The Dark Crystal. Each figure will have McFarlane’s trademark detail and will be fully articulated. They’ll come in a windowed display case and will have movie-branded bases for those who want to take them out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jim Henson was one of the most visually creative minds, and these incredible movies are just the tip of the iceberg,” said Todd McFarlane, Owner and CEO of McFarlane Toys. “We pride ourselves on our creativity and attention to detail, and to be able to make figures of these iconic characters is something pretty special.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jareth will be out this November for $19.99 and can preordered &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcfarlane.com/toys/jareth/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
 Jen and Kira should be available in the Spring of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dan the Lefty Accessories Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel French of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/DanTheLefty&quot;&gt;Dan the Lefty&lt;/a&gt; sent over several examples of leather dice accessories for review. Based out of Atlanta, Georgia, Dan the Lefty specializes in made-to-order leather items, handmade with a careful attention to detail and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/danthelefty/dandeck.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dan the Lefty Deck Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first items shown here are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/188977315/leather-deck-box?ref=shop_home_active_5&quot;&gt;basic leather deck box&lt;/a&gt; ($20) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/194033471/leather-deck-box-with-belt-clip?ref=shop_home_active_30&quot;&gt;basic leather deck box with belt clip&lt;/a&gt; ($25). Measuring 3.75” x 2” x 3”, this leather deck box is designed to hold approximately 100 cards for Magic the Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh! These boxes are available in tan, light brown, dark brown, black, green, blue, or red leather. Additionally, Dan the Lefty accepts special custom orders and can create a unique-colored deck box or add custom tooling designs or engraving. These deck boxes contain a secure metal snap to prevent the top flat from opening and your cards spilling out. The quality of the leatherwork is excellent and the leather has a nice, glossy finished feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/danthelefty/dancup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dan the Lefty Dice Cup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two items shown are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/189519971/leather-dice-cup?ref=shop_home_active_9&quot;&gt;basic leather dice cup&lt;/a&gt; ($37) and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/214538261/leather-dice-cup-with-celtic-knot?ref=shop_home_active_8&quot;&gt;leather dice cup with Celtic knot designs&lt;/a&gt; ($45). Each dice cup measures 4” tall x 3” diameter. These made-to-order leather dice cups are perfect for any dice game, such as Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons or Imperial Assault. Additionally, each dice cup has a matching lid, so you can use it for storing your dice when you aren’t playing. They are available in the same color options and can also be engraved or customized with tooling. I was especially impressed with the Celtic knot designs. The intricate level of detail really adds a nice stylized touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The down side is that these leather products are not cheap. So, if you are looking for a low-cost way to store your cards or house your dice, these items are likely not for you. However, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for some quality leather gaming accessories to spruce up your play area and fill the room with that wonderful leather smell, than check these items out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Robots in Disguise Soundwave</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started getting back into collecting Transformers toys, primarily because of the Titans Return line offering designs I love, even for characters I’m not familiar with. The Robots in Disguise figures I’ve bought, on the other hand, have been because my son and I enjoy them from the show. Soundwave and Blur, my latest two buys, are exceptions, as we’ve not seen any episodes with them, yet. However, their designs really caught my eye, especially Soundwave’s. I’ll be reviewing Soundwave, comparing him against other RiD Warriors but also Titans Return Deluxe figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Character Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soundwave looks powerful. This alone made me put him in my cart. His robot mode has the broad shoulders, puffed-out chest and thick limbs of a gladiator. His vehicle mode has an aggressive front end that looks as much like an attack dog as combat vehicle. Whichever mode he’s in, he looks ready to take down some Autobots. This appearance is a 180 from his sleek and stealthy Prime iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rid/Standing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Soundwave Standing&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, this version of Soundwave has more in common with G1 Soundwave than the last decade of cartoons. He’s blue and grey in the same spots, has red bands around the wrists, a yellow outline around his chest plate, and if you look close you even see designs on his waist that match up with G1’s cassette playback control buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rid/SW_G1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Soundwave G1&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the Titans Return figures, Soundwave doesn’t seem like he’s hollow. In robot mode, flaps cover up most of the negative space on his forearms, and wheels in the calf design makes the figure appear solid. That is until you turn him around, and find that the back of his torso is mostly exposed, hollow forms. If you don’t usually play or photograph your figures from behind, this won’t be an issue for you. I’d have to say that if we’re going to be forced to have these empty holes on the Hasbro figures, then I prefer the trade of moving that from the limbs to the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rid/SW_alt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Soundwave Alt&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soundwave’s alt mode is consistent with earlier RiD Warrior vehicles such as Prime, Bumblebee and Strongarm. Which is to say, it has problems. Like the others, it doesn’t transform easily. The earlier Warriors are too reliant on small pegs and clips to provide friction, leading to breakages that render “complete” transformations impossible. In comparison, Soundwave has too few points of friction or clutch. This means that the fold-out flaps from his forearms, don’t line up evenly with the wheels, the wheels don’t necessarily sit perpendicular to the ground, and there are obvious gap issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rid/SW_alt_back.png&quot; alt=&quot;Soundwave Alt Back&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Playability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical issues of the alt mode are resolved by how fun it is, anyway. He rolls great, and his energy wheels up his cool factor. He’s built like a tank, making him fun to ram into other bots. The holes for his cannon have some tooth to them, which allows you to aim the cannon easily while preventing unwanted spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rid/SW_Portrait.png&quot; alt=&quot;Soundwave Portrait&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robot mode can be equally fun. With a little backlight, Soundwave looks like he’s coursing with energy due to the Jolly Rancher-pink translucent wheels and face. His wide feet easily support pretty much any stance you can put him in, including some where the back foot has only a toe touching the ground. His hips, shoulders, elbows, and neck are all ball joints that increase his range of dynamic poses. Notably lacking is any type of wrist articulation, since his hands aren’t part of the transforming process, leaving plenty of room in the design for at least a simple swivel.
The action starts to fall apart due to some frustrating problems with lack of clutch in his arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, his torso locks into place by lowering the shoulder joint. Internally, small clips grab the rails on the roof of the vehicle mode (or, cropped dog ears, as I see them). So, as long as you keep the shoulder joints down, there’s no problem. Yet, there’s so little friction there that most arm-raising actions pop the clip out of place. Once this happens to both arms, the whole chest starts moving like you’re starting to transform him. If you’re using his cannon in the traditional shoulder-mounted position, you won’t notice the problem because the gun keeps the upper torso in place. But if you use the cannon as a hand gun, or simply remove it, the problem shows up fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rid/SW_arm_issue.png&quot; alt=&quot;Soundwave Arm Issue&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue in his arms is that the friction pegs that lock his upper arms into place don’t have any corresponding holes, or anything, to clutch. If you try to bend his arms at his elbows, that upper arm is going to come out of place. So, you need to hold him by the upper and lower arm to pose, meaning I can’t naturally aim his hand during the course of play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I’d probably have returned this character for the engineering quality issues if I weren’t so enamored with his design. My son and I agree that he looks awesome and fun. However, this won’t be a figure he can enjoy as much on his own because the difficulty of placing the arms properly in alt mode, and the arm looseness problems in robot mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your main concern is getting a Soundwave that looks cool and poses well for photos or display, then this is a great figure, and the issues I’ve found are mostly irrelevant. But if you or younger Transformer fans in your household need more playability, I’d opt for Blur in this wave.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spells of Genesis Q&amp;A with Shaban Shaame, EverdreamSoft CEO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spellsofgenesis.com&quot;&gt;Spells of Genesis&lt;/a&gt; is a fairly new mobile game with a interesting blockchain-based card economy. What exactly does that mean? I asked Shaban Shaame, CEO of EverdreamSoft exactly that, along with a few questions about the game’s length and a player’s ability to play without spending real-world cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the decision to build a game around the blockchain based economy made early in the design process for Spells of Genesis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. Spells of Genesis game design came before the idea of including the game assets on the blockchain. Our previous game, Moonga, ,a top grossing app when it launched in 2010 was a strategic trading card game. We wanted to build upon this experience and have a game where the strategy of card game is preserved while having at the same time an easy and approachable gameplay. The concept of mixing arcade and card game came as an evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What benefit does a blockchain in-game economy give to the players?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We noticed with our previous game (Moonga) that players loved to trade the cards among each other for real money even if it was not allowed within the boundaries of the game’s terms and conditions. If something went wrong in their deal they would contact our customer support center and try to revert their trade which we could not help them with.. By using the blockchain, we removed ourselves from that process and gave a fantastic opportunity for players to truly own  their digital cards portfolio and its value . Just like physical cards people are free to give, lend, sell their cards in a decentralized way. Meaning that only the owner controls the cards and no one else can take them back from the hand of the users. This freedom is really setting Spells of Genesis apart from other games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are all card tradable? I’ve setup my account with Book of Orbs and noticed none of my current collection of cards was imported when I linked my accounts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two kind of cards, blockchain and off chain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offchain cards are just like in other games stored in our database and you can’t trade them. You also get a lot of them by playing. Offchain cards are not on book of orbs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blockchain cards are like physical one they are not centralized they are not stored in our database but on book of orbs or any compatible wallet. Taking this parallel you don’t OWN physical Pokémon cards in your home if you download the digital app. In order for you to receive real cards that you control, OWN: you have you have to get someone to give you one or purchase one in a store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How playable is the game without spending any real-world money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spending money in-game is a kind of an “accelerator”. The following example can illustrate the user experience when buying in-game (non blockchain) cards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two options:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Players can either buy one random card or a pack of ten random cards spending gold coins (soft currency) they have earned previously while completing a level. Probably, players purchase a common, or maybe a rare card (the cards are common, rare, epic and legendary). In this case, they didn’t need to spend any real-world money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Players can also buy one rare or better (epic or legendary) card, or one random epic or better (legendary) card with gems (hard currency) . In this case, the purchase requires the use of Gems which represents the “hard currency” which the players can acquire by spending real-world money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About how many hours worth of content is currently in game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have an energy system, limiting the play time. Instead of measuring the gameplay in hours, it is more relevent to use as a metric the number of days that players can invest in the game. Currently, active players can complete the 20 campaigns in about 2-3 weeks. After this point the players unlock the challenge mode, where they try to beat a record (reach as far as you can until all your cards have died).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the plan for future updates? How long is the app planned on being supported?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The next two updates will both add 5 new campaigns, providing a total of about 4-6 weeks of content for active players(the campaigns are bigger and more difficult). There will also be an asynchronous multiplayer mode, where players play random levels based on the cards of other similarly ranked players. When they win, they increase their rank and will earn gold and rare, epic and even legendary cards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will provide a lot of new features in updates every 2-3 weeks. Every 3 months there will also be an expansion with new cards, a new map with new campaigns and new spells and objects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is still a lot of design space in the game for new features, objects, spells and more. As the first signs of the player base are promising, we are confident to support and improve the game for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tributegames.com&quot;&gt;Tribute Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/401710/Flinthook/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/flinthook/cid=UP2114-CUSA07390_00-FLINTHOOKPS4SONY&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/p/flinthook/bp6bzkr83d6s?SilentAuth=1&amp;amp;wa=wsignin1.0&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $14.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read my “[5 Tips When Starting Flinthook(http://pawnsperspective.com/5-Tips-When-Starting-Flinthook/)]” article, you already have a bit of an idea about Tribute Game’s latest offering. Flinthook is an action-platform with roguelike elements where you speed through procedurally generated ships using a grappling hook, plasma gun, and Chronobelt that slows down time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loot the ships, track down your bounty, and show the universe why you’re the most feared bounty hunter around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Flinthook may be a small pirate, but he’s mighty! Equipped with a Blasma Pistol, Chronobelt, and, of course, his trusty Quickhook, Flinthook plunders pirate ships and hunts down bounties throughout space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core mechanic Flinthook employs is the Quickhook. It’s an extremely flexible and fast grappling hook that is one of your main means of transportation through each level. After a bit of practice, is becomes second nature to zip around each ship without much thought. Flinthook also has a Blasma Pistol to take out enemies and a Chronobelt to slow down time in small intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tep1b7jkfyw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game starts you off in a quick tutorial level, then gives you your first bounty. Each bounty requires 3 special coins, fed to your compass, to track down. You get these coins by plundering procedurally generated ships. Die, and you start the whole segment of the game over again. Of course, like any other roguelike, you get more powerful each time. In Flinthook it’s thanks to equipable Perks and a Black Market for buying core upgrades to Captain Flinthook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perks range from a more powerful Blasma Pistol to a faster Quickhook. The Black Market sells items to earn Flinthook more experience, up his Perk capacity, and more. Through careful Perk management and wise Black Market upgrades, the game becomes a bit easier each time you bite the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game still a bit tough? You can always pick how tough the ships you plunder are from a list of several choices. Each ship has icons that will show you what to expect inside. Sometimes it’s more loot. Sometimes it’s waves of enemies, extra traps, and other nasty surprises. After a bit of play, it becomes more clear which icons represent what bonuses/perils each ship contains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve cleared out 3 ships you can move on to take out your bounty, represented by a difficult boss. Flinthook progresses in this manner until you finally beat the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flinthook wouldn’t be Flinthook without it’s cartoony pixel-graphics. The visuals are both amazing and consistent, pulling you fully into the experience of the game’s world. Each character is wonderfully animated, expressive, and strange. Captain Flinthook, himself, is instantly likeable from the first few moments of taking control of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is also out of this world (pun, sadly, intended), keeping up with the pace of the game without being obnoxious. You’ll find yourself humming along as you race through levels, choose ships to attack, and purchase mighty goods from the Black Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much to dislike about Flinthook. The gameplay is tight, enjoyable, and fast-paced. Progression, while a bit tough starting out, gradually becomes easier as the game goes on. Something that lovers of roguelike games are very familiar with. The game’s hook (will it ever end?), the grappling mechanic, never feels to get old or get frustrating. It’s quite the opposite. Every time you land an amazing hook or use the Quickhook to narrowly bypass a nasty room leads to a feeling of immense satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tribute Games has a proven track record with games, but Flinthook goes above and beyond with a level of excellence that’s hard to beat. At $14.99 it’s one of the best deals around right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A PS4 copy of Flinthook was provided free for review by Tribute Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Privateer Press' May Releases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Privateer Press’ May releases are rolling in and they sent a few over for us to check out. Privateer Press rarely disappoints, and May is no exception. The quality of these minis is outstanding. As usual, looks like Privateer Press will be releasing some unique additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/may1.png&quot; alt=&quot;May Releases&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith alone is insufficient to protect the faithful. Thus, the Devout was built to guard the Protectorate’s leaders from heretics and engraved with holy inscriptions to protect its controller from accursed magic. The Dervish, on the other hand, is a divinely inspired weapon that uses its chassis’ unparalleled reflexes wholly for offense. The Purifier, crafted as a literal interpretation of wrathful scripture, has a singular drive to eradicate unbelief through the cleansing fires of the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dervish brings exceptional mobility thanks to its two initial melee attacks and Side Step. The Devout provides excellent defensive tech with its Defensive Strike, Spell Barrier and Shield Guard abilities. The all-new Purifier delivers the fires of Menoth straight to its foes thanks to Flame Trail and its twin flaming Immolator flails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIP 32110 Devout/Dervish/Purifier – Protectorate of Menoth Light Warjack Kit&lt;/strong&gt; (plastic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Base Size: 40mm\ 
PIP Code: 32110&lt;br /&gt;
Price: $24.99&lt;br /&gt;
Model Materials: Plastic\ 
Model Count: 1\ 
Packaging: Box\ 
Release Date: May 24, 2017\ 
Release Date Status: Actual&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/may2.png&quot; alt=&quot;May Releases&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chiron is one of the greatest basilisks ever broken to the skorne lash, and his subjugation attests to Beast Master Xekaar’s perfection of the art of physical conditioning through pain. The beast’s physical might is matched only by the power of his destructive gaze. Entire ranks of foes wither to dust as Chiron sweeps his cold eyes across them, and enemy warbeasts tear apart their own flesh in agony at his barest glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Beast Master Xekaar’s personal warbeast, Chiron makes a perfect purchase for players who have also picked up the Skorne Battlegroup Box (PIP 74095) as he gains boosted attack rolls on his SP 10, POW 15 Annihilating Gaze ranged attack. In addition his Leadership [Basilisks] ability means that this hulking basilisk works great in tandem with other Basilisk Drakes (PIP 74005).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Dog Might Games Skirmish Box</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dogmight/the-skirmish-box-a-custom-case-for-your-miniatures/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dog Might Games currently has a Kickstarter campaing running for a new product they’re calling the Skirmish Box. It’s a box for transporting all your most important minis to whatever battlefield they’re next to spill blood upon. Made from various hardwoods, these boxes offer a variety of comparments for your 25mm miniatures, dice, cards, and whatever else you might need. The bottom of the main compartment contains a metal plate, 26 guage cord rolled steel, covered by either felt or leather. Attach some magnets to the bottoms of your minis and they’re not going anywhere when stored inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dog Might Games sent me a Skirmish Box so I could check it out, and I can say it’s up to their high standards of quality. Mine has a phoenix on the lid, a 10”x3.5” compartment for minis and, a 10”x0.75” compartment for dice, writing utensils, etc… There’s plenty of other configurations that can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dogmight/the-skirmish-box-a-custom-case-for-your-miniatures&quot;&gt;campaign page&lt;/a&gt; to meet the needs of most miniatures fans. I’m currenlty using the box to carry around my Butcher Guildball team and the entire first season of minis fits inside without a problem. I can even store my team’s custom dice and templates inside with room to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dogmight/skirmish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Skirmish Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most Dog Might products, there’s a variety of woods, finishes, and lid designs available to customize your box even further. There’s plenty of add-ons too. Everything from straps to magnets. Prices for the box range from $99 to $249 depending on how you want your box. That’s not including any add-ons and upgrades you may decide on after pledging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skirmish Box has already blown through it’s goal, so pledge now and make sure you’re one of the first to get these awesome boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Salt &amp; Sanctuary</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/saltandsanctuary/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Salt &amp;amp; Sanctuary&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ska-studios.com&quot;&gt;Ska Studios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ska-studios.com&quot;&gt;Ska Studios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/283640/Salt_and_Sanctuary/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/salt-and-sanctuary/cid=UP0613-CUSA02353_00-SALTNSANCTUARY00&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/salt-and-sanctuary/cid=UP0613-PCSE01023_00-SALTSANCTUARY000&quot;&gt;Vita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $17.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt &amp;amp; Sanctuary is one of Ska Studios largest projects to date and tackles the enormous task of Dark Souls-like game in 2D. As a shipwrecked sailor in an unfamiliar land, the player must rescue the princess that holds to peace of the world in her hands. Of course, there are horrific creatures inhabiting the villages, valleys, and dungeons that lie between the shores the sailor washes up on and the princess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt &amp;amp; Sanctuary is a cross between a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania&quot;&gt;Metroidvania&lt;/a&gt; title and a Soulsborne (Dark Souls/Bloodborne) game. Players start the game by customizing a character by choosing a class, starting items, and how their character will look.  They’re then thrown into the game with a few hints on how to move, attack, save, and spend their Salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt, in this case, is the equivalent of Souls in Dark Souls. Every enemy will drop a bit, and it’s used to level up at Sanctuaries. There’s also weapons/armor to craft, a skill tree to progress through, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration in the world is dangerous. Monsters are everywhere, as are huge bosses, spikes to impale yourself on, and deadly heights to fall from. Players must hack, slash, block, roll, and use whatever else they can find to make their way from Sanctuary to Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_054dUJzCE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ska Studios has a very distinct look for their games, and Salt &amp;amp; Sanctuary is no different. The game is very dark, gritty, depressing, and oozing with theme. There may be some who are turned off by the visuals, but everything just &lt;em&gt;fits&lt;/em&gt; in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for how the game sounds, the soundtrack swells and declines with what’s happening in the game, increasing the tension or lulling you into a false sense of security. It’s just another layer that adds to the overall atmosphere of the game. One that does so seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt &amp;amp; Sanctuary is an ambitious project by a smaller studio and has some big shoes to fill. That being said, it does so beautifully, capturing the feeling Soulsborne games even while sticking strictly to 2D. It still &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like the games it takes its inspiration from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the game to Dark Souls doesn’t fully do it justice, though. As stated earlier, there’s as much Castlevania in the game as Dark Souls. Saying the game is just a mix of both titles still falls a bit more. Salt &amp;amp; Sanctuary may imitate these titles, but bring a ton of its own addictive gameplay and charm to the mix. It’s a solid title, and not one to pass up if you’re of fan of Metroidvania and/or Soulsborne titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be prepared to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A PS4 copy of Salt &amp;amp; Sanctuary was provided free for review by Ska Studios.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

        <title>Cassie’s Curiosities Dice Trays</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/cassiescuriosities&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/CassiesCuriosities?ref=condensed_trust_header_title_items&quot;&gt;Cassie’s Curiosities&lt;/a&gt; sent over two dice trays for review. Cassie is based out of Watertown, New York and specializes in a number of handmade gaming and cosplay items. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/260452204/square-wooden-dice-or-jewelry-tray-with?ref=shop_home_active_34&quot;&gt;square wooden dice trays&lt;/a&gt; ($20) are customizable with a number of paint, stain, and foam options. For an additional $5 you can also add a matching set of dice! Measuring 7” x 5” x 0.75”, these dice trays offer plenty of room for your dice to tumble and roll without the risk of colliding with game board components. Additionally, the foam-lined floor prevents your dice from bouncing out of the tray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cassie/cassie1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cassie Dice Trays&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown here are two trays: stained-wood with purple foam and swirl-green dice and white with blue foam and translucent-purple dice. Each tray is handmade: cut, sanded, stained or painted, and finished. The wood trays are lightweight and smooth to the touch. And with some really wild foam options like sparkle pink, orange leopard, or blue zebra patterns, the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always impressed with professional presentation of product, and this is no exception. The trays arrived packaged professionally, with a wonderful handwritten note, making these trays a perfect gift option for any gamer. Additionally, Cassie was generous enough to include a &lt;em&gt;15% off coupon code for our readers&lt;/em&gt;! Just enter “&lt;strong&gt;PAWN15&lt;/strong&gt;” during checkout. How cool! These dice trays are truly one-of-a-kind, check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Minimum Pledge:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/24259463/aegis-super-combining-robot-tactics&quot;&gt;$49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 15-30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 10+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://zephyrworkshop.com/rulebook/AEGIS_Rulebook-5-1-2017-1.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146144/egis-combining-robot-strategy-game&quot;&gt;A.E.G.I.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do combat robots excite you? How about robots that &lt;em&gt;combine&lt;/em&gt;? How about robots that combine in &lt;em&gt;multiple ways&lt;/em&gt;? A.E.G.I.S. has you covered on all fronts. Command a squad of five robots of varying classes, Assault, Evasive, Guard, Intel, and Support, to crush your foes. Combine 2 or more robots to create powerful robots with the best of their combined classes for even more battlefield advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zephyr Workshop has just launched A.E.G.I.S.: Combining Robot Strategy Game on Kickstarter for a price that won’t cost an arm and a leg, but will let you combine robots to form them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics of A.E.G.I.S are simple. Build a team of 5 robots and a reserve deck of up to 5 combiners. There’s a multitude of different robots to choose from in the 5 different classes listed above. Each robot in your team provides a certain amount of Energy. Added up the Energy creates a pool of points players can use during their turn. From there, players duke it out using Energy to move, attack, and combine their robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each robot has it’s own attacks and abilities that relate to its class. Combined robots inherit attacks and abilities from the robots they’re made up of. Combined robots can be as simple as two robots, example: an AS-Class would be the combination of an Assualt-class robot and Support-class robot, or up to a full behemoth of a five robot AEGIS-Class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is won by destroying all opposing robots, disarming opponents so they can’t deal damage, or draining your opponent’s Energy so they can’t take any actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the full rules, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://zephyrworkshop.com/rulebook/AEGIS_Rulebook-5-1-2017-1.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the copy of A.E.G.I.S. I received was a prototype, much of the final artwork was provided. I can’t comment on the quality of the components, but the actual graphic design of the game is looking great. Every robot has its own look and feel, while the combined robots look as amazing as you’d expect them to. The game is bright and colorful, making each class of robot easy to distinguish from the others. That, combined with (pun intended) a detailed, yet approachable, overall art style makes A.E.G.I.S. stand out with it’s own style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/aegis/aegisstuff.png&quot; alt=&quot;AEGIS Pieces&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first had the opportunity to play A.E.G.I.S. around three years ago when they first starting creating prototypes. I enjoyed the game then, and was sad to see it never got the release it deserved. Then Zephyr Workshop teamed up with Greenbrier Games, drastically overhauled the art and mechanics, and really put the pedal to the metal hyping the game and getting it ready for Kickstarter. Unfortunately, the original campaign didn’t fund due to several factors like a high price point, confusing entry (multiple starter sets), and lack of essential materials (no AEGIS-Class robots in starter sets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest campaign, now indie again, fixes all those issues with a single, clear product, tons of content, and a much friendly price point of around $50. Everything needed for 4 players to enjoy the game is included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;40 Robots (cards/standees)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12 Terrain Tiles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30 Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 Commander Panels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8 Dice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rulebook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double-sided Board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in the original campaign you’d get a handful of level 2 and 3 combiners, you know get a full compliment including level 4 and 5 combiners. There’s even a deluxe version that adds a neoprene mat, expansions, and a lore book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids and I really enjoy the game. With simple rules, depth provided by team building/robot abilities/combining, and a play time of under an hour, A.E.G.I.S. hits all the right buttons for us. I’m glad to see they’ve cleared up their campaign, made it easier to get into the game, and made the price more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is certainly a game to back.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Underleague</title>

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/223132/underleague&quot;&gt;Underleague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cogwright Games recently launched a Kickstarter campaign for Underleague, a fantasy-themed game where players battle horrific monsters in illegal underground fights. Players each take the role of a monster breeder facing their monsters against the rest in search of fortune in the pits. It’s not always stabling the best monsters, though. Sometimes it’s knowing when to bet against yourself to gain the upper hand needed to be victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal in Underleague is to achieve 20 Victory Points by fielding high-value creatures and winning battles against fellow players. Each player, at all times, will have 3 creatures in their stable to fight with, each having a daytime battle value, nighttime battle value, the creatures worth, and sometimes an ability. Each round players will complete a Pre-Season Phase to do some book keeping, swap out monsters if needed, and use Battle Chips earned from the previous round to purchase more strategy cards. After this, they’ll take turns using their chips to be for/against any monster on the table. Then card play/combat occurs, earning players victory cards and their chips back (if they’re lucky!) This is where Strategy cards come in handy, affecting the game in various ways or equipping creatures with a multitude of buffs/weaknesses. Play continues this way until a player has earned 20 Victory Points calculated during the Pre-Season Phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the full rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/580ba7f846c3c4e1c73d0c1d/t/5872a9c96b8f5b2a8eeda450/1483909586317/Underleague+Game+Rules+%28PnP%29.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t really comment on the the components of the game since what I received was a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; basic prototype. From what I’ve seen on the Kickstarter page, the artwork looks amazing. I’ll have to hold off judgment here until I received a finished product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/underleague/cards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Underleague Cards&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;The final artwork in the game is absolutely amazing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was a bit hard to get into the theme of the game without any artwork or flavor text, it really let me focus solely on the mechanics of Underleague. While the basic rules are fairly simple, all the depth comes from the creatures and strategy cards and their abilities/effects. The bidding mechanism, which I didn’t think I was going to be a huge fan of, turned out to be one of the most fun parts of the game. It really takes some thinking to figure out where to place your bets to maximize your card currency for the next round. Other players’ bets can seriously impact your turn, possibly causing you to try and intentionally tank one of your own creatures so you can keep an extra Battle Chip away from someone else. Add that it to trying to maximize attack and defense with daytime/nighttime battles and you’ve got an excellent card dueling game with tons of replayability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to seeing Underleague funded and getting my hands on a final version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Oceanhorn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/oceanhorn/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Oceanhorn&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornfox.com&quot;&gt;Cornfox &amp;amp; Bros.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornfox.com&quot;&gt;Cornfox &amp;amp; Bros.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2015&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/339200/Oceanhorn_Monster_of_Uncharted_Seas/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas-ps4/&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas/c1zsx0z50vw2&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oceanhorn/id708196645?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FDGEntertainment.Oceanhorn.gp&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $14.99 (PC,Consoles), $8.99 (Mobile)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first start playing Oceanhorn you may think you’re playing a popular game in Nintendo’s library. That’s because the game is pretty much a Zelda title with some names and identifying details having been changed to protect the privacy of individuals. In fact, the game probably could have been called Oceanhorn: The Wind Waker, if it wouldn’t get Cornfox &amp;amp; Bros. in a world of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, can it live up to the series it tries so hard to emulate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having read the above intro, you know what to expect gameplay-wise from Oceanhorn. There’s a sword to swing, bombs to throw, and pots to smash. There are dungeons that hold powerful new items to help you through the next dungeon, and so forth. There’s even sailing the open ocean from island to island as you search for your father and the mysterious monster, Oceanhorn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YJxpQ8KGRa8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oceanhorn is vibrant. It’s bursting with colorful and cute charm. Enemy models are interesting, varied, and wonderfully bizarre, while the steampunk elements of the world ooze theme. The environments, even the ocean which you’ll spend so much time on, are wonderful and full of life. My only problem with the game’s visuals are the people. Something about the stubby legs and ultra long torsos feels a bit off and sometimes doesn’t mesh well with the rest of the game. It’s a minor gripe, really, as it’s not a big enough deal to deter from the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans of Zelda will feel right at home with Oceanhorn. The game’s familiar formula makes it easy to jump into and enjoy, while some of the streamlined gameplay make tasks that started to feel like a slog in The Wind Waker, specifically sailing, a joy. Unfortunately, it’s just not enough. While the simple task of sailing has become easier, puzzles are uninspired and repetitive, generally involving moving boxes and finding keys. There’s rarely a case when a puzzle requires much thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story also suffers a bit. It plots along without any real twists or major developments. NPCs are all fairly flat with nothing important to say except the occasional point in the right direction. Overall Oceanhorn lacks a bit of emotion that the games it pays homage to all seem to have, even with a silent protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Oceanhorn fun? It is. It just doesn’t have much staying power and tries to fill some pretty big boots. Then again, at $14.99 on PCs and consoles, and $8.99 on mobile, it’s worth checking it out if you’re a fan of the genre or if you want a Zelda-style game on something other than a Nintendo console.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Mothership</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mothership/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mothership&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Peter Sanderson&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wingogames.com/&quot;&gt;WinGo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2015&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mothership-game.com/&quot;&gt;$69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 45-180 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 12+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1egHVWKU4Ws&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194964/mothership-tabletop-combat&quot;&gt;Mothership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I received a Limited Edition Silver Box copy of Mothership, the tabletop combat space strategy game.  Mothership is a simple game to learn, players take turns moving ships, attacking other players, capturing planets, and managing their economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mothership/mothership1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mothership&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mothership game box contains the game board (20” x 20”), 6 control panels, 6 tech trees, 42 miniature space ships and stands, 8 planets and stands, 92 action cards, 30 resource cards, 12 artifact cards, 6 victory point cards, 12 asteroid field tiles, a set of 5 dice, 42 capture markers, and a number of token counters. The quality of the game components is outstanding and all of the game materials have an intrinsic stylized look and feel. My biggest complaint is the overall size of the components. Small delicate miniatures crowd the game board creating a tedious hex grid that was constantly being jostled by elbows and rolling dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplay was great. The goal is to survive, while also wiping out your opponents. The game is fast-paced (always a plus in my opinion). All players begin with the same core set of ships and must collect and spend resources on various techs and action cards in order to attempt to gain an advantage over their opponents. One thing that I found truly unique and clever is the use of a master control panel to govern your mothership’s stats. This allows you to decrease power allocated to your weapons, shields, or speed in order to increase the power of another. This makes the mothership a versatile fighter capable of dishing out heavy-hitting attacks, pulling off calculated escapes, and withstanding substantial damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, each player’s tech tree allows strategic customization and fleet specialization. The tech tree also aids in curbing run-on games by allowing players to increase their power exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would absolutely recommend this game to any avid tabletop gamer. The game is easy to learn, fun to play, and is truly unlike anything out there. With unique game mechanics to set this game apart, it had my attention from start to finish. I would recommend using a dice tray to avoid the frustration of constantly knocking over the pieces. I look forward to my next chance to pick up the dice and play this game again. If you haven’t checked this game out, it is worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Lost Castle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lostcastle/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lost Castle&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; Hunter Studio&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://anotherindie.com/game/lost-castle/&quot;&gt;Another Indie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/434650/Lost_Castle/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/434650/Lost_Castle/&quot;&gt;$9.99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I first wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/PAX-East-2017-Lost-Castle/&quot;&gt;Lost Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Developed by Hunter Studio and published by Another Indie, Lost Castle is a cute brawler with roguelike elements. Of course being cute is just a ruse to lull you into the brutal fight for your life you’re in for when you play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYrgEfaUIIk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with games like Castle Crashers then you’ll be right at home with Lost Castle. It’s a fantasy beat’em up where 1-2 players battle waves of increasingly difficult enemies through randomly generated levels. Character classes are not chosen at the game’s start, but by the weapons picked up along the way. Each weapon has different strengths, abilities, and special attacks. There’s also different suits of armor, along with a multitude of one use weapons, items, and potions to help you along the way. Rescuing characters from the dungeon will allow you to start your next game with better equipment once you die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you progress through the various levels of the game you’ll collect souls from the enemies you defeat. One you die you lose your current hero and all their equipment, but can use your souls to buy different powerups for your next playthrough. Spend them wisely, because any unspent souls are lost. The more you play Lost Castle, the more you’ll die. The more you die, the stronger you eventually become. The stronger you become, the farther you’ll get. The cycle continues until you finally face the final boss of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the graphics aren’t anything particularly special, they fit the game very well. It’s a mix of the aforementioned Castle Crashers and the game’s own style. It’s cartoony, colorful, and incredibly light-hearted. It’s a bit offputting that the game moves slightly better than an old Flash game, but it’s something that can quickly be gotten used to and doesn’t hamper enjoyment of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the soundtrack, it’s not very memorable. It’s a shame because Another Indie makes it a point to let people know the soundtrack was provided by SonoTrigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Lost Castle may seem frustrating during the first playthrough or two, it quickly ramps up as souls are spent and better weapons/armor are unlocked. It doesn’t take long before later levels are reached and epic weapons can be found to cut down large swaths of enemies in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, there’s plenty of other games like it on the market that do a better job. Lost Castle is entertaining, and I certainly played it for a good while, but I quickly tired of it after a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166341/7-7&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had the opportunity to receive a copy of Seven &amp;amp; Seven. Seven &amp;amp; Seven is a fast-paced card game with quick rounds and an ever-changing play area. What makes this game exciting is that the games are short-lived with very little stagnant turn time. Before we get too deep into the game mechanics, let’s take a look at what is inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/7&amp;amp;7/seven1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seven &amp;amp; Seven&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The box contains a rulebook, a set of 77 cards, and two quick-reference guides. The rulebook is short and sweet—always refreshing. The game took no more than 15 minutes or so to comprehend, and there is an easily digestible online video to get you up and running quickly. Once you grasp the basics, most of the game is controlled by text contained on the cards themselves. This makes it easy for anyone to simply sit down and dive right in. The cards are well-designed, easy to read, and contain some light-hearted artwork to set the game mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/7&amp;amp;7/seven2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7 &amp;amp; 7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the game is to collect a set of all seven sins or all seven virtues before your opponents. Most cards contain one of each printed on the card and can be played as either a sin or a virtue. Additionally, there are other types of cards, like wild cards and “converter” cards to help you along the way. Each player starts with five cards. Each round, a player plays a card from their hand, performing whatever action (or actions) that may be allowed based on the printed text on the played card. After playing a card, the player draws a new card and the next player takes her turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played three or four five-player games and really enjoyed it. The games moved quickly and made an excellent appetizer for the board-intensive game that came next. We found it important to strategize and keep watch of the cards in play. Also, it was helpful to keep your hand and play area neat and tidy (recommended in the rule book)so other players can have a view of your cards. The quick-reference guides were also a big help with keeping all players apprised of the cards in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is easy to understand for those who have never played, moves quickly to reducing boredom, and is complex enough for the rule-conscious schemer. The verdict? This is a great game. And, at $17.99, there are few reasons not to add this to your game shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Doug Out Crafts Dice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Doug Wilson of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/DougOutCrafts&quot;&gt;Doug Out Crafts&lt;/a&gt;, specializes in creating unique handmade dice. Each die is engraved using a high-powered laser to produce a one-of-a-kind item perfect for the avid dice collector or any tabletop enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dougoutcrafts/dougoutdice1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Doug Out Crafts Dice&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dougoutcrafts/dougoutdice4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Doug Out Crafts Dice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown here are three examples of his artistic work on a 20-sided die. The designs pictured here are: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/384951290/graffiti-unique-laser-etched-d20?ref=related-1&quot;&gt;Graffiti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/462025122/ouija-planchette-unique-d20-for?ref=related-1&quot;&gt;Ouija Planchette&lt;/a&gt; (September 2016), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/482843219/unique-d20-fortune-teller-20-sided-die?ref=related-3&quot;&gt;Fortune Teller&lt;/a&gt; (October 2016). These dice cost $15 a pop. However, this acrylic-painted unique item is worth the price to most gamers. The dice are an example of excellent craftwork. They roll smoothly and evenly and the numbers are easily read. Additionally, they are attention-grabbing and would make a nice addition to any stylized game. If you are looking for something a bit more distinctive, be sure to check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - ALPHA Table</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s 6ft x 4ft, folds to 48in x 18in x 7 in, and is light enough for a single person to carry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ALPHA Table from &lt;a href=&quot;https://firmerterra.com/&quot;&gt;Firmer Terra&lt;/a&gt;, a lightweight, folding, entry-level gaming table made with miniatures gaming in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firmer Terra created the ALPHA out of need. They love miniatures and needed appropriate space to play when at home. Of course, tables to support miniatures campaigns need a lot of space and aren’t the easiest things to just tuck away. The price was also a factor. Thus, the ALPHA Table was born. A table that’s large enough to play, but can fold up and be stored easily by a single person. It’s also only &lt;a href=&quot;https://firmerterra.com/purchase-now/&quot;&gt;$189.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firmer Terra sent me and ALPHA Game Table AGT-01 to take a look at, and I’ve been very impressed with their efforts. The table came packed well and within a few minutes of unboxing it, I had it set up and ready to play my first game on it. The instructions were clear, but there’s also a video on how to set the table up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Sph09UGTMU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say I had my doubts upon first opening the table. It felt a bit flimsy at first while. I was attaching all the legs. Once the table was upright those fears vanished as the table, while lightweight, still held up like a champ to 3 of my kids and I gaming on it. My only complaint here is that I wish the segments had a locking mechanism to make it a bit easier when setting the table upright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/alpha/table.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ALPHA Table&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;I should mention the table has been a real life-saver for my family. We’re currently having major renovations done, which means all our large furniture had to be moved to the garage while walls were knocked down and floors ripped up. The ALPHA has served not only our gaming needs but our dining needs in this crazy time. We’re a family of 6, so the giant space has worked out quite well for meals. The portable nature of the table means I can set it up when I need it and store it away so the contractors can work when we’re done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in need of a gaming table on a budget, I can’t recommend the ALPHA enough. It’s not just a great portable gaming table, but a great overall table for the price. When I hit up the next local gaming convention I’ll be bringing my ALPHA to set up my equipment on, conduct interviews, and be my general base of operations. It’s folded up size makes it super easy to fit in my trunk, and it’s light enough that even if I need to carry it a block or two from a parking garage it won’t break my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firmer Terra had a great idea and has produced an awesome product.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Manic Leather Deck Boxes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Carl Cox of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/ManicLeather?ref=condensed_trust_header_title_items&quot;&gt;Manic Leather&lt;/a&gt; sent over a few deck boxes for review. These deck boxes are excellent. Each leather deck box is handmade with fine leather and hand sewn with sturdy waxed thread. They can be custom ordered in a variety of colors and are fitted with two thick belt loops that can fit up to a two-inch belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/manicleather/manicdeck1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Manic Leather Deck Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first deck box shown here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/248146490/handmade-leather-deck-box?ref=shop_home_active_6&quot;&gt;basic leather deck box&lt;/a&gt; in scarlet red. This style deck box fits approximately 60 cards with sleeve protectors and costs $30. It is fitted with a snap lid to keep your cards safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/manicleather/manicdeck2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Manic Leather Deck Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second deck box pictured here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/262298392/leather-deck-box-with-purse-turn-lock?ref=shop_home_active_19&quot;&gt;two-toned deck box with a purse turn locking mechanism&lt;/a&gt; in black and medium brown. This box also holds approximately 60 sleeved cards, is made from the same quality thick leather, and costs $45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/manicleather/manicdeck3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Manic Leather Deck Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each deck boxes can also be tooled for an additional fee. The fee depends on the intricacy of the design. The third box shown here is a forest-green 80-card deck box with a silver purse lock mechanism. This custom box also has a Magic the Gathering forest symbol tooled design. This design would add $5 to the price of the deck box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These deck boxes are great, and (like all fine leather), they smell great too. They can be used to house your collectible card decks or card sets from your favorite board games. They are handmade to order, so each deck box is a quality, unique product. They are a bit pricey, but with most gaming accessories, you get what you pay for. They look great on your shelf and are very functional. Great product, solid buy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Wicked Apples</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wickedapples/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wicked Apples&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Robert Fowler&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://almostagame.com/&quot;&gt;Almost a Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://almostagame.com/store/wicked-apples&quot;&gt;$15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 10-15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 12+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;amp;v=SPZG8RSnk_A&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209053/wicked-apples&quot;&gt;Wicked Apples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wicked Apples comes in a very tiny tuck box containing only 36 cards. 4 of those cards are the rules. 5 are player makers. That leaves you with 27 cards to play the game with. It’s certainly a micro game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a good one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;wicked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wicked Apples is extremely easy to pick up and play. Each player first takes a bucket at random and places it face down in front of them. Once every player has one they’re revealed and each player takes a Wicked Apple card that corresponds with their color bucket. The random distribution of buckets is important because the numbers on the buckets determine who goes first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wickedapples/wicked.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wicked Apples&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Once everyone has a Wicked Apple and bucket the rest of the cards are shuffled and everyone gets 3 from the deck. Players may look at their cards, then must place them, along with their Wicked Apple, face down in front of their bucket. They may not look at them again. Now the game can start. The player with the lowest numbered bucket starts the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two phases in Wicked Apples. The first has players taking turns either sliding one of their face-down apples in front of another player or peeking at one of another player’s face-down cards. Once everyone has done this each player will choose one of their cards to “eat”. To eat an apple a face down card is chosen and flipped over. It’s effect, if it has one, is immediately resolved. Once an apple is eaten it’s placed in the player’s bucket, changing the number that determines who goes first next round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you eat a Wicked Apple, you’re out of the game. The last person standing wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to see what &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; card in the game does, check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://almostagame.com/wicked-apples/appledex&quot;&gt;Appledex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Wicked Apples comes in a small package that doesn’t mean it lacks in production quality. The tuckbox is thick and rugged, while the cards don’t skip on the stock. The artwork on the cards is bright, colorful, with easy-to-read text and lots of flavor. Pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wicked Apples is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun, especially with a full compliment of players. The game gets chaotic very fast with everyone trying to memorize what’s on the table as cards are constantly changing ownership. Take into account the special properties of each different kind of apple and you’ll find your head spinning in no time. While the game only has a handful of cards, it by no means lacks in the fun department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one I’ve been keeping at work for a few rounds here and there at lunchtime. It’s easy to store, quick to teach, and hasn’t failed to entertain yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Minimum Pledge:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1650934249/glorytm&quot;&gt;$30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 45-75 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 13+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; No&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly Twisted Games launches their latest Kickstarter May 1, 2017. Glory is a competitive card game for 2-4 players. Although the age recommendation reads 13+, this is no doubt an adult-themed game. Throughout the course of the game, players—through various champions—collect resources, acquire spells, and combat creatures in order to turn the tide of the game in their favor. The Kickstarter box promises to contain a number of cards: 1 quick-reference guide, 6 playable champions, 5 cruel lords, 15 powerful elites, 25 confused minions, and 20 mystical spells. Additionally, the box contains a number of colored cardboard tokens, and the rules booklet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/glory/glory1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Glory&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/glory/glory2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Glory&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we were fortunate enough to receive a copy of Glory for review before the Kickstarter launch. After a few read-throughs of the 11-page rule booklet, we were ready to get started. My biggest complaint of the game was the learning curve. If you are looking for a quick pick-up-and-get-started game, then this is definitely not the game for you. Within a few pages of exploring the rule booklet, I was lost—the victory condition is not even explained until page 6. However, once you get the hang of it (like most games), it starts to come together. The object of the game is to amass 20 “Glory” or satisfy the victory condition detailed on your Devoted Lord card. However, this is no easy feat, as your opponents will constantly try to change the playing field by casting spells that often have a direct impact on your path to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/glory/glory3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Glory&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glory is rife with gamer satire and trashy humor. The game components have an artistic and comedic edge that helps to keep the game interesting. Glory is a simple and inexpensive game with a lot to offer. If unique novelty-style card games are your thing, go and check out their Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype copy of Glory was provided free by Slightly Twisted Games for this preview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - The Broken Token King of Tokyo Organizer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebrokentoken.com/&quot;&gt;The Broken Token&lt;/a&gt;’s game organizer inserts since the first time I saw them a PAX East a few years back. For those unfamiliar, The Broken Token makes laser cut wooden organizers for games that are meant to fit in the game’s original box. Of course over the years they’ve expanded to fully custom boxes, accessories, and a few other things, but their core line is still organizers. Unfortunately I never really had a need for one, not having the supported games or enough expansions for a particular game to make having an organizer worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, with my acquisition of both the Power Up! and Cthulhu Monster pack for King of Tokyo, I suddenly had a need. A quick email to The Broken Token and we worked out a deal for me to review their organizer for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kingoftokyo/brokenflat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Broken Token KoT flat pack&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;The organizer came flat packed in a plastic envelope with instructions on how to put the thing together. The instructions were clear, easy to follow, and the pieces went together without much confusion or fuss. When it came time to slip the completed organizer into the box I was surprised with how snugly it fit inside. Not only that, but it really did have enough space to hold the base game, both expansions, and even more future content. Everything is held in nicely, with a notch for the board to cover up especially loose bits. Once the box is closed everything stays where it needs to stay. It really doesn’t even add much extra weight to the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebrokentoken.com/king-of-tokyo-1/&quot;&gt;King of Tokyo Organizer&lt;/a&gt; will run you around $20. It’s a pretty sweet deal if you’ve got the game and all the added goodies to go with it. Not only will be you savings space by combining everything into one box, you’ll be protecting your pieces in a way you just can’t by tossing all that stuff into the box without an organizer. It also keeps your cards nice while you play and has a removable tray for the tokens and energy cubes. This keeps your table much tidier while you’re off rampaging Tokyo and battling other mighty beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kingoftokyo/brokencomplete.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Broken Token KoT complete&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Broken Token King of Tokyo Organizer was provided at a discount rate for review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Tower Rex Game Shields</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been playing some late-night sessions of Fantasy Flight’s A Game of Thrones Board Game with a group of friends. Given how competitive the game can be, the small, flimsy original paper player screens can be fairly frustrating. Not having enough room to organize your tokens, cards, and units makes secret strategizing and plotting your neighbor’s destruction all the more difficult. Thus, I was excited when I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/TowerRex?ref=profile_shopname&quot;&gt;Tower Rex&lt;/a&gt;’s custom laser-cut &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/TowerRex?ref=profile_shopname&quot;&gt;game shields&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/towerrex/screens1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Game Shields&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These game shields are really cool. The whole set only costs $22—for real, that’s all. Included in the set are six unique game shields, one representing each house of the game: Storm’s End, Casterly Rock, Winterfell, Highgarden, Sunspear, and Pyke. Each game shield has its house keep laser-cut on its face. On the back is a ledge for your units, space for your decks, and slots to neatly organize your tokens. The sides of the game shields wrap around to block your opponent’s lines of sight. There is even enough space to insert the original paper screens in order to still have access to the game information contained on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/towerrex/screens2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Game Shields&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game shields are shipped disassembled and attached to a sprue. Assembly was very easy and did not require any tools or glue. The game shields shipped from Kiev, Ukraine, so they took some time to arrive. However, it was well worth the wait. Every now and then an accessory comes along that is worth getting excited about. This is one of those items. And, the entire set only costs $22! I can’t stress how impressed I was with these game shields!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game shields provided free for review by Tower Rex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yu-Gi-Oh! May Releases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yu-gi-oh/may2017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! May Releases&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;May is almost here, and that means another round of relases for the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. Next month will see two new releases: &lt;strong&gt;Maximum Crisis&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Duelist Pack: Dimensional Guardians&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Crisis&lt;/strong&gt;, a 100-card set, arrives May 5th in 9-card booster packs. The entire set contains 48 Commons, 20 Rares, 14 Super Rares, 10 Ultra Rares, and 8 Secret Rares and will retail for $3.99 per pack. This new set introduces three new themes and the final evolutions of Pendulum Summoning with Pendulum scales of 0-13. This finally opens up the ability to summon &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; level monster from any deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 29th will see the release of the latest Duelist Pack, &lt;strong&gt;Dimensional Guardians&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a 45-card set sold in 5-card boosters for $1.99 per pack. The set breaks down to 22 commons, 10 Rares, 6 Super Rares and 7 Ultra Rares. Here we’ll see the return of Jack Atlas, Kite Tenjo, and Alexis Rhodes armed with cards from &lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&lt;/em&gt;, as well as new cards from &lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V&lt;/em&gt;. Performapals, Speedroids, Frightfurs and Raidraptors make up a bulk of the cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, no Dinomists.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Tips When Starting Flinthook</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/flinthook/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bazaar&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Tribute Games recently released Flinthook, an action platformer and roguelike pirate game that has you zipping around levels with an anchor-like grappling hook while hunting bounties. Tribute shot me off a PS4 key for the game and I’ve been having a hell of a good time with the game. After a few hours of playing, I’ve come up with 5 tips for those of you playing for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Die&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you go through the tutorial level you’ll be tossed straight into the game. Make your way through a ship and then die. This will use your available experience to go up in rank, get you a booster pack or two of Perk cards, and unlock the Black Market (among a few other things.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Black Market is where you’ll spend the green gems you earn during play to purchase items that help you earn more experience, get more perk slots, etc… You also get a free set of boots when it’s first unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no reason to go through any of the game without the free item and access to the market. The sooner you die, the sooner you get the Black Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Check the icons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every ship you board has certain attributes, be it extra loot, a library, platoons of enemies, mazes, and more. Keep a close eye on the choices of ships to board to make sure you know what you’re getting into. If you’re just starting out, or low on HP, avoid platoons, traps, mazes, and anything else that looks or sounds dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/flinthook/bazaar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Shake up your perks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get comfortable with a set of perks, but you’ll be doing yourself a disservice by not shaking it up once and a while. Always change your loadout to see how much easier/harder it makes the game. You may find a different set of perks suits your needs better than you’d think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me? Getting an apple every time I start a new ship didn’t seem like a big deal. It ended up &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; helping me out. The extra HP boost helped me survive a couple more hits that would have had me starting my bounty all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Slow down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Chronobelt is an amazing tool that slows down time and allows you to move through certain obstacles as you make your way through ships. Its usefulness doesn’t stop there, though. Use the Chronobelt when there’s a lot of enemies on the screen to help navigate your way safely through the masses. Slow down time to help avoid various projectiles that tricky sub bosses toss at you, or to better learn the patterns of traps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Take your time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really tempted to zip around each room with your Quickhook as fast as you possibly can. It’s immensely satisfying. Until you’re a master of the hook, take your time! You’ll end up flying into more enemies, spikes, and lasers than you’ll care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With HP at a premium, taking your time and keeping your eyes open will keep you alive much longer and not have you scrambling to find apples or wasting your hard-earned gold on other HP-restoring items.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review/Unboxing - TableTop Campaign Coins</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://campaigncoins.com&quot;&gt;Campaign Coins&lt;/a&gt; have become a huge deal since their first Kickstarter days. The makers of metal gaming coins have released multiple different sets of coins over the years, and I’ve always drooled over them. Now, with TableTop Day fast approaching, Campaign Coins and &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekandsundry.com/&quot;&gt;Geek &amp;amp; Sundry&lt;/a&gt; have teamed up to deliever an amazing T&lt;a href=&quot;http://campaigncoins.com/tabletop-coin-set-51/&quot;&gt;ableTop themed set of coins&lt;/a&gt; designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekandsundry.com/&quot;&gt;Daniel Solis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coins come in four denominations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Copper 1-coin (18mm diameter, about the size of a US dime), featuring a meeple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Silver 5-coin (22mm diameter , similar to a US nickel), showing a hand of cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bronze 20-coin (25mm diameter, about a US quarter), boasting a D20, of course&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gold 100-coin (30mm diameter, larger than a US half dollar), depicting a table set out with a board game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can be purchased a few different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$39.99 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://campaigncoins.com/tabletop-coin-set-51/&quot;&gt;51 Coin Set&lt;/a&gt; (25 Copper, 15 Silver, 10 Bronze, 1 Gold)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$4.50 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://campaigncoins.com/tabletop-1-coin-5/&quot;&gt;5 Copper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$4.50 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://campaigncoins.com/tabletop-5-coin-5/&quot;&gt;5 Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$4.99 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://campaigncoins.com/tabletop-20-coin-5/&quot;&gt;5 Bronze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$6.25 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://campaigncoins.com/tabletop-100-coin-5/&quot;&gt;5 Gold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$4.99 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://campaigncoins.com/tabletop-collector-pack-4/&quot;&gt;Collector Pack&lt;/a&gt; (1 of each coin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campain Coins was nice enough to send me over a 51 Coin Set to take a look at and I was blown away by the quality. The coins come bagged by denomination inside a cloth bag bearing the TableTop logo. They’re all metal, yet lighter than US currency. The level of detail on the coins is absolutely amazing, especially considering the size of the coins. All the imagery is super-sharp and designed to last over time instead of following current design trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling this won’t be the last set of Campaign Coins I ever own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/campaigncoins/ttccoins12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TableTop Campaign Coins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Rose Gaming Accessories Dice Trays</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah-nagl fhtagn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/RosesGamingAcc?ref=condensed_trust_header_title_items&quot;&gt;Rose Gaming Accessories&lt;/a&gt; is a custom woodwork gaming accessory crafter based out of London. They specialize in creating luxury handmade items to enhance your game table. Recently, they sent over several dice trays for us to check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each item pictured here is hand painted, sanded, and finished in beeswax, making each individual dice tray unique. The trays are fashioned from a selection of fine wood and lined with a felt interior. Additionally, each tray has brass corners and bun feet to protect your table. These trays measure 23cm x 14cm x 4cm and sell for approximately $35 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rosegaming/rwgtray1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rose Gaming Trays&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rosegaming/rwgtray2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rose Gaming Trays&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictured here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/514123481/solid-cherry-wood-d20-design?ref=shop_home_active_15&quot;&gt;solid cherry wood tray&lt;/a&gt; with a D20 tooled designed, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/521056235/solid-black-walnut-swords-and-flintlocks?ref=shop_home_active_4&quot;&gt;solid black walnut tray&lt;/a&gt; with a sword and flintlock tooled design, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/494743976/solid-oak-dice-tray-cthulhu?ref=shop_home_active_6&quot;&gt;solid oak tray&lt;/a&gt; with Cthulhu’s chant tooled design. These trays are smooth to the touch and look great. Additionally, the tray makes a gentle, pleasant sound as dice tumble across its felt surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rosegaming/rwgtray3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rose Gaming Trays&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend these trays. They are low-cost, high-quality, and look great. Additionally, Rose Gaming Accessories crafts dice boxes, game chests, and even does custom orders. If you are in the market, they are worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dice Trays were provided free for review by Rose Gaming Accessories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/merchantgreen/tray1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leather Dice Tray&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tray can be unsnapped to lie flat or be rolled for easy transport. With all four corners snapped, a dice tray is formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/merchantgreen/tray2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leather Dice Tray&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is truly a fine, real leather dice tray. It even smells incredible. However, with fine leather comes the need for care. This tray should not be exposed to liquid, extreme heat, or direct sunlight—otherwise, it may discolor or shrink. A light leather conditioner may be used for cleaning. If quality and artistry interest you, then Merchant Green Leather Works is worth a browse.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Micro Review - King of Tokyo: Power Up &amp; Cthulhu Monster Pack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My kids and I are longtime fans of King of Tokyo, though it had fallen out of play rotation a while ago. That all changed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/King-of-Tokyo-2016-Unboxing/&quot;&gt;2016 re-release&lt;/a&gt; of the game. Not only have we been playing again, but IELLO sent over the Power Up! expansion of the new edition along with the Cthulhu Monster Pack. Power Up! is the game as it has always been, just update for the new edition’s art and card backs. Cthulhu, on the other hand, comes with its namesake monster, Power Up! evolution cards for both King of Tokyo and King of New York, and supporting tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who have played Power Up! before know what to expect from the expansion. Each monster gets a set of evolution cards that can be activated at random when 3 hearts are rolled. Evolution cards can have permanent or temporary effects on the the game. It also comes with a giant panda. That’s pretty much worth the entire purchase right there. What’s nice is that the cards really don’t change the game so much where it doesn’t feel like King of Tokyo anymore. They’re well balanced and fit right in with the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cthulhu Monster Pack adds Cthulhu to the game, as well as his evolution cards, madness tokens, and Cultists. Really the only new rule here is that if the Cthulhu player rolls 4-of-a-kind they can add a Cultist Token to the table. At any time the Cultist can be discarded to earn a health, energy, or re-roll a die. Cultists have an added effect in King of New York, but I don’t have that game so I just skimmed past that in the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power Up! is certainly a “must have” for King of Tokyo. Cthulhu is a nice touch if you want extra monsters, or are a Lovecraft fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copies of King of Tokyo: Power Up! and the Cthulhu Monster Pack were provided free for review by IELLO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Crazier Eights: Camelot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/craziereights/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crazier Eights: Camelot&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://craziereights.com/&quot;&gt;Self-Published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://craziereights.com/store/&quot;&gt;$22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 10–30 Min&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 13+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://craziereights.com/crazier-eights-rules/&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209853/crazier-eights-camelot&quot;&gt;Crazier Eights: Camelot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazier Eights: Camelot is a fast-paced revamp of Crazy Eights, the card game classic. Let’s start with what’s inside the box. The box contains 52 playing cards and a set of rules. Additionally, there is a quick-guide rules card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/craziereights/crazy1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crazier Eights: Camelot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. The game progresses in much of the same way as the classic Crazy Eights. Each player begins the game with a hand of seven cards. During a players turn, she draws one card from the deck, attempts to discard a card from her hand (by matching rank or color), and may play one card from her hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each card contains either details of an “event” or an “asset.” Events are one-time use cards with impactful, but temporary, effects. An example might be forcing a player of your choice to skip a turn or allowing the player to discard an additional card. Alternatively, assets are permanent cards that are played on the table in front of the player to affect various game mechanics. For example, as asset may allow a player to discard one additional card per turn or allow the player to prevent a card from being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/craziereights/crazy2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crazier Eights: Camelot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first game was characterized by hesitation. However, the game still progressed in a timely manner. Our second game was much more speedy. The fast-paced design of the game is somewhat refreshing. Nothing is more frustrating than a game that drags on and on into monotony and boredom. A swift game allows from several rounds to be played in one sitting and prevents the game from turning stale too quickly. Additionally, the basic gameplay rules all fit on a single sheet. The rules are straightforward and easy to comprehend, making this a great game for a wide-range of ages. It did not take more than 10 minutes before we were drawing cards and getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a few inconspicuous typos on the game box and card text, the game has a very professional and aesthetic appearance. The card art is colorful, thematic, and appealing. Many card games seem repetitive and one-dimensional. This is not one of them. Crazier Eights: Camelot has replayabilty and I could see this game leaving the shelf often.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Final War: Onslaught</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/finalwar/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Final War&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finalwar.com&quot;&gt;Games Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/219564/final-war&quot;&gt;Final War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first saw Final War at PAX East this year and it was unlike any other CCG I have ever played. The Onslaught Starter Set contains everything you need to play including a board, tokens, and over 200 cards. Games Lab Pty assured me that the game was balanced in a way that a player could get maximum enjoyment out of the Starter Set without having to purchase any other cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/finalwar/factions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Final War Factions&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;The Onslaught Starter Set comes with 3 different Warlords to head players’ decks. The 3 Warlords represent 3 different factions: Good, Neutral, and Evil. Unlike other CCGs where players are in direct conflict, Final War has players building their army while competing with cards in a Fate Deck. The game proceeds this way until the Final War card is played and the players’ armies clash to determine the victor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Units in Final War are placed in spaces on the board. Once the board is filled no more units can be placed. There’s places for your Warlord, regular units, Heroes, and fortifications. Heroes and Warlords can also hold items, while Spells are cast and spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief overview of the game can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1574/8227/files/Quicker_Player_Guide_For_Web.pdf?5307978577551587073&quot;&gt;Quick Rules&lt;/a&gt;, or the full rules linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production value of the Final War: Onslaught Starter Set are incredibly high. The cards are you pretty standard CCG fare, but the large box filled with the boards, rules, dice, and tokens goes above and beyond what your standard CCG starter contains. The box truly contains everything you need to enjoy the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really impressed with how Final War plays. It’s a fresh take on CCGs with quick setup, rapid escalation, and tense gameplay. There’s no mana needed to summon cards and no energy level that increases every turn that’s used to field your army. Strategic placement of cards is important as some cards can buff others in different rows. The Fate Deck keeps players on their toes as they try to bolster their forces for Final War and victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My one complaint is the price tag for the starter set. While you’re getting a lot, $70 is a bit steep as an entry point for a CCG. While you can just purchase boosters, you’re in no way guaranteed to get enough to play even if you bought a booster box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice? See if you can find somewhere to give the game a shot first before you pull the trigger. Fans of CGGs and card battle games are sure to like it, but no sense is risking that kind of money unless you’re sure it’s a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205419/vikings-raid-conquer&quot;&gt;Vikings: Raid &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several games out there right now based on The History Channel’s hit series, Vikings. Being a huge fan of the show I was excited to get a chance to play the latest in the line of licensed games, Vikings: Raid &amp;amp; Conquer. Put out by High Roller Games, Raid &amp;amp; Conquer was produced after a successful Kickstarter run in September of last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raid &amp;amp; Conquer is a deck building game that plays in two phases: Winter and Spring. Winter plays like any standard deck builder where you’re using your cards to purchase more powerful cards from a rotating central market and a few fixed cards. This phase lasts for four full rounds. Then Spring starts and it’s time to raid!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the play phases available to players in Winter are still available in Spring. The difference is that players can now pick an action secretly to take during the turn, then attempt to earn influence and fortune by going on raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different actions available to players are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attack - Attack another player to steal Raid cards from them. You cannot raid if you attack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defend - Protection against direct attacks from other players, though you cannot raid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raid Party - The player with the most influence becomes the Earl and can invite other players who chose Raid Party to raid with them. Players combine power played on the table to take a Raid card for the Earl, while everyone earns some treasure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lone Raid - Players who play down a lot of power can attempt to raid alone. High risk. High reward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the steps has a bit more detail, like raiding not being able to happen unless you’ve played a Longship. You can find the full rules of the game &lt;a href=&quot;https://vikingscardgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Vikings-Rules-Download1.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One a player has 5 Raid cards the game ends and Legend points are tallied. The player is the one with the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a licensed product, all the imagery from the game is taken from the show. While I’m not always a fan of this, most of the stills taken from the show are really well done. The cardstock is nice, and having the large board to keep track of the different card piles and rows is a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have a few quips, though. The text on the cards is presented in all caps. At times it can make them a bit hard to read. Also, the ravens printed on the board used to track the 4 rounds of Winter aren’t really easy to see, and there’s no token or real tracker to place on them. You just place a small clip next to the board to denote which round you’re currently on. Last, the clips used to choose an action on your cardboard player shield cuts a bit into the cardboard. A spinner would have been much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall Vikings: Raid &amp;amp; Conquer is a competent deck builder. It’s nothing amazing and doesn’t really do much to stand out in a genre full of amazing games. It’s by no means bad, however, and I’d highly recommend it for fans of the show or those new to deck building games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raid &amp;amp; Conquer plays quickly, especially once you get a game or two under your belt. Player interaction keeps the game interesting while using the cards to your best advantage for raiding will keep you on your toes and constantly thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vikings: Raid &amp;amp; Conquer is a good game. Fans will get more than just your average licenced game while fans of the deck building genre will find the game familiar and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Atlantis Miniatures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of their new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1636851747/atlantis-miniatures-28mm-dwarf-miniatures&quot;&gt;Dwarf Miniatures Collection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlantisminiatures.com/&quot;&gt;Atlantis Miniatures&lt;/a&gt; sent over a handful of miniatures to check out. I was more than impressed. To begin the models arrived in a professional, unique magnetic box. The models were neatly packed in bubble wrap inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atlantisminis/atlantisminis1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Atlantis Minis 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miniatures are spectacular. For scale, I placed them on my Terrainify gaming mat with 4-inch hexes. The level of detail and quality of the molds is outstanding. All models are 28mm resin models that generally come pre-assembled. Although, some of the larger models—such as the wyvern shown here—require some gluing. Also, like most resin models, a razor is required to eliminate mold lines and imperfections. The resin was nice and soft, so removing any tags here or there was fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atlantisminis/atlantisminis2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Atlantis Minis 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlantis offers a wide variety of miniatures from their various collections—goblins, orcs, trolls, and creatures to name a few. Each miniature comes with a plain black base. However, I replaced the base of one of the models with a base from &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Forge-Prints-Foundations/&quot;&gt;Forge Prints&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forgeprints.com/listing/502382880/30mm-rocky-base-1-pack-of-4&quot;&gt;Rocky Base&lt;/a&gt; collection and it fit perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atlantisminis/atlantisminis3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Atlantis Minis 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These miniatures are pricey, ranging from about $8 for smaller miniatures to upwards of $90 (or more) for sets of larger figures. For example, the war bear shown here costs $11.18 in their online shop and the Wyvern (21.5 cm tall!) costs $68.33. However, you get what you pay for. I can’t emphasize how impressed I was with this sample of miniatures. I can’t wait to get my hands on some of the new Dwarf Collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/cid=UP2059-CUSA07477_00-AAEROGAME1234567?smcid=pdc:us-en:pdc-games-detail-aaero-ps4:leadproductinfo-buy-download:aaero:up2059-cusa07477_00-aaerogame1234567:emcid_null&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/499890/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/store/p/Aaero/BZR51XD70NKD&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $14.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when rhythm-action games were all the rage. Over time, with a lack of spectacular titles, the shine kind of faded on the genre. Mad Fellows set out to change that with Aaero, a twin-stick shooter/rhythm-action game mashup. Published by Reverb Triple XP, Aaero is now available for Steam, Xbox One, and the PS4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Aaero you control a ship and fly through levels Space Harrier style while an amazing dubstep/electronica soundtrack pounds out the rhythm for you to fly by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main things you have to worry about each level. The first is the light ribbon, which you have to follow to rack up points and multipliers. The second is obstacles that you need to avoid. The third is the various enemies you have to destroy. This part is done with the right stick for targeting and a trigger button for firing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all three of these actions are timed to the music. The better you listen, the easier it’ll be to figure out the patterns and perform better on each level. Levels are scored on a 1-5 scale with various amounts of secret targets to destroy in each one. On top of this, there are boss levels that have you trying to best giant creatures before the level ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Aaero is visually impressive with unique landscapes, enemies, colorful lights, and flashing projectiles, it’s the music that really takes center stage. With a fully licensed soundtrack, you’ll be on the edge of your seat cruising your ship through each level while fully immersed in an auditory wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way for me to explain it is for me to show you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaero is one of the best PS4 games I’ve played this year. Impressive visuals, amazing audio, and the satisfaction you get when nailing a particularly hard level combine to create a unique rhythm-action experience that you won’t soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you own a PS4, Xbox One, or use Steam, Aaero is a game you certainly shouldn’t pass up, even if you’re not normally a fan of rhythm-action games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A PS4 copy of Aaero was provided free for review by Reverb Triple XP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Privateer Press' April Releases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the darkness of their nightmarish isles, the undead legions of Cryx strike at the Iron Kingdoms.&lt;/em&gt; Privateer Press’ April Warmachine releases are here and they sent over a few items for us to check out. These items are scheduled for release on April 26, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For decades Kharybdis was lost, believed to have been destroyed when the Cygnaran Navy sank the blackship carrying it. With nothing but a crude map, Captain Aiakos set out to recover this powerful helljack that slumbered in the deep. Kharybdis now terrorizes victims of the warcaster’s bloody raids, tearing anything within reach to pieces.&lt;/em&gt; Kharybdis Heavy Warjack ($59.99) is a highly detailed larger metal and resin model featuring many intertwined tendrils. This heavy-hitter boasts a number of abilities on the battlefield and shares the same general warjack rules as other warjacks. As the personal warjack of Captain Aiakos (PIP 341129), Kharybdis pairs very well with him and gains the Prowl ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/ppapril1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Privateer April Releases 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortenebra is the dark mistress of the Cryxian war industry. With her cold and penetrating mind, she has worked behind the scenes to further the development of the Nightmare Empire’s necromechanikal horrors. Driven to seek insights through the crucible of combat, she has continued to augment her own physical form through iterative reimaginings of her mechanikal frame. Now, with the chance to observe her creations in battle, Mortenebra’s dark mind has been stirred to new and greater heights.&lt;/em&gt; The warcaster, Mortenebra, Numen of Necrogenesis ($37.99) is a highly detailed 50mm base metal and resin model. She is a durable caster unit with a number of unique abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I am impressed by Privateer Press’ printed materials. The Cryx Command book ($34.99) is no exception. This visually stunning Cryx reference manual is chock full of everything you need to know, including: a complete set of rules and profiles for warcasters and warjacks, a selection of units and solos that can form the sinister core of your Cryx army, and a detailed background information on the Nightmare Empire. Additionally, this book includes a detailed painting guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/ppapril2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Privateer April Releases 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vivid illustrations in this book are outstanding. Privateer Press never disappoints with their printed materials. I am certainly looking forward to seeing these items and the rest of the April collection on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/ppapril3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Privateer April Releases 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deathstate: Abyssal Edition Arrives on April 25th for the PS4</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3XFQrFCJr4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bread Machine Games describes Deathstate: Abyssal Edition as the best transdimensional, single-stick, indie, bullet hell roguelike, shooter RPG. Already out on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/402120/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll arrive for the PS4 on April 25th. The PS4 version will be an upgraded version of the game, containing tons of realms, bosses, relics, secrets and features added since the game’s launch on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deathstate: Abyssal Edition is a strange-looking game where you collect organs instead of armor, explore fractured realities instead of dungeons, and fight Lovecraftian horrors instead of fantasy creatures. Inspiration for the game’s world came from The Binding of Isaac, Dark Souls and the Hellraiser movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have a key for the game tomorrow, so key an eye out for a review and some streaming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Warforged: First Contact</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://warforgedfc.com/&quot;&gt;Warforged: First Contact&lt;/a&gt; launches on Kickstarter some time today..  Warforged is a new tactical miniatures game developed by Reforged Studios. With art by Neil Robertson and miniatures crafted by Ninja Division, this game looks to be one worth holding out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warforged is designed to appeal to both miniature collectors and tactical board game players. The game takes place in the distant future, where fearless warriors of the Iron Legion contest the mythical Mantra, a galaxy-spanning covenant of aliens bent on dominating the human race. In this setting, a handful of people—known as the Awoken—have merged with nanotechnology gifting them unprecedented power, such as the ability to hurl lightning, disappear into thin air, or move with preternatural speed. Most of the Awoken serve with the Iron Legion as revered commanders. And, those few who don’t are closely monitored to ensure their gifts are not misused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WGqevdNM4Wg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warforged promises to feature: a unique card deck containing relevant gameplay information for each warrior, innovative power tokens, three unique sets of dice, a scalable exploration mode, and an award system. Additionally, stretch goals and special offers featured in the Kickstarter campaign will introduce a multitude of supplementary game content, including a third faction of human rebels called The Uprising. Boasting the track records of both Reforged Studios and Ninja Division, it is difficult to imagine Warforged as being anything but both visually stunning and fun to play. I am definitely looking forward to following the development of this game and to one day getting my hands on a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ALPHA Table Q&amp;A With Joe Rybinski of Firmer Terra, LLC</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/alpha/joe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Joe Rybinski&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://firmerterra.com&quot;&gt;Firmer Terra, LLC&lt;/a&gt;, makers of the ALPHA Game Table, were kind enough to send me one of their tables for review. Joe Rybinski, Managing Member of the company, was also kind enough to answer some of my questions about the table in a quick email Q&amp;amp;A. The ALPHA Table is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://firmerterra.com/purchase-now/&quot;&gt;available to order&lt;/a&gt; for $189.99. Here’s the transcript of our Q&amp;amp;A. My review of the table will follow shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did the idea for the Alpha Table first come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our group was looking for a good play space outside of the game store for about 4 years now.  We tried crafting our own tables at first but ran into space and spouse issues.  So, after we put down the saws and the plywood, we decided to search for an alternative that could be stowed away with the rest of the gear.  Surprisingly, no one offered the dimensions we needed (namely a 6x4 or larger).  The natural next step was to buy two tables and join them but after an accident that cost many models their arms and legs, we went back to the drawing board.  Also, two tables were a pain to line up on carpeting.  At that point, we had to get creative with manufacturing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the production timeline like? How many prototypes did you go through, and what are some of the changes to the table made along the way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We approached about a dozen manufacturers with our needs.  Half of them were willing to work with our idea.  We then purchased a sample of each product and started evaluating it in house and in a focus group of sorts.  At first trial the original ALPHA concept was going to be a 3 fold table that weighed over 75 lbs.  This unit could still slide under a bed or a sofa but was pretty much stuck in whatever room you wanted your game space.  Also, you needed 20 minutes of set–up time and a small handyman tool set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then one starry night, after considerable amounts of fermented barley, I had the idea of being able to host a game while grilling outside.  The whole process was started over, but this time with 3 set goals in mind.  The ALPHA had to tuck away when not in use, it also had to be lightweight enough to move by your-self, and it had to be pretty resistant to weather (versatile, portable, lightweight).  That’s when I began using my10 year—old daughter as the standard of complexity.  If she could set this thing up, take it down, and move it 20 yards we had a success.  The rest of the process was adding and subtracting structural and stabilizing aspects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the overall timeline from concept to the final product?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From first concept of manufacture to finally placing my hands on a ready ALPHA, I’d say about 26 months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you go about spreading the word for your IndieGoGo campaign? Why IndieGoGo over Kickstarter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I actually did go with Kickstarter at first.  The initial idea to crowdfund was set up in Summer of 2016.  The idea was presented but at that time we had a working model and not the full scale prototype.  Someone accused us of reselling an existing product.  This was blatantly wrong but by that time Kickstarter pulled the campaign.  There was no way to restart on there even after explaining and presenting my case.  That was a very depressing weekend.  Witnessing an idea get such great support just to have the rug pulled out from under.  In all honesty, I was just going to give up, but the amount of moral support that came in from the funders was what got me to look at other sources of funding.  I spent the next 2 months vetting every single part of an Indiegogo campaign with the folks at Indiegogo.  After they gave me the green light, I relaunched there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of the marketing was done through Facebook advertising.  It’s a challenge spreading the word.  Again, the gamer community is an unnatural beast; I’ve met so many supportive and positive people over the past year.  At this point I’m thankful that I did push this project to completion.  I’ve received tons of positive feedback and I’ve had the opportunity to just shoot the breeze with fellow gamers.  People know that they are free to call me or email me with their experience whether it is ALPHA related or not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any other tables in the works? Ideas for an ALPHA V2? ALPHA accessories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are working on a concept.  Probably will not be out until 2018.  Now mostly just aesthetics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you’d like to cover before we wrap up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d like to thank you for conducting the interview.  I hope that people realize this is a project of passion rather than profit.  I want to share a solution to a gaming need.  Our feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and I will continue to strive to contribute to the community and make new friends along the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Curled Paw Creatives Tokens</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Based out of Birmingham, Alabama, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/CurledPawCreatives?ref=l2-shopheader-name&quot;&gt;Curled Paw Creatives&lt;/a&gt; makes a number of high-quality acrylic tokens for Star Wars: Destiny and Star Wars: X-Wing. Andrew Nuckols and Hollie Baker oversee this graphic design studio specializing in creating custom canvas wraps and original design. All tokens are professionally laser cut in house and all of the artwork is original. Shown here are a few examples of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/curledpawcreatives/cpc1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Curled Paw Creatives Tokens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/286850227/acrylic-shield-tokens?ref=shop_home_active_5&quot;&gt;Acrylic Shield Tokens&lt;/a&gt; set for Star Wars: X-Wing comes in sets of 5 or 10 ($3.50 or $7.00). The tokens are printed on light-blue transparent acrylic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/curledpawcreatives/cpc2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Curled Paw Creatives Tokens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/496163329/acrylic-large-shield-set?ref=shop_home_active_5&quot;&gt;Acrylic Large Shield Token&lt;/a&gt; set is printed on the same light-blue transparent acrylic and comes in sets of 5 or 10 ($4.00 or $8.00). Alternatively, Curled Paw Creatives offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/480704470/acrylic-split-shield-set?ga_search_query=resource&amp;amp;ref=shop_items_search_5&quot;&gt;Split Shield&lt;/a&gt; Set. This set comes with 3 sets of transparent Light-blue tokens (9 tokens total). Each section of the shield can be removed to represent falling or gaining of shields to add some thematic play to your game. Just be careful no to misplace these small pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/curledpawcreatives/cpc3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Curled Paw Creatives Tokens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Star Wars: Destiny &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/494200331/acrylic-resource-token-set?ga_search_query=resource&amp;amp;ref=shop_items_search_2&quot;&gt;Acrylic Resource Token Set&lt;/a&gt; comes in sets of 6 or 12 ($4.00 or $8.00) and is printed on either transparent dark red or yellow acrylic. These tokens can also be used in Star Wars: Imperial Assault as a substitute for your crate tokens. The tokens are highly detailed and beautiful. Curled Paw Creatives ships all of their acrylic items with the protective backing on to keep the tokens protected during shipment. You can see an example of this in the image showing the yellow and red resource token sets. This gives you the option to customize your product in any color you desire. Just peel the backing off with your fingernail or toothpick (don’t worry, it won’t scratch the acrylic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/curledpawcreatives/cpc4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Curled Paw Creatives Tokens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/494199755/acrylic-damage-counter-set?ga_search_query=resource&amp;amp;ref=shop_items_search_1&quot;&gt;Acrylic Damage Counter Set&lt;/a&gt; includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five 1 Damage Counters (Transparent Yellow or Orange)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three 3 Damage Counters (Transparent Orange)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two 5 Damage Counters (Transparent Red)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tokens are great for Star Wars: Destiny or any other game that counts hit points or damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/curledpawcreatives/cpc5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Curled Paw Creatives Tokens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also make an Acrylic Token Set for Star Wars: The Card Game. This set includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ten 10 Damage counters (orange)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three 30 Damage counters (orange)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three 50 Damage (dark red)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two 100 Damage (dark red)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One Bandage marker (dark red)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One Poison marker (dark green)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These token sets represent high-quality printing on laser-cut thick acrylic. They are a great replacement to the cardboard base token sets that come with your game. Compared to many printed acrylic token sets, they are very low-cost. Check out Curled Paw Creatives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - MoonQuake Escape</title>

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175516/moonquake-escape&quot;&gt;MoonQuake Escape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prison-planet Zartaclaton is doomed. A giant moonquake has given the plant’s prisoners a chance to race to the last escape shuttle and escape. Only one can make it off the planet. The rest? They’re just as doomed as Zartaclaton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escape won’t be that easy, though. The planet is shifting as it dies, represented by a 3D board with rotating layers. There’s also a guard to take into account, and various environmental hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each round of MoonQuake escape has the following 4 phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MoonQuake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Escape&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Action&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoonQuake phase is when charges (actions per turn) are decided by a moon spin. The quake die is also spun for each layer and the layers are rotated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Escape phase has players moving their aliens up a layer if they’re still hidden, or grabbing more cards if revealed. Also, any hidden cards on the table can be rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Action phase is where players spend their charges to move, play cards, draw cards, peek at another player’s cards, or reveal another player’s cards. This is the real meat of the game where bluffing and careful card play pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guard phase has the guard progressing through the board and zapping players when getting the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first player to the shuttle wins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this was the most brief overview of the basic rules. There’s also advanced rules with enviornmental effects, advanced guard rules, and more. To get a better feel for the game, watch the video below or check out the full rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135620/moonquake-rules-2016&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oAR2gEaY1vU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/moonquake/pic2829125_md.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MoonQuake Setup&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;The main gimmick of MoonQuake Escape calls for a pretty detailed board setup. The board is made of several cardboard rings and bases to that each level can spin as needed. The plastic arm also connects to the lower base for the moon spinner. It’s really impressive once completely set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the main disc holder’s placement hex wasn’t attached to my copy. Thankfully designer Jeff Johnston told me how to fix it, and a little extra strength glue fixed the issue. Jeff assured me that future copies of the game will fix this issue. Currently, my board is working like a charm, so no complaints here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the board, the rest of MoonQuake’s charm comes from it’s cartoony, highly colorful artwork. It’s very approachable for both kids and adults. Combine that with the spinning board and you’ve got a quality end product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen MoonQuake Escape demoed by Jeff at several conventions now but hadn’t actually played it myself until recently. The first time I sat down with it was with my 10-year-old daughter using the basic rules. We both loved it! The rotating board is super cool, but the bluffing and deduction aspect of the cards was the real draw for us. Moving onto the advanced rules with environmental effects made the game more fun, more strategic, and really wasn’t much more complicated than the easier rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I will mention there’s a bit of randomness to the game that comes with spinning for charges and rolling to determine layer movements. While these can be frustrating, they fit in well with the theme of the game. There’s also some clever card play that can give you a bit more control over the outcomes of both the spin and the roll. In the end is the little bit of randomness a deal breaker? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoonQuake Escape is a great family game that I can highly recommend. The board is cool, the rules are simple, and the gameplay is fun. There’s nothing like catching one of your kids in a bluff and exposing their alien. Of course the bitter sting of defeat when they do the same to you can be a bit much. Mostly because it happens a lot more to me than it does to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a lot of fun, and a lot of laughs, with this game. Will we keep coming back to Zartaclaton? Well, it’s &lt;em&gt;not Alcatraz&lt;/em&gt;. I can see us playing MoonQuake Escape for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dungeon Werks Dice Accessories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the same vein of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Kentucky-Sawdust-Dice-Tray-Review/&quot;&gt;my recent post&lt;/a&gt; reviewing Kentucky Sawdust’s spectacular dice trays, I decided to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/DungeonWerksGA?ref=l2-shopheader-name&quot;&gt;Dungeon Werks&lt;/a&gt;. Based out of Claremore, Oklahoma, Dungeon Werks makes a number handmade custom wood gaming products. Shown here are three examples of their craftsmanship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/491228905/7-red-oak-high-side-dice-tray-with-high?ref=shop_home_active_10&quot;&gt;7” Red Oak High Side Dice Tray with High Density foam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/109438161/red-oak-dice-tower-with-choice-of-suede?ref=shop_home_active_4&quot;&gt;Red Oak Dice Tower with choice of suede or foam liner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/488745625/suede-leather-collapsible-dice-tray?ref=shop_home_feat_1&quot;&gt;Suede Leather Collapsible Dice Tray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dungeonwerks/dw1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dungeon Werks Tray&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tray and tower are constructed from smooth red oak and high-density foam. The tray’s sides are 1.5” high and are sanded to a smooth finish. The tray is shipped unstained. Dungeon Werks offers 25 different foam color options to customize your tray. Additionally, the tray has foam feet to protect your furniture. The tray sells for $19.75. I threw a few dice around during a late-night game of Imperial Assault and they glided smoothly across the tray surface, settling nicely with little bounce that might result in a lost die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dungeonwerks/dw2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dungeon Werks Tower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was particularly impressed with the tower. The tower sells for $35 (if using a foam floor) and $40 if using a suede leather floor. With three ramps and a tray covered with your choice of high-density foam or soft suede leather, this ensures your dice bounce, roll, and stay on the table, keeping your game moving smoothly. The tower is made from the same quality materials as the tray and measures approximately 3 1/4” W x 3 1/4” D x 6” T. One thing I found particularly cool is that the tower lays down in its tray for easy storage. The tray is slightly larger (to fit the tower) with 1” high sides and foam feet to protect your furniture. Both items are sanded to a smooth finish. Like the tray, the tower is shipped unstained with your choice of foam color or suede leather (for an extra $5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dungeonwerks/dw3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dungeon Werks Leather Tray&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collapsible suede leather dice tray is pretty handy. It unbuttons and rolls up so it can travel with you to a friend’s house for game night. Each tray is made from soft suede leather and measures about 8” x 8”. Once the snaps are secured to form the tray, you will have about a 5” x 5” rolling surface, with a nice lip to prevent the dice from making an escape. One thing that makes Dungeon Werks’ leather trays unique is that they are made from 100% real leather, creating the possibility for flaws and even some branding, making your tray authentic and one-of-a-kind. 
While these items are not as flashy as some of the other wood gaming accessories on the market, they have a nice rustic, genuine look and feel to them and the quality is top notch. They are also slightly smaller, allowing them to fit on most tables. Check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Dead Man's Doubloons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/deadmansdoubloons/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dead Man's Doubloons&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gotgeniusgames.com&quot;&gt;Thundergryph Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Minimum Pledge:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gonab/dead-mans-doubloons&quot;&gt;€39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://thundergryph.com/DMD/dmd_rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201509/dead-mans-doubloons&quot;&gt;Dead Man’s Doubloons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gonab/dead-mans-doubloons/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead Man’s Doubloons has been on my radar for quite some time now. I played a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Dead-Mans-Doubloons-Tabletop-Simulator/&quot;&gt;very early prototype&lt;/a&gt; over Tabletop Simulator with the game’s designer, Jason Miceli, back in July of last year. I’ve followed its progress landing a publisher, Thundergryph Games, and have been eagerly awaiting both it’s announcement and Kickstarter launch. Well, that time has come and Jason invited me over to give the latest version of the game a shot. A lot has changed since my last play and it’s all for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead Man’s Doubloons is a thematic pirate game where players race to the treasure and then head back to their ships for a final, battle royale. It’s a game played on two fronts simultaneously. Your pirate’s ship circles the cursed island fighting and boarding other ships, plundering the island and looking for pieces of the treasure map. Your captain, on the other hand, is frantically trying to make their way to the treasure at the top Zotètmon Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just the first phase of the game. Once a pirate reaches the top it’s a scramble to escape with your ill-gotten booty alive. A final battle between all the pirate ships takes place until one captain can outmaneuver the others and claim the most treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of variables that do into this mad dash and gunpower-filled pirate dance. Players must have 2 pieces of the map before their pirate can start walking one of the 3 paths to
Zotètmon Mountain. Pirates who have matching map pieces can also follow in their footsteps whenever they move. The 3 paths also have different aspects to them. The red path is the shortest, but more dangerous path. The yellow path is the longest but will provide the most riches. The blue path is in between and can help you hire on replacement crew or repair your ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the sea battle being waged. The board has 4 sections where the ships trade cannon fire. Each section has an attribute that can help, or hinder, your ship’s progress. Sink an enemy’ ship and it becomes a ghost ship that can’t move, but has some nasty retaliatory power. There’s also crew to kill, doubloons to steal, and all sorts of other nasty ways to slow your opponents down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of Dead Man’s Doubloons actions are pre-programmed each round with 3 cards played face down by the players. Each turn players flip over a card and play that action, the player with initiative going first. Cards have up to 2 ship movement actions, either optional or forced, and a choice of two actions to take. Actions such as hunting for treasure maps/moving your captain on the island, firing your ship’s cannons, boarding other ships, plundering the island, and repairing your ship can be taken this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all is said and done players score by the number of gems they’ve collected from the mountain or stolen from other players, their doubloons, the available crew left on their ship, and map fragments to see who’s the richest pirate in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t really comment much on the physical components of the game since this was just a prototype. I can comment on the artwork and layout of the game, which is both colorful and full of pirate theme. It’s amazing to see how much love and detail has been put into every aspect of the design from the pirates to their ships, the island, and even the cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final game will have plastic pirate ships, and even translucent ghost ships, as well as wooden meeples with the captain’s images printed onto them. There’ll be metal coins, tarot-sized cards, and all sorts of high production value Thundergryph Games has made themselves well known for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/deadmansdoubloons/pieces.png&quot; alt=&quot;Concept&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a huge fan of Dead Man’s Doubloons since the first time I played. It’s fast, even with a full compliment of players, fun, and so full of pirate theme that you’ll be grabbing booty (heh) and talking like a pirate within a few short turns into the game. The changes I’ve seen from when I played in July and the latest prototype streamline the game while providing players with meaningful choices, all while keeping the game into that 1-hour sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much to love about Dead Man’s Doubloons, and I certainly think it’s one to back. The game was funded in only 5 hours after the campaign launched and is now onto smashing through its stretch goals. Knowing Thundergryph that’ll mean higher quality components, and maybe some cool game content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Who am I kidding. I know some of what’s coming for the game if it raises enough, and let’s just say I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hoping it does. There’s tons of cool content in store)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pizza and wine were provided during my play of the prototype by Jason Miceli.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Terrainify Gaming Mats</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been on the hunt for a solid game mat. Placing delicate cardboard game tiles directly on your kitchen table inevitably leads to scratching. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/people/johncasiello1337&quot;&gt;John Casiello&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/Terrainify&quot;&gt;Terrainify&lt;/a&gt; was generous enough to send over a few mats for me to check out. Terrainify makes a number of game mats in various sizes and patterns and also has a great line of matching “scatter terrain.” The terrain is highly detailed and looks excellent, but comes with a weighty price tag. However, Terrainify’s game mats are on the more affordable side, compared with other game mats on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/terrainify/terrainify1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Terrainify Game Mat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mats come in a variety of sizes, from a smaller 2’ x 3’ to a larger 4’ x 8’ mat.  All mat artwork is original and each mat is printed on heavy-duty 16 oz. PVC vinyl, making it both attractive and durable. PVC vinyl is a thinner material, so the mat will lie flat on your table and not have a soft, depressed feel like mats printed on mouse pad material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/terrainify/terrainify2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Terrainify Game Mat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mats are “printed to order,” so they take about two weeks from order to delivery. My mats arrived safely packaged in three separate shipping tubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/terrainify/terrainify3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Terrainify Game Mat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of image options, including urban, natural, and space designs. Additionally, Terrainify offers a square or hex grid print in the size of your choice, if desired. The grid option is great if you are playing war games or if you are into game design and need a game board that can be easily rolled and transported for play-testing. If you are looking for a great, cheaper mat, check out Terrainify. Also, check out &lt;a href=&quot;file:///Users/rkalajian/Downloads/gamermulticlass.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Casiello’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, he has a few handy tutorials and a pretty rad miniatures gallery. Now, I just need a new game table to fit these giant mats.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RPG Jelly Plush Kickstarter Q&amp;A</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rpgjelly/alainaprana.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alaina&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;I heard about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1701549395/rpg-jelly-plush-kickstarter&quot;&gt;RPG Jelly Plush Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; via an email announcement with an offer to do an interview, etc.. Loving a) plush toys, b) RPGs, and c) jellyfish, I figured “why the hell not?” What followed was a series of email with Alaina Prana, The Floof Queen, who designed and currently hand-makes these awesome jellies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What inspired your RPG Jellyfish plushies? How did they come to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At first, I was inspired by the anime Princess Jellyfish to make the first batch of plush jellies. The original pattern I designed was my own take on one of the characters from that show. I loved making the character so much that I decided to branch out and create some of my own from that original design. They are SUPER fun to design and I love making them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea of applying RPG elements to them wasn’t hard to come up with, since I grew up on those things - as a result, the Warrior types are some of my favorites, since that’s what I tend to play the most. The designs come from fantasy stereotypes, classic RPG classes, and bad puns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned these are hand-made. About how long does each take to produce?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They can take anywhere from 3-6 hours a piece, individually. It depends on the complexity and how many I’m doing at once - I think I made 40 over the course of 10 days once, almost constant working. It’s hard to keep EXACT track, my crafting schedule is near constant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a LOT of work! How did you start marketing the plushies? What made you decide to take the next step into manufacturing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lots and lots of conventions. Convention travelling is my main form of getting around and getting product out. I had noticed a couple of other artists I came across during my travels had original plush designs - and I kept it as an idea in mind for ‘maybe someday’. …The problem is plush making IS a lot of work!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rpgjelly/tons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TONS of plush&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The biggest factor here, honestly, is time, and wanting to be able to expand without killing my body. I’ve ended up suffering from overworked induced infections more than once, and my arms require constant attention to keep pushing the way I do. But - I LOVE my designs. I love making things, but I also just adore DESIGNING plushies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other factor is less of a restriction on more complex designs. I don’t feel that I could pull of a Narwhal plush at a price I would find fair. But a manufactured design…they can do a lot more at a fair price for what I want to produce.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many different designs will be available through the Kickstarter campaign?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first two, the Paladin and Rogue jelly, we self funded and are available as backer rewards. Our Mage is the first goal, and then our two stretch goals are the Narwhal Warlock and Bard jellies - a total of 5 designs, assuming EVERYONE gets funded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What future plushies can we look forward too in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future plushies? Well I would really like to expand to a few other more complex sea creature designs based on the same themes - some of my ideas include Devil Squids, ‘Orc’a Whales, and Dragon Turtles! I’d like to keep some jellies though, I would love to see the Witch Jelly be a manufactured product someday!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rpgjelly/convention.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Convention Jelly&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your upcoming con schedule look like? Where can people go to see the jellies up close and personal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do conventions all year round, as many as I’m physically able, though I tend to stick to places close to home for travel cost reasons. I’m based in Ohio, and we put up our convention schedule regularly on our website, tumblr, and Facebook. This year we have UBcon, Anime Park, OMG!con, Indy Pop Con, Glass City Con, Anime Iowa, and Kentokyocon confirmed so far!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds great! Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RPG Jelly Plush Kickstarter can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1701549395/rpg-jelly-plush-kickstarter&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A plush of your choice can be snagged with a $30 pledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yu-Gi-Oh! Release - Starter Deck: Link Strike</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yu-gi-oh/YS16_Tuck_Mock-EN.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Link Strike Deck&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;New on the horizon for the Yu-Gi-Oh! CCG is &lt;strong&gt;Starter Deck: Link Strike&lt;/strong&gt; featuring new Link Monsters that give you control over where you can play your cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link Monsters start the game in your Extra Deck and you Link Summon them by sending face-up monsters you control to the Graveyard. Every Link Monster will tell you exactly what kind of monsters you need to sacrifice and how many to. Link Monsters don’t have a Level or Rank, or even a DEF stat. They can never be face-down or in Defense Position. They’re always face-up and in Attack Position so you always know where their arrows point. Arrows on the Link Monster are important because they point out the Monster Zones on the field they are link to. Depending on their effects, a Link Monster could gain ATK for every monster in a zone it points to, or protect any monster in a zone it points to from being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Link Monsters you can also control different monsters summoned from your Extra Deck. Adjacent Monster Zones a Link Monster’s arrows point to are available to summon new monsters. The trick is to get as many arrows pointing at your own zones as you can while avoiding pointing to your opponent’s zones. This adds a new level of strategy to Yu-Gi-Oh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starter Deck: Link Strike&lt;/strong&gt; comes with 3 new, all-foil Link Monsters to add to your Extra Deck, plus a full Main Deck and a new Game Mat showing the new Extra Monster Zones. This set also introduces a brand-new Type of monster to join Dragons, Warriors, Spellcasters, and all the rest. Inspired by networking machinery, this new Type of monster takes today’s digital technology and turns it into Dueling technology!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starter Deck: Link Strike&lt;/strong&gt; contains 43 cards: 38 Common Cards, 2 Ultra Rare Cards, 3 Super Rare Cards, 1 Beginner’s Guide, and 1 updated Game Mat with new Extra Monster Zones. It will hit store shelves on July 21st, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Knot Dice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knotdice/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Knot Dice&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Matthew O’Malley &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackoakgames.com/collections/knot-dice&quot;&gt;Black Oak Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackoakgames.com/collections/knot-dice/products/knot-dice&quot;&gt;$29.95&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackoakgames.com/collections/knot-dice/products/knot-dice-deluxe&quot;&gt;$57.95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135812/knot-dice&quot;&gt;Knot Dice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Black Oak Games sent over a deluxe set of Knot Dice for review. Knot Dice is the first game published by Black Oak Games. Originally funded by a Kickstarter campaign, the basic Knot Dice set retails for $29.95 and comes with 18 custom dice that form Celtic knot designs, with which you can play a large number of games and puzzles. However, I had the opportunity to check out a deluxe set, which retails for $57.95 and contains 36 dice and a cloth dice bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knotdice/knotdice1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Knot Dice 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unboxing the game reveals several game components: 36 dice, 8 wooden tokens, 1 cloth bag, 1 game book, and 1 puzzle book. Much of the game’s artistic flare is found in the dice themselves. The dice are beautifully crafted, emerald-colored cubes that are slightly larger than your standard playing die. Each die has a translucent shimmering quality, giving them a bit of depth. Silvery inset lines form Celtic knot designs across each surface of the dice. These knots are used to form patterns during gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knotdice/knotdice2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Knot Dice 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began by selecting a game from the book that could be played with two people called “Knot so Fast.” The goal of the game is to collect the most dice by forming closed knots faster than your opponents. After a few rounds we began to get the hang of it. The game book is very straightforward and easy to read and comprehend. The rules are simplified and explained using a number of color diagrams. You can also find videos explaining 12 of the games’ rules on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVcGGWlOhEQw_O9fSetm2nqlhFa9D4Kfb&quot;&gt;Black Oak Games YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. Although, it felt repetitive at times, the game was fast-paced and short lived—a nice quality, which helped to keep our interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/knotdice/knotdice3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Knot Dice 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing another game titled “A Celtic Yarn,” where players compete to form a weaving knot pattern on a grid of dice, we moved on to some puzzles. The puzzle book was definitely my favorite of the two. Building the puzzles contained in the books felt fun and rewarding. If puzzle games are not for you, then this game is likely not your thing. However, Knot dice is certainly an easy-to-learn game that can be picked up by anyone at the table. It is a bit pricey, however, this versatile, hands-on game would undoubtedly be fun with some friends and a few rounds of drinks and would also make excellent mid-air entertainment. Whether or not you have Celtic roots, Knot Dice is a fun way to spend an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Anachrony</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Anachrony had a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign and is finally available for retail sale. The game comes in a huge box weighing in at a total of 10 pounds, all cardboard. While you can purchase minis for the game separately, I’ve jut got the base set. It hasn’t hit the table yet, but I’m really hoping to get it there soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, this is the first time I’m trying taking pictures on my Alpha Table. There was a bit of a reflection on the surface in some pictures, so I don’t know how well it will work out for future photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, let’s dig in and see what comes inside this monster of a game!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forge Prints Foundations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forgeprints.com/&quot;&gt;Forge Prints&lt;/a&gt; is an outfit that I am particularly excited about. Their unique collection of resin minis pairs well with many tabletop games. In anticipation of their new Kickstarter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1613044699/foundations-4-rise-of-the-mimics/description&quot;&gt;Foundations 4: Rise of the Mimics&lt;/a&gt;, Forge Prints sent over a few samples of their Foundations 3 collection. You can pick up most of these items (and a lot more) on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forgeprints.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or at their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/ForgePrints?ref=pr_shop_more&quot;&gt;Etsy shop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/forgeprints/forgeprints1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Forge Prints Foundations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will let the photos do most of the talking. Forge Prints offers a number of highly detailed science fiction and fantasy bases and dungeon scenery. These minis come packaged professionally and may be purchased painted or unpainted. Additionally, they are low-cost, making them a great go-to if you are looking to take your 2D game board up a level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/forgeprints/forgeprints2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Forge Prints Foundations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most resin models do, the minis have a number of mold lines and connector chunks where the models attach to the sprue (although the majority come sprue-free). However, the resin is very soft and can easily be sculpted with a razor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rock worm was one of my favorites. Assembly was easy, a small amount of glue, and the model looks great. The connecting pieces needed to be shaved with a razor slightly to fit properly—not uncommon for resin minis—and some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Green-Stuff-Kneadatite-sculpting-Painter/dp/B001AE5ZQO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1491625917&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=green+stuff&quot;&gt;Army Painter’s Green Stuff&lt;/a&gt; is needed to fill the connecting gap (which is visible in the photo). Once assembled, the rock worm looks great even without paint. These minis are outstanding. If you are trying to decide which Kickstarter to back, check these guys out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/momodora/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Momodora&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bombservice.com&quot;&gt;Bombservice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://playism-games.com&quot;&gt;Playism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/428550/&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/momodora-reverie-under-the-moonlight-ps4/&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/momodora-reverie-under-the-moonlight/bpkqz245cq2h&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $9.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th game in the Momodora series that released at the end of last year on Windows and just recently on the PS4 and Xbox One. It’s a bit darker than the previous entries, yet still, retains the feel of its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momodora is a 2D Metroidvania, which means players have a semi-open map that can gradually be explored more and more when new abilities are found or certain bosses defeated. Players take the role of a priestess named Kaho who is trying to solve the mystery of a curse that is spreading over the land. Armed only with a leaf (melee attack) and a bow (ranged attack) you must make your way through each area to defeat increasingly difficult bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/momodora/lubella.png&quot; alt=&quot;Momodora Screens&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Lubella, a rather large boss and featured character in much of the game’s art&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the main style of play is similar to many other games of this genre, the combat and difficulty fall a bit in line with Dark Souls. Kaho can roll to dodge enemies, or get behind them, and has a health bar that depletes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; quickly with only a few hits. Similar to Dark Souls’ Estus Flask, Kaho has flowers that can restore her heath. These restore at each save point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverie Under the Moonlight combines a despair-inducing world with bouncy and cute characters in wonderful pixel art reminiscent of 90’s console gaming. While it takes a bit getting used to on large, HD screens, it’s a pleasant visual experience with a soundtrack that fits the black mood of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/momodora/mood.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mood&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;It’s this oppressive mood that is shining star of Reverie Under the Moonlight. A mood that is presented through the environment and conversations with NPCs. One of my favorite examples of mood-building takes place in the screenshot to the right. As you walk through this room you find a terrified woman sobbing and asking for help. Later, when you return to the room she’s gone. In her place is a blood stain on the floor. It’s these dark, sometimes disturbing, touches that really draw you into the world Momodora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of audio, visuals, and subtle storytelling, Momodora has the complete package when it comes to presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tight controls, a dark and brooding storyline, and classic Metroidvania action, Momodora is certainly worth the $10 it costs. While it certainly has its flaws, like it’s difficulty, slim pickings on enemies/upgrades, and a love affair with pits full of spikes, Momodora delivers a solid performance overall with its mix of Metroid-like exploration and combat like a paired down Dark Souls.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A New Mythical Pokémon, Marshadow, Has Been Revealed</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemon/marshadow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Marshadow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Mythical Pokémon has been discovered in Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon: Marshadow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marshadow cannot be encountered in normal gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details are on the way soon, including how you can get this Pokémon in your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had more for you, but that’s it for now!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>InspiredCraftwork Follow-up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/InspiredCraftwork-Imperial-Assault-Tokens-Storage-Review/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I had mentioned InspiredCraftwork’s search tokens for Fantasy Flight’s Descent and squad and activation tokens for Star Wars: Imperial Assault. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/people/DerickHui&quot;&gt;Derick Hui&lt;/a&gt; of InspiredCraftwork sent a few sets my way, so I thought I would do a short follow-up post showing them off.&lt;/p&gt;

They cost $11.50 and $18, respectively. Each color comes with three squad markers and three matching activation tokens. The set of three comes in red, green, and blue. The set of five adds yellow and purple to the mix. The squad markers fit neatly underneath the bases of your models and are numbered to differentiate your various units on the map. The activation tokens can be flipped over to indicate unit activation.&lt;/p&gt;

The tokens have removable tops to hide any sort of marker inside to designate the unique search token when required. They measure roughly 20mm square and are compatible with 28mm scale games. The set comes in your choice of flat or round lids and cost $12 or $15, respectively. These token sets are a great, low-cost way to spice up your board.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Loaded Dice Designs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Piggybacking off &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/InspiredCraftwork-Imperial-Assault-Tokens-Storage-Review/&quot;&gt;my recent post&lt;/a&gt; highlighting custom tokens for Star Wars: Imperial Assault, I thought another post was appropriate. Last week, I got my hands on a set of custom 3D-printed tokens made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/LoadedDiceDesigns?ref=l2-shopheader-name&quot;&gt;Loaded Dice Designs&lt;/a&gt;. Based in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, Loaded Dice Designs prints a number of game components and token organizers for various tabletop games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/loadeddicedesigns/ldd1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Loaded Dice Designs 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pick these bad boys up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/269827965/star-wars-imperial-assault-custom-door?ref=shop_home_feat_1&quot;&gt;Etsy.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CX4WVYS/ref=s9_acsd_hps_bw_c_x_1_w&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; for about $30. The set includes: four door tokens, eight terminal tokens, and eight loot crates. These tokens are high-quality prints. What really impressed me is the way they use the base set terminal and door tokens to fuse with the original components making these prints blend right in with the Fantasy Flight materials. These tokens look great without any painting or special attention. Recently, I have been on the hunt for ways to spruce up the Imperial Assault game board. This is certainly one of my favorite custom-printed sets on the market. It is a little pricier than some of the other sets out there, but it is well worth the extra coin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Planetarium</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’d been eagerly awaiting getting my hands on a copy of Game Salute’s Planetarium for some time now. Thankfully I was able to take one home with me from PAX East! The game is absolutely stunning and I can’t wait to get it to the table. Until then here some pictures of its unboxing. Note that my box had the Sci-Fi Pack #1 in it. I’m not quite sure if it comes with all retail versions of the game or not. It’ll be the last picture in the set (the one with sandworms!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Pasiphilo Paper Minis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Joe Nittoly of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/Pasiphilo?ref=condensed_trust_header_title_items&quot;&gt;Pasiphilo&lt;/a&gt; shared two sets of his latest paper minis: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gaminggeek.ca/shop/miniatures/barbarians/&quot;&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gaminggeek.ca/shop/miniatures/rogues/&quot;&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt;.  Die-cut and double-sided with original front and back artwork, these 28mm fantasy cardstock gaming miniatures are an inexpensive and easy-to-assemble alternative to metal or plastic minis for your RPG campaigns or tabletop wargames. Just slot them into the bases provided and you’re ready to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pasiphilo/paperminis1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paper Minis Packaging&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to six round transparent stands, the Rogue set includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A female dungeon delver equipped with climbing harness, grappling hook  and short sword&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A male halfling thief holding lockpicks and a compromised padlock, armed with a dagger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A female swashbuckler in leather armour, armed with saber&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A male assassin in hood and cowl, brandishing twin daggers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A female acrobat/tumbler in alluring garb with bracers and dagger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A male diplomat/spy garbed in noble finery with a dagger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pasiphilo/paperminis2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paper Minis Rogues&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Barbarian set includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A duel-wielding female wild elf forest barbarian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A male Norse/Viking style marauder with war axe and shield&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A tough but beautiful Amazon with longbow and shortsword&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A classic Conan-inspired male half-orc barbarian with maul&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A tribalistic male human plains warrior with spear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A robust and curvy female half-orc barbarian with battleaxe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pasiphilo/paperminis3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paper Minis Barbarians&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is great about these paper minis is the unique artwork and attention to detail. The minis are double-sided, showing each figures front and back. This is a refreshing break from the typical minis displaying the same image on both sides. Additionally, each set is priced fairly reasonably, costing about $5-$10 per set. These minis come beautifully packaged and would make a great gift. I would definitely recommend these paper minis as a low-cost alternative to traditional plastic, metal, or resin minis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minis were provided free for review by Pasiphilo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Maximum Apocalypse</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikegnade/maximum-apocalypse/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Gnade, designer of one Brass Empire, one of my favorite deckbuilders, has just launched a new Kickstarter today for Maximum Apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Maximum Apocalypse, civilization has already fallen. The players are survivors of the apocalypse whose mission is to survive the hostile landscape. The game map is randomly generated and different every time that you play. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to explore the map, play cards, equip weapons, scavenge for resources, draw cards or battle off monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking a unique survivor class within the group, players must plan their strategy and work together while leaning on their survivor’s strengths in order to defeat monsters and avoid starvation. For example, the Fireman is deadly up close with his ax and can easily chop down monsters; meanwhile, the stealthy Hunter is great at scouting the map and avoiding traps — but roaming monsters are gathering quickly and time is running out. If you are overwhelmed by monsters or die of starvation, the players lose. If they can find enough gas and get it back to their van to escape, they all win and live to play another scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about the game already looks top notch, and I’m excited to see it fund and get my hands on a copy. A $40 pledge will make sure you get one for yourself once it goes to print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in finding out more, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikegnade/maximum-apocalypse&quot;&gt;game’s Kickstarter page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spellweaver Single Player Campaign Launched</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spellweaver/spellweaversingle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spellweaver Single Player Campaign&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Spellweaver-Review/&quot;&gt;I really enjoy Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;, a free to play CCG for the PC. The one thing it was really lacking was a single player campaign. That all changed yesterday when Dream Reactor released Spellweaver Chronicles #1: The Holy Child. The campaign brings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15 new cards and 1 new hero&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 main missions and 10 side mission with unique gameplay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thought-provoking Hardcore Mode and tricky Challenges for added replayability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Narrative Events that alter the player’s experience depending on his choices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intriguing story uncovering more of the Spellweaver lore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thematic cosmetic rewards for the completionists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full release information can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://spellweaver-tcg.com/spell_news/single-player-campaign-now-available/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t fired it up yet, but plan to soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign is available now and can be purchased in-game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Slime San</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/slime-san/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slime-San&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://slime-san.com&quot;&gt;Fabraz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.headupgames.com&quot;&gt;Headup Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/473530&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $11.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Steam key for Slime-San just showed up in a press release one day. Sometimes when this happens I either ignore it or install the game and promptly forget about it. Slime-San caught my attention with its interesting graphic design, 2D platforming goodness, and a promise of all sorts of cool extras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slime-San is a 2D platformer aimed at speed runners, similar to games like Super Meat Boy. Each level provides it’s on unique challenges building upon skill you’ve learned in previous levels to proceed. Levels are also timed. Wait too long and the worm’s stomach acid level rises and kills poor Slime-San. Every level requires twitch-reflexes to make your way through them as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention the game takes place inside a giant worm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slime-San has a few abilities to help it make its way through the giant worm. Along with standard abilities like wall jumping, Slime-San can also shift to pass through certain walls. Using this ability also slows down time a bit. On the flip side, there’s also a dash ability. When this power is used time speeds up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very simple game at its core with plenty of extras, like a whole town where you can buy stuff, play mini-games, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slime-San’s has an interesting look with its high-contract pixel graphics. Combine that with a catchy chiptune soundtrack and the game oozes with its own unique charm. Though at times minimal, everything on the screen is very detailed with some really impressive pixel art in town and some level backgrounds. While maybe the visuals may not everyone’s cup of tea, it certainly gets high marks from me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/slime-san/screens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Slime-San Screens&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Minimal and awesome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell everything in Slime-San has been carefully thought out and designed. Levels are clever, challenging, and pure addicting to play through. While the difficulty ramped up pretty quickly I found myself pushing harder, playing longer, and enjoying myself the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slime-San plays tight, looks amazing, sounds great, and is filled with a great sense of humor. The game has 100 levels, tons of secrets, unlockable characters, and some mini-games that are pretty much entire games in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is currently on Steam, with PS4 and Xbox One versions coming out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slime-San is certainly worth your $11.99.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pieces of Game Accessories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for replacement game components or for those of you out there interested in game design, there are a number of 3D printers that can supply your needs.  One of those printers is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/Piecesofgame?ref=condensed_trust_header_title_items&quot;&gt;Pieces of Game&lt;/a&gt;. Tom Headley of Pieces of Game began printing in 2013 on a used Solidoodle 2. Headley, a board game enthusiast, printed game components for friends and to use with his own original game designs. Recently, Headley was kind enough to share some examples with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/piecesofgame/piecesofgame1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pieces of Game 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown here are a few examples of his work. The first is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/234413488/3d-printed-castle-6-towers-6-walls-and-2?ref=shop_home_active_3&quot;&gt;3D-printed castle&lt;/a&gt; for use with &lt;a href=&quot;http://firesidegames.com/games/castle-panic/&quot;&gt;Castle Panic&lt;/a&gt;]. For $13.50, you get six towers, six walls, and two fortifications in the color of your choice. The towers have stairs, an archer’s window, and are curved in the front (making the tower round instead of a hexagon). The walls have small turrets on the ends for added flare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pieces of Game also prints a set of doors, terminals, and crates for Imperial Assault. Searching for ways to spice up my Imperial Assault board is actually how I stumbled upon their shop initially. The set sells for $20 and contains eight crates, eight terminals and eight doors (four open and four closed). It is one of the cheaper 3D token sets on the market, which is a plus if you aren’t looking to splurge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/piecesofgame/piecesofgame2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pieces of Game 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Pieces of Game prints a number of game components such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/234832067/colorful-tent-tokens-4-in-a-set?ref=shop_home_active_21&quot;&gt;tents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/236102832/log-cabin-4-in-a-set?ref=shop_home_active_22&quot;&gt;cabins&lt;/a&gt; shown here. These tokens come in sets of 4 and only cost $2—not bad. If you are looking for cheap game components for that game you have been dreaming up, Pieces of Game is a great source.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Brass Empire</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/brassempire/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Brass Empire&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Mike Gnade &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockmanorgames.com&quot;&gt;Rock Manor Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; Sold Out&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 30-60 Min&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 10+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockmanorgames.com/brass-empire/rules/&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181393/brass-empire&quot;&gt;Brass Empire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brass Empire is a steampunk deckbuilder that I first saw at PAX East last year and then again at the first Connecticut Festival of Indie games. It had a very successful Kickstarter, was available for purchase, and is now sold out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few chances to play the game at the conventions before being lucky enough to get my own copy to play at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brass Empire plays very similarly to other deckbuilders that have a central market. Players will play cards from their hands to provide resources to gather employees, more resources, units, and buildings. This is where Brass Empire starts to set itself apart a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 5 different factions in the game, each with a different starting deck and play style. Employees you hire more employees, buy buildings, or units. They’re your standard deckbuilder resource and are discarded after use. Buildings are permanent and provide bonuses in play. They can also be destroyed. Units are permanent and can attack other units or buildings. They provide the most interaction between players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brass Empire ends when the Brass pool has been emptied, after which the player with the most Brass is the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a better feel for the game, check out the video below. It’s from when the game was still called Steamcraft, but covers everything you need to play the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HprewPxpDXY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brass Empire’s cardstock is in line with any other mass-produced deck builder out there. The plastic cubes have a wonderful feel and a “jelly” look. Really all that’s important there is that they’re easy to handle and differentiate between the two colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Brass Empire really shines is the artwork. It’s has a steampunk feel while remaining colorful and extremely dynamic. In a game that could have been all brass, steam, and grit, there’s plenty of colors, diversity, and culture that shines through without losing the steampunk feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brass Empire is currently one of my favorite deckbuilding games. The combination of theme, artwork, and mechanics really strikes the right chord. The player interaction achieved through the use of units and buildings brings out many different strategies during play and provides the game great deal of replayability as you try each company and various tactics for each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solo play is another great feature in Brass Empire. A Boss card can be setup that acts as an AI player with different victory conditions. Sometimes it’s playing the game as usual. Sometimes it’s defeating the Boss Card in battle. The Steam Knight, a promo card from PAX East, is one such card and provides a difficult, yet rewarding solo experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I stated earlier, Brass Empire is currently out of print. I haven’t heard word of a new printing, but I hope it gets one. It’s a great deckbuilder, and a great game overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing MoonQuake Escape</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been eagerly awaiting a copy of MoonQuake Escape since I first saw the game at PAX East last year. The combination of colorful art, awesome board mechanic, and bluffing had me instantly hooked. At PAX East this year designer Jeff Johnston was able to send me home with a copy, and I was super excited to break it out an put it all togehter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything looks even better than the first prototype I saw and moves smooth as butter. I’ve already gotten in one play of the basic rules and should be getting an advanced play in soon. Review to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the pics!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing King of Tokyo Power Up and Cthulhu Monster Pack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;King of Tokyo is a family favorite. I’ve already &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/King-of-Tokyo-2016-Unboxing/&quot;&gt;taken a look at the new edition of the game&lt;/a&gt;, and now I have the Power Up! expansion and the first Monster Pack, Cthulhu. The Power Up! expansion is pretty much the same as the original, just updated for the new artwork and monsters that come in the base game. Cthulhu is the first of what I hope are many monster packs, containing not only the monster, but everything needed to use it with the base game and Power Up! expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s get to the pics!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - 3D Printworks Dice Tower and Vault</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of us that don’t want to shell out the big bucks for a 3D printer, there are some quality “go-between” printing operations out there. One of those is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/3dPrintworksShop#about&quot;&gt;3D Printworks&lt;/a&gt;. Owned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/people/barbarathorndyke1&quot;&gt;Barbara Thorndyke&lt;/a&gt; and based out of Springfield, Missouri, 3D Printworks offers a number of gaming items. Thorndyke’s operation is characterized by an approachable small-town flavor with a specialty in attention to detail. This small, two-printer operation works with freelance designers or pulls designs from Thingiverse. This means that 3D Printworks offers a collection of both unique and common market items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D Printwork was kind enough to share two examples of their work with me: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/476787874/3d-printed-dice-tower-easy-travel-size?ref=shop_home_active_11&quot;&gt;Travel-Size Dice Tower&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/491595089/3d-printed-magnetic-dice-vault-more?ref=shop_home_active_7&quot;&gt;Magnetic Dice Vault&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3DPrintworks/tower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compact dice tower can handle 12mm and 16mm dice with ease. Standard D20’s and your typical RPG set of seven dice will also roll through nicely. The bottom tray traps the dice well, so they don’t go tumbling away off the table after they pass the tower’s two slanted ledges. The dice tower is printed from PLA (polylactic acid), a biodegradable plastic made from plant starches. Its dimensions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Height: 105.4mm, 4.15 inches
Width: 48.2mm, 1.9 inches
Funnel Width: 63.3mm, 2.49 inches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the source file for this dice tower &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1358428&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3DPrintworks/vault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dice Vault&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dice vault uses Neodymium magnets to hold itself shut, keeping your dice secure during your travels. It can hold a standard set of seven dice, plus an additional extra. Its dimensions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Height - 0.95 inches, 24.2mm
Width - 1.31 inches, 33.3mm
Length - 5.94 inches, 150.8mm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both prints sell for $20 each and have sixteen different color options to choose from. Orders typically take 1-2 business days, making this a relatively speedy print operation. If you are looking for low-cost, quick prints, 3D Printworks is a great source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;Rising Star Games&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/88-heroes/cid=UP4034-CUSA05807_00-88HEROES00000000&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;88 heroes xbox&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $14.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK. I normally don’t do this, but it’s just too perfect of an introduction to a game to not. From 88 Heroes store page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s 8:08am on 8th August 1988, and the evil Dr. H8 has brought the world to the brink of total annihilation! His demands are simple: pay $88 octillion within 88 minutes, or Dr. H8’s 88 thermo-nuclear warheads will wipe out the Earth! But who will save us in our time of need? The bravest? The boldest? No… the 88 Heroes!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;88 Heroes is a puzzle platformer where you need to navigate your hero through Dr. H8’s tower floor-by-floor. Each floor as an elevator you need to reach and plenty of challenges and obstacles to keep you from getting there. You’ve also only have 88 seconds to beat each level, and 88 minutes to beat the game. You’ve also only got 88 lives in the form of 88 different heroes. If they all die it’s game over, man. Game over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may think 88 heroes is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than you’d need to beat the game. The problem is that each and every hero is pretty useless. Some have crazy powers. Some have pointless powers. Some have no powers at all. Even worse, some have powers that will pretty much kill the hero as soon as they’re used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be discouraged, though! Earn enough coins and you can resurrect dead heroes! Hopefully, ones that are more useful than most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;88 Heroes certainly has it’s own quirky pixel art. It’s all very goofy, over the top with the 88s, and has a soundtrack that’s good, but not ultra memorable. One of the coolest things about how the game presents itself is the perspective from which you play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/88heroes/88_heroes_18.png&quot; alt=&quot;88 Heroes Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;An interesting perspective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the game, you’re playing the game over the shoulder of Dr. H8 as he watches the heroes make their way through his tower. He’ll provide commentary when you die/complete a level and you’ll also see his minions scuttling about as you try and concentrate on the level you’re trying to complete. It’s pretty unique, and just another wonderful bit of quirkiness 88 Heroes provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to lie, I laugh my ass off while playing 88 Heroes. It’s over the top in almost every way and the heroes are so ridiculous it’s hard not to laugh, win or die. The game is challenging, but not so hard that you’re going to throw your controller in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already mentioned the excellent pixel art. I’ve also mentioned the mostly forgettable soundtrack. What I haven’t yet mentioned is the excellent voice work and sound effects in the game. I also haven’t said much about the controls, which range from excellent to almost impossible depending on the hero you’re playing as. It’s a crap shoot, though I have so much fun playing the game that the truly terrible heroes are just a blip on my radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For $15 you can’t go wrong with 88 Heroes. It’s a solid platformer with an excellent gimmick. I only wish I had the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/88-Heroes-Gets-Physical-Release/&quot;&gt;physical release&lt;/a&gt; for the PS4 that gives you two additional heroes to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Micro Review - SlowQuest: The Goblin Guard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/slowquest.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SlowQuest: The Goblin Guard&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Bodie Hartley is an illustrator and author of SlowQuest, fantasy zines that he creates himself and sells on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/SlowQuest?ref=l2-shopheader-name&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t even remember how I came across his shop, or how I first found out about SlowQuest, but I was immediately intrigued by the idea of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first book, in what Brodie hopes will be a series of books, is called The Goblin Guard. It’s a 35-page pick-your-path mini-adventure where you’re an adventurer searching for treasure in a dungeon. The only interaction here is an angry, little goblin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first SlowQuest book is short, even going back and choosing all the available paths. It’s also a fairly simple read. There’s not a lot of text as the zine’s dimensions are pretty small. This by no means diminishes what The Goblin Guard is, a beautiful hand-made product with a ton of charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/slowquest/thegoblinguard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Goblin Guard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it worth the $5.51 it costs? That all depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re looking for an in-depth choose-your-own-adventure style book then this isn’t the product for you. If you like cool hand-made things and are looking for little humorous adventure with some cute illustrations then this would be a wonderful little zine to keep on your desk at work or on a coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to more SlowQuest from Bodie, especially a longer adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - CraftLessTraveled Custom Tokens</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I connected with Rebecca from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/CraftLessTraveled&quot;&gt;CraftLessTraveled&lt;/a&gt;. Based out of Greensboro, North Carolina, CraftLessTraveled makes a number of custom game tokens. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/CraftLessTraveled&quot;&gt;online shop&lt;/a&gt;, they offer a variety of tokens for the board game &lt;a href=&quot;http://megacongames.com/games/myth/&quot;&gt;Myth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing/&quot;&gt;Fantasy Flight’s X-Wing&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, CraftLessTraveled creates custom tokens for local gamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CraftLessTraveled kindly provided me with a handful of these awesome tokens for review. Shown here are sets of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/484722335/myth-potion-tokens?ref=shop_home_active_1&quot;&gt;Myth Potion Tokens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/476913828/myth-treasure-coins?ref=shop_home_active_5&quot;&gt;Myth Treasure Coins&lt;/a&gt;, and a sampling of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/484057293/wound-tokens?ref=shop_home_active_4&quot;&gt;Wound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/484058423/health-tokens?ref=shop_home_active_3&quot;&gt;Health Tokens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/craftlesstraveled/tokens1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tokens 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each set of Myth Treasure Coins is made to order and features 54 tokens to replace all of the treasure bag coins from the Myth core box and the new Journeyman expansion. The set breaks down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30 White Coins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15 Green Coins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 Blue Coins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Gold/Yellow Coins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Orange Coin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CraftLessTraveled explains that as with any well-used tokens, the original cardboard game tokens in your game box often wear out. These reproductions eliminate that problem, allowing for years of use without any degradation of the tokens. Each token features the same artwork as the original token crafted into a unique button with a flat back. This not only gives the tokens a glossy look, but also protects them from wear. These token replacements provide a satisfying metallic clink to your treasure bag without adding a lot of weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/craftlesstraveled/tokens2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tokens 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find cool is that the Potion, Wound and Health Tokens are compatible with many games (like Super Dungeon Explore, etc.). But, what is really cool is that if you have a specific custom token request, you can go ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/people/depier17&quot;&gt;shoot CraftLessTraveled a message&lt;/a&gt;. These token sets cost between $7 and $30 depending on the specific set. They are certainly an affordable way to upgrade your games and get away from the standard cardboard original tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tokens provided free for review by CraftLessTraveled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PAX East 2017 - EarthNight</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed//UvTP49XMQNc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made sure I made an appointment at PAX East with Cleversoft as soon as I received their press released for EarthNight, an endless runner…that has an end. The hand-painted artwork was an instant draw for me and I eagerly awaited my time slot to sit down and have a chance to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I saw in that tiny booth tucked against the outer wall of the convention floor was the best game of the show. I played a PS4 build of the game with both of its main characters, Stanley, a freelance photographer with a sword and awesome beard, and Sydney, a 14-year-old high schooler with some kind of awesome power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, mankind has been all but wiped out by the Dragon Apocalypse. What remains of humanity lives in space. Stanley and Sydney free fall from their tiny space station and plummet towards earth, running along the backs of gigantic dragons and killing them as they go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each character plays a bit differently. Stanley is more for beginners as he’s pretty straight forward to control and has a sword that can slice through smaller enemies. Sydney is a bit harder, but a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more rewarding. She can double jump, dash, and power slam and she races along dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EarthNight is very close to console release on the PS4, with iOS, Android, PS Vita, Mac, and PC versions coming shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is certainly one to wait for, and drool over.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Kentucky Sawdust Dice Trays</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thomas Elmore of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KentuckySawdustProducts/&quot;&gt;Kentucky Sawdust&lt;/a&gt; was generous enough to send over two woodwork dice trays for review. Kentucky Sawdust, based out of Louisville, Kentucky, crafts a number of custom wood gaming products and has been selling them in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/KentuckySawdust?ref=search_shop_redirect&quot;&gt;online shop&lt;/a&gt; since 2015. Shown below are two of their Premium Dice Trays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dice tray displayed is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/479710541/premium-dice-tray-personal-sized-walnut?ref=shop_home_active_26&quot;&gt;personal sized dice tray made of walnut wood&lt;/a&gt; featuring a red felt rolling surface. Both dice trays shown are built of sturdy solid-wood construction. Specifically, the personal dice tray was designed to help conserve table space. This is great considering the large amounts of cards, tokens, and tiles that modern tabletop games have. This tray costs about $25–30, depending on the wood type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kentuckysawdust/tray1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tray 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second dice tray shown is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/498584578/premium-dice-tray-table-top-sized-purple?ref=shop_home_active_24&quot;&gt;tabletop-sized dice tray made of purple heart wood&lt;/a&gt; featuring a grey felt rolling surface. The tabletop-sized tray is a larger tray that is more easily reached by everyone at the table and sells for approximately $50–55, depending on the wood type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kentuckysawdust/tray2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tray 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each tray is a hand-made unique product, differing in grain and varying slightly in color. Each tray is comprised of natural wood finished in mineral and protective wax. There are a number of wood varieties to select from: walnut, wenge, red oak, padauk, zebrawood, lacewood, and purple heart. Additionally, Kentucky Sawdust offers six different colors for the felt rolling surface: red, grey, blue, brown, tan, and purple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kentuckysawdust/tray3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tray 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect these beautiful trays, they are packaged professionally in protective wrap. These are made to order, which means that each tray takes a week or two to ship. However, they are well worth the wait. These trays are a clear testament to quality and craftsmanship and I would recommend these trays to anyone looking to spruce up their game table or give as a gift to family or friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dice trays were provided free for review from Kentucky Sawdust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Blossom Tales</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blossomtales/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blossom Tales&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://castlepixel.com/blossomtales/&quot;&gt;Castle Pixel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fdg-entertainment.com&quot;&gt;FDG Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/446810/&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t that long ago that I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Blossom-Tales-Coming-March-28/&quot;&gt;posted about&lt;/a&gt; the upcoming release of Blossom Tales, an action-RPG in the vein of A Link to the Past. Since then I had first downloaded the demo, then received a key for a pre-release copy of the game. Since then I’ve been playing the game quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game, admittedly, as a bit of the Princess Bride in it as well as Zelda. The tale is told by a grandfather to his two grandkids. This provides an interesting, if underused, mechanic to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blossomtales/grandpa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Grandpa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blossomtales/arrows.png&quot; alt=&quot;Arrows&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;If you’re familiar with Zelda: A Link to the Past, or top-down action-RPGs in general, then you know what to expect from Blossom Tales. Players take control of Lily, Knight of the Rose, trying to save her king and kingdom from a dark wizard. Throughout the game, certain narrative choices can be made through the children having their Grandpa change the story. These changes, though minor, provide an interesting twist to gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cool thing to note is that while similar actions-RPGs limit items such as arrows and bombs, Blossom Knight does not. These items can be used as much as you like until your special meter runs out. Once it does it refills rather quickly. This keeps the pace of the game moving much faster as you can solve puzzles and overcome some challenges a bit faster instead of hunting down items to replenish your stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Blossom Knight has its own artistic direction it still borrows heavily from the look and feel of A Link to the Past. Everything from the bombs, pots and even the walls look like they could have been pulled from the SNES classic. This isn’t a bad thing at all, mind you. It’s all very intentional and well executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blossomtales/blacksmith.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blacksmith&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a lot of fun with Blossom Tales. It’s well made, polished, and accomplishes what it sets out to so. Gameplay is smooth, familiar, and satisfying, with an excellent soundtrack to go along with excellent gameplay. It’s a game I highly recommend to anyone who grew up in the golden age of action-RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have a few gripes, however. The first being the underutilization of the children being told the story by their grandpa. At times players will need to make choices in the way of the children telling their grandpa they want certain details of the story changed. These changes are minor and really don’t have much of an effect on the game as a whole. I feel like this mechanic could have been put to some use with larger changes in the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second gripe is about the length of the game. While 15+ hours is nothing to scoff at, you get 5 dungeons and then you’re done. I feel like the game could have used a bit more content, similar to how Link to the Past tossed you into the Dark Realm once you beat Aghanim. It was a cool twist to the game, and Blossom Tales could have used something like that to really suck the players in a bit more and provide a bit more game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t really major concerns, though, and they’re by no means a reason to skip the game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blossom Tales comes out in a few days, and it’s one you certainly should snag and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://supermegateam.com/our-games/rise-shine/&quot;&gt;Super Awesome Hyper Dimensional Mega Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adultswim.com/games/&quot;&gt;Adult Swim Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/347290&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/rise-shine/br3152pvjv5j&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $14.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamearth is the world where classic video game characters live. It’s also the world that Space Grunts from Nexgen planet are currently invading for no reason other than they’re big and have giant guns and like to use them. Rise, and his gun Shine, are the only ones who can stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they’ll die, repeatedly, in the process. They’ll also have to repeat large swathes of the game, because the save system sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Run and Gun” is the closest I can get to explaining the core of Rise &amp;amp; Shine. It’s a 2D game where you’re running, aiming, and shooting everything in sight. There’s also bullet-hell and cover-based shooter mechanics in there, as well as some puzzle elements. Toss in a little bit of platforming and you’ve got Rise &amp;amp; Shine. It’s a fresh formula that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; works. More about that in the Perspective section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game starts you off as a fairly helpless child named Rise and tosses you right into the action. In fact, you’ll probably die before you even know what’s going on. Dash to the first point of cover and you’ll be presented with a bit of story that puts Shine into your hands. Shine is an intelligent gun with the firepower of a cannon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run, cover, shoot. That’s the basics. Throughout the game, Shine will get some upgrades that will help you solve puzzles along the way, but that core “blow everything up” vibe still prevails in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rise &amp;amp; Shine is an absolutely stunning looking game. Everything in the game is hand-painted and layered in a meticulous fashion. Moving through the game feels fluid and whole, and every step you take feels fresh, new, and exciting. A visual treat for the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music, composed by Damián Sánchez, is fully orchestrated and wonderful, though at times it’s hard to hear over the sounds of explosions and your repeated deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXYQ4iunOSo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love the way the game looks, Rise &amp;amp; Shine is &lt;em&gt;brutally&lt;/em&gt; hard. Not just hard in a Dark Souls kind of way, either. It’s almost as if the game takes every cheap shot it can at you. Combine that with controls that just aren’t up to snuff and it’s enough that it really put a damper on my enjoyment of the game. Enough that I put the game down and probably won’t pick it up ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame, really. Rise &amp;amp; Shine really has a lot going for it, but the difficulty and poor controls are things I can’t get past. It’s rage inducing, and I just don’t need that kind of stress in a video game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Steam copy of Rise &amp;amp; Shine was provided free for review by Adult Swim Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PAX East 2017 - Kingdom: New Lands</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kingdom/banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kingdom: New Lands&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rawfury.com&quot;&gt;Raw Fury&lt;/a&gt; had a lot going on in their booth during PAX East. Sadly I didn’t have much time to look around and see everything that was going on there. I did, however, follow up with them after the show to see what was going on and what they had to offer. While they have a bunch of awesome looking new games, the one that really caught my eye was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kingdomthegame.com&quot;&gt;Kingdom: New Lands&lt;/a&gt; from Noio and Licorice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that I love pixel art. I think I’ve made it pretty clear here that anything with beautiful pixels is immediately on my radar. Kingdom: New Lands is no exception. New Lands is actually a follow up to Kingdom that adds a slew of new content for players to discover. The game is sort of an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; minimal city management game. The game doesn’t hold your hand in any way, shape, or form and players need to learn by experience what to do, and how to make your city prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve barely scratched the surface of what content New Lands has to offer. So far I’m managed to build a small city that can somewhat defend itself against these creepy things that come at night and try to steal my gold and crown. I’m guessing things get much tougher as you go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kingdom: New Lands is available on just about every platform except my toaster. Here’s the complete list:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PAX East 2017 - Lost Castle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lostcastle/header.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lost Castle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon Hunter Studios’ booth while working my way to one of my various appointments at PAX East this year. I had almost walked right by them when a game on one of their 2 screens caught my eye. That game was &lt;a href=&quot;http://anotherindie.com/game/lost-castle/&quot;&gt;Lost Castle&lt;/a&gt;. I was immediately struck by how much it resembled Castle Crashers, a game I have fond memories of playing online with friends. After talking to one of the developers I found out the game is like a cross between Castle Crashers and a Rogue Legacy. Death is permanent, though you can earn souls that allow you to make upgrades to future characters to make play easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lost Castle also caters a bit more to the hardcore gamer. It’s difficult and you’re expected to die, and to die often. Underneath its cute veneer, it’s brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been significantly impressed I walked away from the booth with a Steam key in hand and a strong desire to get home and install the game (which I did.) I’ve gotten some play in, but not enough to write up my full review yet. So far I’m really enjoying it, though I have to admit to rage-quitting more than a few times so far while trying to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to take my word for it before I write up the review? &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/434650/&quot;&gt;Snag the game&lt;/a&gt; on Steam now for $9.99.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Street Fighter V Offers Sneak Peek and Free Week to PC Players</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning on March 28th at 1pm PST / 9pm GMT and running to April 3rd at 12pm PST / 8pm GMT, current and new Street Fighter V players will be able to experience the improved CFN system and test out the new Season 2 balance adjustments for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This offer will only be good for Steam players and only for online play, but will be completely free to play for both current and new players. Every character, including Kolin, will be unlocked for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the test is concluded, Capcom will make further adjustments to optimize the new CFN and it will make its official release to both PS4 and PC players soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of improvements and new features coming to the new CFN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matchmaking Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most players, it will take less time to find an opponent in online matches. Matchmaking logic will help players avoid being frequently matched with the same opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranked and Casual Match Loading Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a shorter transition when going into a Ranked or Casual match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the new CFN home menu, a live feed of Friends’ activities will be presented on an interactive Timeline. Using the Timeline, players can immediately add a recent match to their Replay List, view a Fighter Profile, manage Friends, and adjust Timeline display settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friend Management System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to adding someone to Favorites, players can now blacklist players or add friends and follow them on CFN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Rage Quit” Penalty System&lt;/strong&gt;
Special “rage quit” player profile icons will appear on profiles with frequent disconnections. Matchmaking logic will take into account online behavior and frequent disconnectors will be matched with similar opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training Mode – User Settings Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training Mode settings will be saved and will carry over to the next time the mode is accessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle Lounge Country Flags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country flags will appear in Battle Lounges, allowing players to locate competition in their region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country / League Based Rankings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players will be able to filter leaderboards based on Country or League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-Game Announcer Voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-game announcer will provide players and opponents with stats using data pulled from the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighter Profile Stats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More detailed stats will be tracked and presented on Fighter Profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Dungeon Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dungeontime/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dunegon Time&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Carlo A. Rossi &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aresgames.eu/tag/dungeon-time&quot;&gt;Ares Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mS3dRJ&quot;&gt;$30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 10-60 Min&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 8+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aresgames.eu/wp/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2016/06/ARCG002-DungeonTime-Rulebook-KS-EN-web.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/192401/dungeon-time&quot;&gt;Dungeon Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June of last year, Ares Games had a successful Kickstarter campaign for Dungeon Time with a final funding of 650% of their initial goal. The final shipments of the game went out in February of this year and I was lucky enough to have Ares shoot me a copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Time is a real-time, cooperative game of gathering treasure without breaking your backpack. The game can be played solo or with up to 5 players in one-off games or a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dungeontime/banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dungeon Time&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the backpack is placed in the middle of all the players and the reward tokens are put off to the side. Then the mission deck is put together based off the scenario the players are going to attempt and shuffled. Take 2 and set them aside. Then the item cards are shuffled. Draw off the number of item cards for the number of players (noted in the rules), shuffle them with the 2 mission cards that were set aside, and deal the cards out to each player. Now the remaining item deck and mission cards are shuffled together to create a draw pile. Once everyone is ready, the sand timer is flipped and the 5 minute game of Dungeon Time is on its way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Time is played in two phases: the Story Phase and the Resolution Phase. The Story Phase is the meat of the game and is the portion played in real time. Here players will play items from their hands to try and complete missions. Cards are played face up to the center of the backpack. If a player thinks the right items are in the story deck to complete a mission they can place a mission card onto the deck. Play is simultaneous and players always draw back up to the hand limit after cards are played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once time is up the game moves into the Resolution Phase. The Story pile is flipped over and cards are played one by one around the backpack. Items of the same type can stack up to 3 times. If a mission card comes up and the appropriate items are on the board then the mission is completed, the items discarded, and the reward tile is placed around the backpack following the same stacking rules. This continues until one of the following happens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The goal amount of missions has been completed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The backpack runs out of space for items to be placed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A stack of more than 3 items is created&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Story pile runs out of cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players lose the game if anything happens other than the goal amount of missions are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also Hero Cards, Adventure Cards, and Scrolls that can be incorporated into the game for more of a thematic feel. These can help players, provide more challenging play, and generally expand the game past the basic gameplay. For info on these, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aresgames.eu/wp/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2016/06/ARCG002-DungeonTime-Rulebook-KS-EN-web.pdf&quot;&gt;full rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Time contains mostly cards, but also cardboard reward tiles and a small board. Everything is what you’d expect from a publisher such as Ares. Cards are sturdy stock and the reward tiles and board are a thick cardboard. The box the game comes in contains an insert where everything fits into nicely without wasting a lot of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a filler Dungeon Time provides a lot of fun in a very quick package when playing with the basic rules and a one-shot scenario. As a longer game playing the campaign, with Heroes, and/or Adventure Cards, the game evolves into something a bit larger and more in-depth. You can easily play the campaign over the course of a couple of gaming sessions and alter the way you play by adding in the extras and playing the bonus scenarios. Combine that with a solid solo experience and playing the game over with only 7 backpack slots and you’ve got a lot of game in a $30 package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dungeontime/heroes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heroes&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;I first played Dungeon Time with my 7-year-old and we failed the starter scenario horribly. We took another crack at it and were successful on our second go, giving us the confidence we needed to move on to bigger and better things. We found that adding in Heroes is a great way to ease into things before starting the main campaign or even attempting using Adventure Cards. We’re now at the point where we’re enjoying the challenge and not getting trashed about every time we play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest tip I can give you when playing? &lt;em&gt;Talk&lt;/em&gt; to each other. Make sure that every moment of your five minutes has every player knowing who has what cards and what can be played. It’s very important to make sure you’re completing missions as efficiently as possible, taking into consideration what rewards each completed mission gives you. Even a small slip-up can break your backpack and lose you the game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Time provides and amazing experience with many different layers. It’s challenging, entertaining, and a lot of fun to play with the kids. As I stated before, it’s well worth the $30 investment for what you get.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Thinkgeek's New Bag of Holding</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/bagofholding.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot; alt=&quot;Bag of Holding&quot; /&gt;
It wasn’t long ago that I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/ThinkGeek-New-Bag-of-Holding/&quot;&gt;posted about&lt;/a&gt; the release of ThinkGeek’s new Bag of Holding. The other weekend at PAX East I met with ThinkGeek to see what else they had coming out soon and they were kind of enough to send me home with one of the new bags to help me carry all my con swag home. I was a bit more than excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I’m traveling with my family for the National OAKE Conference in Philly. A perfect chance to see what the new Bag of Holding can do. Just before we left I packed it up with my 15” Macbook Pro with its charger, my pocket Moleskine and some writing utensils, various charging cables, and a few board games. The smaller games I packed inside were Mint Works, Innovation, Scuttle, and Miskatonic School for Boys. Those fit easily in the smaller compartment with my MacBook’s power cord. I also packed a larger game. &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209166/meduris-der-ruf-der-gotter&quot;&gt;Meduris&lt;/a&gt; to be exact. It’s a fairly standard sized, square box. Probably 12”x12”x2”. It fit with absolutely &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; issues in the larger compartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a feat the older Bag of Holding would have had a bit of a problem with. The new Bag of Holding is slightly larger and has a square profile rather than a more rectangular one like its predecessors. Not only did Meduris fit with no issue, but the bag as a whole wasn’t overly bulking when I closed it up with all my travel goodies. Also, the new should padding made it much more comfortable to carry with a bit of weight in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size isn’t the only feature of the Bag of Holding that got an upgrade. The bottom corners of the bag are now reinforced with leather. A welcome nicety since my last bag has several holes down there from wear and tear. The zippers are a bit more rugged with stronger keys. The bag zips up nicely with a satisfying feeling. The clasps for the front flap and back pocket have been replaced with magnetic closures, each of which stays secure when you’re toting the bag around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s soem visual upgrades, too. The d20 and Bag of Holding logo on the front of the bag are now pressed into leather, while the lining of the bag’s inside now have a geeky print containing swords, shields, gemstones, potions, and d20s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty safe to say I love this bag. I mean, I loved the old Bag of Holding, but the new one fixes some of the gripes I had with my aging satchel. Will I throw out my beat up, old Bag of Holding? Never. I’ll fix it up the best I can and will continue to treasure it. Will I replace it with this new version for my everyday carry? &lt;em&gt;Hell, yes&lt;/em&gt;. The new Bag of Holding is everything I look for in a bag and feels like it’s built to last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want one? You should. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/aaa5/?itm=290438454228_product_type_accessories_product_type_backpacks_%26_messenger_bags&amp;amp;rkgid=3189411456&amp;amp;cpg=ogpla&amp;amp;source=google_none&amp;amp;adpos=1o1&amp;amp;creative=185033526455&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;matchtype=&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwwcjGBRDj-P7TwcinyBkSJADymblTK6-w85sDduhYj9aDS8ojIrWVcicsSj4YC9b-CiU3URoCnUzw_wcB&quot;&gt;snag one&lt;/a&gt; over a ThinkGeek for $49.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Bag of Holding was provided for free by ThinkGeek for review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Eldritch Arts Dice Boxes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/EldritchArtsUS?ref=l2-shopheader-name&quot;&gt;Eldritch Arts&lt;/a&gt; sent me three of their more popular dice boxes to check out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/468786243/deep-one-rpg-dice-box-jatoba-brazilian?ref=shop_home_feat_2&quot;&gt;Deep One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/455301526/elemental-flame-rpg-dice-box-jatoba?ref=shop_home_feat_3&quot;&gt;Elemental Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/460812228/elven-tree-rpg-dice-box-jatoba-brazilian?ref=shop_home_feat_1&quot;&gt;Elven Tree&lt;/a&gt;. Eldritch Arts is based out of Stanwood, Washington. They produce a number of beautiful laser-cut Jatoba (Brazilian Cherry) dice boxes that they sell on Etsy.com. Jatoba is a strong, wear-resistant, reddish-colored wood (twice the hardness of oak). This makes for a sturdy case to guard and display your dice set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eldritcharts/ea1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eldrtich Arts Dice Boxes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detail on these dice boxes is excellent and Eldritch Arts offers about 20 different designs to choose from. Each box has a unique relief image laser-cut into the lid. The lid is held tight to the base of the box by two magnets ensuring that your dice don’t fall out. Each box measures roughly 6”L x 1.25” W x 1”H and holds a full standard set of gaming dice. Additionally, they are felt lined to safely protect your dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eldritcharts/ea2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eldrtich Arts Dice Boxes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to find any real “flaws” in these boxes. They are made in the good old U.S.A. and even smell like freshly cut wood. They sell for $22 each, not bad for laser-cut wooden gaming products on the market these days. If you are regularly rolling dice or looking for a good gift for a friend, this is certainly a great option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Dice Boxes were provided for review by Eldritch Arts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PAX East 2017 - Divinity: Original Sin 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divinity/DOS2_KeyArt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divinity: Original Sin 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larian Studios had an impressive showing at PAX East with plenty of workstations loaded with an early access copy of Divinity: Original Sin 2. Set a thousand years after the first game, Divinity: Original Sin 2 features a darker and more grounded narrative than its award-winning predecessor, while building on its lauded combat systems. Just the first chapter of the new game contains more narrative text than the entire of its predecessor. Also, just about everything in the world can be interacted with, every NPC can be talked to, and there’s different, branching options available for every character type. Each of your actions will have an impact on the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a chance to play a bit of the game and was impressed at what I saw so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now Act 1 of the game is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/&quot;&gt;Steam Early Access Release&lt;/a&gt;. That gets you around 8-12 hours of gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more info, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.divinity.game&quot;&gt;game’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geniusgames/cytosis-a-cell-biology-board-game/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d only recently found out about Cytosis, a game that may have slipped by my radar if it weren’t for a PR company I deal with on a normal basis. I was offered a prototype to take a look at and figured the game looked pretty sweet, if for nothing else other than the fact that it was science based and had a cool looking board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game arrived in 2 parts: an envelope with all the bits and a rolled up board printed on poster paper. After a few days of getting the board to sit flat, I sat down with my 7-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter to play. Upon reading the rules I was a bit surprised to what I was actually getting into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, Cytosis is a worker placement game. Players have a number of workers depending on the number of players in the game. Each turn they can place these to gather several types of resources, energy, convert resources to other resources, gain the first player card and claim a goal, buy component cards, or synthesize hormones, proteins, or enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cytosis is made up of several other different cool mechanics that come together to make a whole.  After every round, an Event card is played that effect the games. The game is over when the Event deck runs out. There are goal cards players can claim that will earn them bonus points at the end of the game if the conditions are met. There’s also different ways to score points during the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormones and Proteins can be created over the course of several turns by moving them along different worker tracks. These are generally worth more points as they require time and resources to complete. Hormone and Protein Receptions work similarly, but also score extra points when you or another player score a Hormone or Protein. Enzymes are easier to score on as they just require 1 worker placement, limited resources, and a small expenditure of energy. They’re not worth much, but can be very useful when in sets. There’s also detox cards which are the easiest to score on, are worth the least, but earn big bonus points to the player who has completed the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Event deck runs out scores are calculated and the player with the highest score wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that Cytosis comes with a Virus expansion that adds a bit more depth to gameplay by having players building up antibodies to survive virus attacks. So far we haven’t given that aspect of the game a shot yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a prototype there’s not much I can go on here except the art direction. Cytosis is certainly colorful and very pleasing to the eye. The board is both beautiful and functional, as are the cards. The prototype I have is very well put together overall, and I can’t wait to see what the finished game will look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit blown away by Cytosis, mostly because I was kind of expecting something completely different that the game I played. Cytosis is more than just a worker placement game. It’s an &lt;em&gt;extremely good&lt;/em&gt; worker placement game. Between the different ways to score during the game, the goal mechanic, and the event deck, there’s plenty of paths to victory. The board has just enough worker spaces to make sure there’s always options but holds back just enough so that strategic areas can be blocked off my cunning players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What surprised me the most about Cytosis is how accessible the game is. Not only was I able to teach my 7-year-old son to play, but he was able to hold his own and almost pull out a victory in our first game. His defining moment was claiming the “First Player” space even though he already had the card, just so the rest of us playing couldn’t take that advantage away from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cytosis has already blown through its funding goal with 24 days left as of this writing. A $39 pledge will get you the game and its expansion, and let me tell you, that’s a deal. The game is excellent and will probably be my go-to for worker placements games for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype of Cytosis: A Cell Biology Game was provided free for this preview by Genius Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Barbarians: The Invasion Kickstarter Coming Soon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barbarians/barbarians.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barbarians&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tabula.games/&quot;&gt;Tabula Games&lt;/a&gt; has announced their latest upcoming Kickstarter project—&lt;a href=&quot;https://tabula.games/extras/barbarians-the-invasion/&quot;&gt;Barbarians: The Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. Barbarians is the brainchild of Pierluca Zizzi, author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-HYB01USASM-Hyperborea-Board-Game/dp/B00KN0LSTE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1489846970&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=hyperborea+board+game&quot;&gt;Hyperborea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Your-Game-Signorie/dp/B016U7K0L0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1489847005&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=signorie+board+game&quot;&gt;Signorie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Your-Game-WYG0001-Boardgame/dp/B009XBADOA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1489847114&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=asgard+board+game&quot;&gt;Asgard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Passport-Game-Studios-NSK011-Simurgh/dp/B01FHNPVSK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1489847140&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Simurgh+board+game&quot;&gt;Simurgh&lt;/a&gt;. Set in the mysterious world of Fenian, Barbarians is a Eurogame similar in origination as its predecessors—players jockey for control of a strategic map by conquering territories and gaining resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Barbarians is not the same old tired Eurogame that we have seen crowding shelves lately. Barbarians promises to feature the stunning artwork of Ivan Cavini, detailed miniatures, and a unique turning wheel mechanic for worker placement. The turning wheel allows players to change available paths and strategies while building cities, towns and campsites, allowing them to grow stronger and obtain resources. Players will be able to summon gods, spirits of glorious Warchiefs of the past, and bend their will to demons to obtain favors. By conquering lands from civilized nations and battling them, players fight to gain control of the most land, instead of against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barbarians/model.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barbarians&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barbarians/prototype.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barbarians&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barbarians/design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Barbarians&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zizzi explains that in Barbarians, the greatest Warchief won’t be the one focused solely on war, but the one able to manage all aspects of growing and leading a clan. And, although Tabula Games appears to be keeping many of the game details close to its chest, from the concept art, miniature sculpts, and game-test photos, Barbarians seems like it will be worth the wait. Zizzi and Tabula Games have a great track record of producing fun games. I will be looking forward to the announcement of the Kickstarter kick-off and getting my hands on a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Dog Might Adventure Case</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dogmight/logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dog Might Logo&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;A few weeks ago &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dogmight.com/about&quot;&gt;Dog Might&lt;/a&gt; shot me over one of their amazing-looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dogmight.com/adventurecase&quot;&gt;Adventure Cases&lt;/a&gt; over to take a look at. These cases are ultra-customizable and meant to provide an elegant, and functional, storage solution for tabletop gamers. Ease case is is custom made for each customer, who can choose from multiple kinds of wood, felt/suede linings, cover designs, and even accessories like interior lights or metal emblems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case I received is a beautiful dark wood, with black felt and a crouching dragon on the lid. Let’s get to the pictures before we get to the actual review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dogmight/ac1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Case&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dogmight/ac2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Case&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dogmight/ac3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Case&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dogmight/ac4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Case&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dogmight/ac5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Case&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the case is pretty amazing, with plenty of space to store dice, cards, writing utensils, and just about anything else a player might need for a day. The main compartment can even be used as a dice tray and the lid can be propped up to keep die rolls secret for a GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now my Adventure Case is holding my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/SkullSplitter-Dice-Review/&quot;&gt;SkullSplitter Dice&lt;/a&gt;, favorite pen and pencil, pocket Moleskine, and a small book light (I didn’t get an Adventure Case with the light accessory.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I like it? It’s pretty great. The box is sturdy with heavy metal hinges and latches. The corners have metal coverings to help keep the box protected against accidental bumps and scrapes. The latch that keeps the interior doors shut is snug and leaves no wiggle room, meaning whatever smaller bits you may store up there should stay in their respective compartments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only real, minor, gripe is that there are no real “feet” to the box. The metal corners on the bottom have a few studs to help prevent scratching whatever surface the box may be on, but they’re not quite enough. Rubber/felt feet could easily be added, but would detract from the look of the box a bit. I’m still on the prowl for better solutions.  I actually just scratched my dining room table with the box while writing this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the Adventure Case is a wonderful product with a lot of options for gamers to choose from. It’s always nice to have a custom gaming accessory to liven up any game room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adventure Cases aren’t cheap, but they’re also not as expensive as other wooden accessories out there. You’re looking at something between $130-$200 before accessories. It’s an investment that I feel is worth it for the avid gamer, especially RPG players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Adventure Case was provided free for review by Dog Might.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/203326/war-co-expandable-card-game&quot;&gt;War Co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had completely missed out on Pangea Games Company’s Kickstarter for War Co. last year. Had I seen it, I probably would have backed it based on the card art alone. Unfortunately I did miss it, but learned about the game through the designer’s Twitter account. After a brief exchange he agreed to send me all 6 decks to take a look at. Being fans of card-battle games, my son and I set out to see what this game of futuristic war was all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of War Co. is simple, be the last one standing. How do you do this? By being the only one with cards left in their deck. In War Co., your cards are your health. When they’re gone, you’re gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup is easy. Each player shuffles their deck and places it in front of them. If you’re playing with more than 2 players every player must discard 5 cards for every additional player involved in the game. Then everyone takes 10 Energy counters and the game is ready to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phases of each player’s turn are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draw:&lt;/strong&gt; Required. Draw until you have 4-7 cards in your hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place:&lt;/strong&gt; Optional. Play cards face-up and/or facedown.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt;: Optional. Attack one target with one machine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discard:&lt;/strong&gt; Required. You must discard one card from your hand and you may choose to discard one technology from the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until only one player has cards left in their deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on placing cards and attacking, check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://warcothegame.com/how-to-play/&quot;&gt;full rules&lt;/a&gt; of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/warco/skyhammer.png&quot; alt=&quot;Militant Skyhammer&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
War Co. contains only cards and some flimsy counters. The quality of the counters isn’t really that important because they’re just used to track energy a counted effects. They’re more functional than anything and can easily be replaced with glass counters, dice, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cards are your pretty standard ECG fare as far as the quality of the physical cards themselves. Where the cards &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; shine is the artwork, which is provided by James Masino. Pretty much the top 3/4 of each card is filled with beautiful, borderless illustrations. It’s really striking. I must have spent a good 20-30 minutes just going through each deck and checking out the amazing detail of every piece of artwork in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War Co. is super-easy to pick up and play within 5 minutes of opening a deck. There’s currently 6 decks available, each with their own style of play. You can, of course, build your own custom deck to play with, though I’d recommend playing each deck a few times to get a feel for them before mixing everything up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the game is simple to learn there’s plenty of depth here when it comes to managing energy, playing cards face-down vs face-up, and all the different card combinations. A game takes around an hour to play and it’s generally a back a forth until one player can get a slight upper hand and pull out a victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only played War Co. with my oldest son so far, and he enjoyed it right off the bat. I, on the other hand, was a bit more skeptical at first. Our first game was the Bruiser deck against the Militant deck and it felt like a slog going back and forth until my son knocked me out over an hour later. I was almost ready to give up on the game at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He enjoyed the game so much he convinced me to try again, this time with a different deck. What a difference that made! He stuck with the Bruiser deck, but I tried the Conspirator deck. This deck offered me a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more depth and strategy and I enjoyed the game a lot more. If you’re looking into checking out War Co. I’d suggest reading their &lt;a href=&quot;http://warcothegame.com/buyer-guide/&quot;&gt;buying guide&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for which decks will work out with the style of play you like the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then we’ve played a handful of games, seeing how different decks work against each other. I’m really glad I gave the game a second chance because it’s one I really do enjoy playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to checking out more War Co. offerings in the future. I’m really hoping more decks get released!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - 3DPrinterSpencer Low Poly Tabletop Units</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have been seeking out quality sources for good 3D prints. In my search, I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/3DPrinterSpencer?ref=custom_order_convo&quot;&gt;3DPrinterSpencer&lt;/a&gt;. Spencer McGuire out of Valdosta, Georgia, prints and sells a number of gaming items on Etsy.com (like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/502645852/nintendo-switch-charging-stand-dock-3d?ref=shop_home_feat_3&quot;&gt;charging dock for Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; or this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/517793039/nintendo-switch-joycon-mini-grip?ref=listing-shop-header-0&quot;&gt;Joycon Mini-Grip&lt;/a&gt;). In particular, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/499965343/low-poly-dd-tabletop-units?ref=shop_home_active_21&quot;&gt;Low-Poly D&amp;amp;D Tabletop Units&lt;/a&gt; got my attention. The designs for these prints can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1256348&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Each unit is printed using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MakerGear-M2-Desktop-3D-Printer/dp/B00ELUOERA/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1489809128&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;amp;keywords=gearmaker+m2&quot;&gt;MakerGear M2&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HATCHBOX-3D-PLA-1KG1-75-RED-Filament-Dimensional/dp/B00J0GO8I0/ref=pd_sim_328_6?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B00J0GO8I0&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=REJCP5K13TT6Y4YGJ6XZ&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=9wblF&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=2dYPI&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=REJCP5K13TT6Y4YGJ6XZ&quot;&gt;Hatchbox filament&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3DPrinterSpencer/printerspencer1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3DPrinterSpencer Low Poly&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, 3DPrinterSpencer offers 12 different units from several different factions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knight with Sword&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dwarf with Axe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elf with Bow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dwarf with Two Barrels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knight on Horse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human Mage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goblin with Two Swords&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goblin with Spear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goblin with Barrel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big Ogre&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Horde Mage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3DPrinterSpencer/printerspencer2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3DPrinterSpencer Low Poly&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each unit costs $1.50 and must be ordered in sets of 3 ($4.50 total). Whether starting a new RPG or tabletop campaign, designing your own game, or just want some company for your office desk, these units are a bargain. Like most 3D-printed items, they are a bit delicate. However, this is to be expected and overall they are of great quality and are extremely affordable. I already want to get my hands on a few more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Boardgame</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/billted/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bill &amp;amp; Ted's Excellent Board Game&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Sam Mitschke, Randy Scheunemann &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjgames.com/billandted/&quot;&gt;Steve Jackson Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.warehouse23.com/products/bill-and-teds-excellent-boardgame&quot;&gt;$24.95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 25–50 Min&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 10+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; No&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/189166/bill-teds-excellent-boardgame&quot;&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Ted’s Excellent Boardgame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strange things are afoot at the Circle K…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Ted need to collect famous people throughout time to pass their history test, form their band, Wyld Stallyns, and make sure the future is totally non-heinous. There’s a problem, though. With every historical figure they pick up their time-travelling phone booth takes some bogus turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always remember to be excellent to each other . . . and PARTY ON, DUDES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/billted/billtedcollage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bill &amp;amp; Ted Pieces&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
The goal of Bill &amp;amp; Ted’s Excellent Boardgame is to gather more historical figures than any other player before time, the deck of cards, runs out. There’s also baddies on the board that can knock your collected figures out of your phone booth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that start of the game, each pile of historical figure piles will be placed randomly at certain locations on the board with the princesses in the middle. Both the knight and cowboy are placed in their respective places on board. Depending on the number of players, the phone booths are placed with their arrows facing the center of the board. Facing is important in the game, so always make sure your arrow is pointed in the right direction! After the initial hand of cards is drawn for each player the game begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each round players will be playing two cards, each having movement directions for both the player’s phone booth and baddies. The player who played a card with the lowest number goes first, followed by the other players in initiative order. Note that only the lowest number of the two cards counts when determining initiative. The players then move their pieces and the bad guys in the order their cards were played. If a player lands on a historic figure they take the top tile off the stack and place it face down to the left of other tiles they’ve collected. If they land on a baddie, or a baddie lands on them, they lose their leftmost historical figure on the space they currently reside in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone has taken their turn new cards are drawn to the players’ hands and any historical figure tiles are flipped face up. Here’s where things get wonky. Every figure has a direction icon when flipped. These directions must be placed &lt;em&gt;in order&lt;/em&gt; before the directions on the cards are played. This makes planning out your moves a bit more difficult the more figures you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until the deck of cards runs out. The player with the most historical figures at the end of the game wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything, with the exception of the cards, in Bill &amp;amp; Ted’s Excellent Boardgame is made from sturdy cardboard. There are plastic stands to make the bad guys and phone booths stand up, and they’re pretty standard fare. What really brings the game up a notch is the artwork by Len Peralta which manages to capture the Bill &amp;amp; Ted feel with a humorous comic look. All of your favorite Bill &amp;amp; Ted characters are brought to life in a familiar way without having to resort to cheesy movie stills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a bit more than I was expecting from Bill &amp;amp; Ted’s Excellent Boardgame. Under the guise of a classic 80’s comedy with cartoony art is a competent movement programming game. Players constantly have to gauge the board, their historical figure tiles, and their hand of cards to optimize their movement. Of course, it can all go out the window if they don’t snag initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So was I expecting this much thought to be put into playing a game about two righteous dudes out to start a band, get the princesses, and save the universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad my expectations were blown out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part? The game is presented in a way where I had no trouble getting my kids to learn and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it’s time they saw the movie!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Warlock's Tower</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wizardstower/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Warlock's Tower&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://midipixel.com/warlockstower/&quot;&gt;Midipixel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whippering.com/&quot;&gt;Whippering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/530370/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/warlocks-tower/id1111603555&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.midipixel.warlockstower&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $9.99 (Steam) / $1.99 (Mobile)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been sitting on this review of Warlock’s Tower for too long, mostly because I thought I had already written it! Developed by Minipixel and published by Whippering for Steam, iOS, and Google Play, Warlock’s Tower tries to capture the look and feel of old Gameboy games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it succeed? Read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Warlock’s Tower, you play as a mail carrier trying to deliver a package to a warlock. Unfortunately, you need to climb to the very top of his tower to give him his parcel. Not only that, but the tower is slowly killing you as you walk its floors. Oh yeah, there’s monsters too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start the game with 3 life. Every step you take drops your life by 1. Thankfully there’s numbered gems throughout each level. Grab one of these to refill your life to that number. You’ll need to keep doing this until you’ve made your way to the room’s exit. Keep in mind, if you pick up a 5 gem and then immediately walk over a 3 gem you’ll lose lives. They’re not cumulative. You’ll always get the exact amount of life as the gem you pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the game in a nutshell. There are some other obstacles and tricks to discover, like monsters that move towards you for every 3 steps you take, the ability to set a mid-point if you die, or other characters to tag-team levels with.  The basis of the game will always hold true, though. 1 step. 1 life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warlock’s Tower is more than just a throwback to simpler times. Extreme care has been taken to make sure it looks, feels, and sounds just like and old Gameboy game. The only thing that’s not exactly the same as the old handheld system is the aspect ratio of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a visual and auditory treat for those who grew up playing on a spinach-green screen while trying best to tilt the screen towards the best light source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenshots are awesome, but it’s best to see the game in motion and get a bit of the soundtrack too. Check out the trailer below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yj_pQvwD8FM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t give Warlock’s Tower any higher praise. When I first started playing it was a few hours before I finally pulled myself away and unglued my eyes from the screen. The simplicity of gameplay mixed with the depth and challenge of the puzzles makes the game a real winner. Combine that with a solid price point on both mobile and PC and there’s no reason any child of the 80’s shouldn’t own this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rare, with all the games that come in for review, that I go back to games in my library multiple times. Warlock’s Tower is one I still fire up and enjoy, even though there’s a stack of other games that need attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Battle Princess Madelyn Kickstarter</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/causalbitgames/battle-princess-madelyn/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Creative Director Christopher Obritsch daughter Madelyn wanted to be in Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, and fight “Green Head”, he said it was someone else’s game - but he could make her one that was like it. “But girls can’t be knights, Daddy. Only boys…” she said, to which he answered “Pshh…What color do you want your armor to be?”. The answer? Pink! And that’s how this game started. Chris’ daughter Madelyn loves the first stage of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts and makes him play it over and over because she wants to see him fight “Green Head”, the Shielder boss at the end of the first stage. It’s not hard for her to twist his rubber arm, as it’s been his favorite game since it came out all those years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you saw my earlier post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Battle-Princess-Madelyn-Coming-Out-of-Greenlight/&quot;&gt;Battle Princess Madelyn&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve seen those words before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle Princess Madelyn has finally hit Kickstarter and it’s a project you’re going to want to back. There’s tons of rewards to be had besides getting an amazing game. I’ve been playing the early alpha version, and have been super impressed with the attention to detail, amazing graphics, and modern take on the Ghouls ‘n Ghosts-style gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bare minimum? $15 (CA $20). That gets you a Steam copy of the game, a DRM-free copy of the game, and a copy of Insanity’s Blade. You also get an in-game credit. Not too bad, right? The game is certainly worth more than $15 in my mind. As you go up in pledge levels you can get shirts, art books, the soundtrack, and even a limited physical release of the game for the platform of your choice. Wanna go nuts? Pledge $5000 to get your face on one of the in-game bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle Princess Madelyn is just about halfway funded with 29 days left to go as of this writing. The game is already being worked on, so I can’t imagine it’ll be too far from released once its funded. I’d hop on this train now and get yourself some sweet swag along with a brilliant game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - KhromaZones</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/khromazones/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KhromaZones&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Darrin Horbal &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dphstudioz.com/khromazones.html&quot;&gt;DPH Studioz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;lt;30 min&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 12+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.thegamecrafter.com/1489627944/KhromaZones%20Rules.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was first introduced to DPH Studioz’ games when I had a chance to sit down with designer Darrin Horbal and play his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2014/06/unpublishedstarguard/&quot;&gt;Star Guard&lt;/a&gt; prototype. KhromaZones is a departure from the last game, containing only an unthemed deck of cards with squeaky-clean design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game isn’t available for purchase yet but will soon be via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/khromazones1&quot;&gt;The Game Crafter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of KhromaZones is simple: have the most points at the end of the game. The game can end two ways: when a player needs to play a card and can’t or when a player has captures 4 zones in a row. The latter is an automatic win for that player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before play seven zones are laid out across the table. Each player takes a set of cards, either the light deck of the dark deck. Both decks contain identical cards. These are shuffled and placed in front of the players as their draw decks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn a player must take the follow actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draw&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play a card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Draw phase, the player must declare how many cards they’re going to draw. 1, 2, or 3 cards may be drawn, but no more than 3 cards be a player’s hand at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the play phase, a player will place on of their cards down on their side of one of the seven zones. The goal is to claim zones by having 3 different color gems down in front of a zone. If this happens a claim card of the player’s color is placed in front of the zone. A player can also negate an opponent’s card by playing a gem of the same color across from it. If this happens both cards are removed from play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One a player has played their card they may choose to keep 1 card in their hand until their next turn. Any other cards in their hand are discarded. A player doesn’t have to hold and may discard all the cards left in their hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until a player has claimed 4 zones in a row or there are no cards to play. Once the game ends scoring begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring in KhromaZone has several layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A player’s largest group of claimed zones earns 100 points for each claim.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other claims are worth 10 points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individual gems on the board are worth 1 point each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player with the most points wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the full rules, including solitaire rules, check &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.thegamecrafter.com/1489627944/KhromaZones%20Rules.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also check out Darrin’s awesome how-to video below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbMtQhmnivw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KhromaZones’ cards are of typical Game Crafter quality. For those who are unfamiliar, they’re sturdy and resilient, but not quite the level of a standard playing card. The design of the cards is another matter. While the game has a very minimal design, it’s impeccable. The gems pop off the cards and everything is laid out in a way that makes it easy to see what you need to know at a glance, even if the cards are stacked on a zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KhromaZones is exactly what it appears to be on the surface, a light, abstract card game. It’s quick to play, extremely easy to learn, and while the box says it’s for ages 12+, younger children will have no problem picking it up. To be honest, KhromaZones feels like the card of card game you could walk into your nearest big box store and snag off the shelf, though much better thought and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for an excellent filler game that can easily be setup and played by 2 players, look no further than KhromaZones. There’s certainly a bit more strategy than meets the eye here. Do you rush in aggressively trying to claim zones, or work on foiling your opponent’s every move? Do you slowly make your way through the deck trying to make the most out of your cards, or burn through in hopes you can end the game before the other player has a chance to capture more zones?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KhromaZones should be available on The Game Crafter soon, and it’s one you should certainly give a try.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - 3D Central Life Counter and Dice Box</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3dcentralva.com/&quot;&gt;3D Central&lt;/a&gt; is a local operation based out of Richmond, Virginia. They offer a variety of 3D printing equipment and accessories. The store has been owned and operated by Chris Caswell and Cyndi Laird since 2011, when they bought their first 3D Printer and opened up an online store together. In addition to some really innovative services, like one-on-one training and education offered at their brick-and-mortar store location, 3D Central sells a number of 3D-printed gaming supplies (like this awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/227317100/dice-tower-3d-printed-folding-castle?ga_search_query=dice+tower&amp;amp;ref=shop_items_search_1&quot;&gt;Folding Castle Dice Tower&lt;/a&gt;) through their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3dcentralva.com/shop1/retail/&quot;&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt; and through Etsy.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown here are two examples of some items offered by 3D Central. The first is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/227411403/life-counter-3d-printed-custom-colors?ga_search_query=counter&amp;amp;ref=shop_items_search_3&quot;&gt;3D-Printed Life Counter&lt;/a&gt;. This counter is customizable by color, allowing the purchaser to select both the dial and stand colors separately. This counter is great to have on your table to keep score, count rounds, hit points, or anything else. The counter sells for $15 and was originally designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com/CarryTheWhat/about&quot;&gt;CarryTheWhat&lt;/a&gt; and is available for download on thingiverse.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3DCentral/3DCentral1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3D Central Life Counter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second item shown is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/155738254/die-of-holding-d20-dice-box-storage-box?ga_search_query=dice+box&amp;amp;ref=shop_items_search_1&quot;&gt;D20 Dice Box&lt;/a&gt;. 3D Central sells this box for $17. You can purchase it through 3D Central’s online store or through their shop on Etsy.com. The box itself is approximately 3” wide. The inside compartment measures approximately 2” x 2”. The box pictured below is shown next to a $1 coin for size comparison. This open-source model was also designed by CarryTheWhat and is available for download &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:624031&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This box is great to hold tokens, rings, or anything that you’d like. It has a magnetized swiveling lid, so it shuts tightly without the worry that it will open unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/3DCentral/3DCentral2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3D Central d20 Dice Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever find yourself browsing online for gaming supplies (or in Richmond, Virginia) check these guys out, it is worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Items were provided free for review by 3D Central.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Salt Lands</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with Antler Games’ Salt Lands the first time I laid eyes on the box. It’s strikingly minimal, with wonderful character art. Inside all the components follow suit with a heavy post-apocalyptic feel that still plays on muted colors and excellent graphic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had a chance to get it to the table yet, but it the game is half as good as how it looks I think this may become an easy favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Meduris: Call of the Gods</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I think of HABA I think of yellow-boxed, family friendly games. Games that are easy to learn, play in minutes, and that tend to cater to a younger audience.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habausa.com/meduris-the-call-of-the-gods.html&quot;&gt;Meduris&lt;/a&gt; turned that idea on its head. Here’s a more traditional Euro-style game for an older audience that takes over an hour to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meduris contains a bunch of wooden goodies, some 3D cardboard pieces, and an absolutely beautiful board.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - InspiredCraftwork Imperial Assault Tokens and Storage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Piggybacking off my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Broken-Egg-Games-Imperial-Assault-Tokens-Review/&quot;&gt;recent reviews&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brokenegggames.com/destiny-token-sets.html&quot;&gt;Broken Egg Games’ custom acrylic Imperial Assault tokens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Feldherr-Imperial-Assault-Foam-Tray-Review/&quot;&gt;Feldherr’s foam trays&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to take a moment to spotlight the print work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/InspiredCraftwork?utm_source=transactional&amp;amp;amp%3Butm_medium=trans_email&amp;amp;amp%3Butm_campaign=convo_html&amp;amp;campaign_label=convo_notifications&amp;amp;utm_campaign=convo_notifications_010170_10683759063_0_0&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;email_sent=1488829624&amp;amp;euid=EJZRzuYdCOntgG_BHUVhrRG86h2G&amp;amp;eaid=104721686274&amp;amp;x_eaid=df316947c2&quot;&gt;InspiredCraftwork&lt;/a&gt;, a custom print shop out of Daly City, California, owned and operated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/people/DerickHui&quot;&gt;Derick Hui&lt;/a&gt;. InspiredCraftwork prints a number of 3D items that you can purchase on Etsy.com, such as dice towers, buff tokens and markers for Magic the Gathering, and search tokens for Descent. Included in their collection are a handful of items to customize your Star Wars: Imperial Assault set, such as squad and activation tokens that fit neatly underneath the bases of your models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imperialassault/inspired1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;InspiredCraftwork 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorites are the 3D-printed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/451982826/star-wars-imperial-assault-terminal?ref=shop_home_active_3&quot;&gt;terminal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/451062528/star-wars-imperial-assault-crate-tokens?ref=shop_home_active_4&quot;&gt;crate tokens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/465119321/star-wars-imperial-assault-doors-closed?ref=shop_home_active_11&quot;&gt;door markers&lt;/a&gt;. These sets sell for $10 a piece or $30 for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/473929064/star-wars-imperial-assault-tokens-basic?ref=shop_home_active_20&quot;&gt;entire set&lt;/a&gt;. They also offer a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/451635856/star-wars-imperial-assault-doors-set-of?ref=shop_home_active_14&quot;&gt;mixed set of open and closed doors&lt;/a&gt; for $20. These 3D-printed tokens are high quality with few (if any) irregularities and possess a great level of detail. They look great on their own or could be painted. InspiredCraftwork offers 3 color options: grey, white, and black. With the high cost of custom Imperial Assault pieces in general, these sets are a great buy. They also look great on your board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imperialassault/inspired2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;InspiredCraftwork 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also offered is a token organizer for all of the organization freaks out there (like me).  The organizer sells for $28, is offered with three unique lid options (Imperial, Rebel, or Mandalorian), and comes in a wide variety of colors. You can even purchase a skirmish tray option if you play mostly skirmish. This organizer holds a large amount of sorted tokens with room for your dice beneath. The token trays are removable for easy reach during gameplay. All in all, a great buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imperialassault/inspired3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;InspiredCraftwork 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tokens and token organizer were provided free for review by InspiredCraftwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176631/stratos&quot;&gt;Stratos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about Stratos on Instagram of all places. Drawn in by the artwork of the game’s new expansion, I messaged Board &amp;amp; Tale seeing if they’d be interested in a review. It wasn’t long before I had the base game and expansion in my greedy paws and popped the box to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stratos is described as a Euro-style and strategy battle game, wrapped in a light fantasy theme. Does it live up to that description? Read on, traveler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot going on in Stratos, but it pretty much boils down to movement and actions. There are 5 different character classes that each have their own actions they can take. Mages can cast spells, Soldiers and Archers can attack, Peasants can farm resources, and Explorers can search for treasure. As the game progresses each class can be upgraded to become more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players win the game by being the first one to gain 10 Prosperity Points (PP). This can be done 4 ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoarding Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can trade in 1 of each type of resource for a Hoard Token worth 1PP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defeating Enemies:&lt;/strong&gt; Kill an enemy unit for a 1PP Defeat Token.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casting Spells:&lt;/strong&gt; Each time a player casts a new spell for the first time they earn 1PP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Treasure:&lt;/strong&gt; Find a piece of treasure for a quick 1PP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s actually 2 more ways to earn some bonus PP. One is having the promoted version of all 5 classes on the board at once. That’s worth 2PP. The other is to occupy 3 special tiles on the board. This is also worth 2PP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of different scenarios and map layouts in the main rulebook to play. There’s also several more on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stratosgame.com/maps.html&quot;&gt;Board &amp;amp; Tale’s site&lt;/a&gt;. Each scenario provides a different challenge and has multiple ways for players to win. Stratos also has a recently-released expansion, Light in the Darkness, which adds monsters to the game. The cool part? It’s fully stand-alone for 2 players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on how to play Stratos, I recommend heading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stratosgame.com/play.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;d, reading the rules and watching the videos. I barely scratched the surface in my above description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, Let’s talk pieces. Stratos has a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of cardboard packed into its box. It’s no lie that it took me a good 20 minutes just to punch everything out. Another 10 to figure out how to store it all. I wish I had known Board &amp;amp; Tale has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stratosgame.com/setup-and-put-away.html&quot;&gt;setup &amp;amp; storage&lt;/a&gt; guide on their site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the pieces are thick cardboard and are very sturdy. The wooden bits are pretty standard and are what you’d expect from a modern board game. The cards have a wonderful linen finish and contain some beautiful artwork. The map boards are a nice touch so your map tiles don’t slide all over the place while you’re trying to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest features, however, are the characters. Each cardboard character token has a plastic stand to keep it upright. They also have several notches to attack health &amp;amp; spirit markers, promotion markers, items, etc… It’s always easy to take a look at a character on the board and tell exactly what’s going on with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be a lot in Stratos, but it’s all well made and has a purpose. It’s probably a good idea to have something to store the pieces in on your table when you sit down to play, otherwise, you’re going to have stuff &lt;em&gt;all over the place&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/stratos/stratoscharacter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stratos Characters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first played through the Stratos tutorial scenario with my 6-year-old son. What great about this is that walks you through two full turns for each player before giving you the run of things on your own. In those two turns, you get a good feel for what each character class can do. After we were finished with those turns we were easily able to pick up and play to the conclusion of our game with no issues…except for the fact that I had my butt handed to me by my little guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the game. While there’s certainly a bit of randomness, there’s plenty of strategy to the game when it comes to how to use your actions, what units to field, when to activate/upgrade them, what areas of the board to try and control, etc… There’s a lot of game to go along with the multitude of bits inside Stratos’ box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stratos may not be everyone’s cup of tea. It doesn’t feel much like a Euro-style game but is certainly packed full of strategy. For me, it hits a lot of sweet points. Yes, there’s some randomness due to dice but there’s certainly enough ways the game balances that out. You’ll certainly get your $60 worth from the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the rules and tutorial videos. If you’re even slightly intrigued then I’d suggest you snag a copy of the expansion, Light in the Darkness, first.  It can be played stand-alone with 2 players. Like what you get? Spring for the core game. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of the Stratos and its expansion, Light in the Darkness, were provided free for review by Board &amp;amp; Tale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Privateer Press - WARMACHINE March Releases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Privateer Press has released its March collection. You can find the full release schedule here.  Pictured below are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/books/forces-of-warmachine-cygnar&quot;&gt;PIP 1080 Forces of WARMACHINE: Cygnar Softcover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PIP Code: 1023 &lt;br /&gt;
Price: $34.99 &lt;br /&gt;
Cover Type: Soft Cover &lt;br /&gt;
Hardcover Available: Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/cygnar/warcasters/captain-allison-jakes&quot;&gt;PIP 31122 Captain Allison Jakes (Jakes II) - Cygnar Warcaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Base Size: 30mm &lt;br /&gt;
PIP Code: 31122 &lt;br /&gt;
Price: $15.99&lt;br /&gt;
Model Materials: Metal &lt;br /&gt;
Model Count: 1 &lt;br /&gt;
Packaging: Blister &lt;br /&gt;
Release Date: March 08, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/cygnar/warjacks/brickhouse&quot;&gt;PIP 31123 Brickhouse - Cygnar Heavy Warjack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Base Size: 50mm &lt;br /&gt;
PIP Code: 31123 &lt;br /&gt;
Price: $59.99&lt;br /&gt;
Model Materials: Metal, Resin &lt;br /&gt;
Model Count: 1 &lt;br /&gt;
Packaging: Box &lt;br /&gt;
Release Date: March 08, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/privateermarch1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Privateer March Releases&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These products are top-notch. Cygar’s Brickhouse Heavy Warjack is a metal and resin model with an MSRP of $59.99. Included in the box is a unique character card denoting the units various stats and abilities. The level of detail on this model is outstanding. Due to Brickhouse’s Bond [Maddox] ability, the warjack makes a great follow-up purchase for any player who previously picked up the Cygnar Battlegroup Box (PIP 31121). Brickhouse also pairs well with hard-hitting warcasters such as Lord Commander Stryker (PIP 31034), Captain Jeremiah Kraye (PIP 31052), and Captain E. Dominic Darius (PIP 31031).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/privateermarch2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Privateer March Releases&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Captain Allison Jakes is a smaller, all metal miniature. However, there is no lack of detail. Similarly, included in the packaging is her unique character cards containing stats, abilities, and spells and a 30 mm base. Her MSRP is $15.99. This is the full warcaster version of the character solo Lieutenant Allison Jakes. With plenty of abilities that increase the effectiveness of her warjacks, Captain Allison Jakes pairs very well with Cygnar’s heavy-hitting warjacks, such as the Centurion and Hammersmith, as well as with units like Cygnar’s Sword Knights, whose Flank [friendly Faction warjack] ability synergizes exceptionally well with both Positive Charge and Powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am most excited about the literature release for March. The Forces of Cygnar printed materials are outstanding. Included are beautiful, crisp photos of the Cygnar product line, specific character pages detailing abilities and rules, vivid illustrations, a painting guide, and AOE templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/privateer/privateermarch3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Privateer March Releases&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Privateer Press. We cannot wait until April.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PAX East 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://east.paxsite.com/&quot;&gt;PAX East&lt;/a&gt; starts today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it didn’t work out for me to attend today, but I’ll be there tomorrow hitting up all sorts of cool digital and tabletop gaming goodness. I probably won’t be posting anything until I get back, but you can always check my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/pawnsperspective/&quot;&gt;Instagram feed&lt;/a&gt; for anything cool I see at the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lined up a few great appointments, mostly with smaller video game booths, and then will be bumming around the tabletop area seeing what’s new, meeting con-friends, and trying to play a few pick-up games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to give a shout if you see me! I always love meeting new people. We may even have time to sit down to a game together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If PAX East turns out like it usually does, I’ll have a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of stuff to play and post about in the coming weeks. Keep your eyes peeled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to PAX East? Leave a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Dragoon: The Barbarian and Rogue Expansion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dragoon/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dragoon&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designers:&lt;/strong&gt;  Jake Given, Zach Given, Jonathan Ritter-Roderick &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laywastegames.com/&quot;&gt;Lay Waste Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 13+&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172540/dragoon&quot;&gt;Dragoon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first had a chance to give &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/03/kickstarter-previewdragoon/&quot;&gt;Dragoon a shot&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015, shortly after PAX East while Lay Waste Games was still Kickstarting the game. It was a bit of time after that when my Full Metal Mantis edition of the game arrived with its full-color cloth map, all-metal pieces, and all the awesome gameplay crammed into that tiny box. My kids and I have been enjoying it ever since. Now Lay Waste Games has launched a new Kickstarter for a Dragoon expansion, The Barbarian and Rogue. It adds two playable human characters to the mix with different rules than the dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, they’re also reprinting Dragoon in both plastic and metal editions. There’s also an &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt; Wyrmwood Gaming board to be had at the highest reward level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;563&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/laywastegames/dragoon-the-rogue-and-barbarian-expansion-reprint/widget/video.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Barbarian and Rogue play differently than your standard dragon does. I mean, come on, are you going to just walk into a city and demand tribute if you’re but a puny human?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbarian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s got a boat! This immediately makes him awesome right from the start. Who doesn’t love boats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Barbarian is similar to dragons in many ways but must level up to use more powerful cards. Barbarians also lose a level if they lost in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does a Barbarian level up? Tribute! The Barbarian earns a level for every gold it earns during its Tribute phase. You can’t go above level 5 because there’s nothing above level 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few other differences with the Barbarian. Instead of stealing a dragon’s gold from its cave he can &lt;em&gt;smash&lt;/em&gt; is. That dragon loses 3 gold but the Barbarian gains none. Then there’s the boat. The boat always sits right on the board in whatever row/column the Barbarian is in. The Barbarian can board the boat if it’s next to it to move anywhere along the edge of the board. You need to be careful, though. The boat always holds 3 of the Barbarian’s gold which can be lost of the Rogue or a dragon destroys the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rogue is a sneaky bugger who can use their bag of equipment to do all sorts of nasty things on the board. They can also use tunnels to quickly pop from one end of the board to another and loot villages and cities claimed by other players. They can even do this to loot dragon’s caves. The catch? The Rogue can only have 4 equipment cards active at a time. This makes planning your moves and equipment set very important throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with equipment the Rogue also has the ability to steal gold from villages/cities it’s standing on without destroying them. It can only do this once per city per turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rogues are also a bit fragile when it comes to fighting dragons and barbarians. They automatically lose all combat if their Poison Dagger is not equipped. To help balance things out a Rogue can only be brought into combat by landing on another player or another player landing on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want more details on the expansion rules? You can find them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/jv36dw5moa5prj1/Dragoon_instructions_012317.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (still a work in progress).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pieces, as expected, are amazing. Since I already have a metal edition of Dragoon, Lay Waste sent me the Copper Ox Barbarian and Nickel OX Rogue. Both live up to their metal dragon brethren in awesomeness. In fact, I may like them even more than the painted metal dragons I have because the color on these won’t chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion contains everything you’ll need to play these two characters, including the characters themselves, scoring token, a freakin’ &lt;em&gt;boat&lt;/em&gt;, cards, reference cards, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I mentioned how cool the metal &lt;strong&gt;boat&lt;/strong&gt; is? No. It’s &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made it clear several times over the past two years how much I love Dragoon, even though my kids aren’t nice enough to ever let me win. Well, you know what? Daddy wins when he plays as the Rogue. Take that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion adds a fresh take on gameplay and really makes you think how to plan out your moves. The Rogue is quick, sneaky, and has wonderful tools at their disposal. They’re also vulnerable if they doesn’t have his poison dagger equipped. The Barbarian is beefy and has a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;boat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but takes a bit of time to work up some steam. They both have different ways of scoring, and take a bit of getting used to, but can be &lt;em&gt;devastating&lt;/em&gt; on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also delicious, which an experience dragon player will know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragoon is already an amazing game. The Barbarian and Rogue expansion continue on with the awesomeness by bringing in some fresh gameplay and the ability to handle more players on the board at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BOAT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of the Dragoon Rogue and Barbarian expansion was provided free for review by Lay Waste Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s got 240 card sleeves, 4 dividers, 1 Captain Koska promo card, and can fit up to 500 of your fully-sleeved Hero Realms cards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me show you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/herorealms/legion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Legion Supplies Hero Realms Cardbox&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I had gotten White Wizard Games’ Star Realms I was sent a Legion Supplies box for the game to store it in. I loved it, as the Star Realms box wears out pretty quickly. Hero Realms, on the other hand, has a sturdier box. Why would I need another storage box for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized how stupid I was to think that. Between Character Packs, the upcoming Campaign Deck, and who-knows-what-else will be coming out for the game, I need to make sure I was prepared! Luckily Legion shot me over a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legionsupplies.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=33_34&amp;amp;products_id=370&quot;&gt;Hero Realms Cardbox&lt;/a&gt; to take a look at (pictured above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might be asking, “Why wouldn’t I just go buy a plain, white cardbox and some clear sleeves for my copy of Hero Realms?” That’s because you, my friend, do not fully appreciate the importance of how your games look on the shelf! Also, that white box and clear sleeves will most likely be of a lesser quality than this Hero Realms set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention the Captain Koska promo card? I think I may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All kidding aside, this is an excellent set for those who love the game and are looking to future-proof their collection a bit. The box is above average cardbox quality with colorful Hero Realms art adorning it. The sleeves are matte, fit the cards snugly, and have the same art as the back of the Hero Realms cards on their backs. The dividers are a thick cardboard and are nice for separating out starting cards, Character Decks, etc… You’ve also got a lot of room left over in the box for future Hero Realms releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I was a bit concerned about having my cards sliding around the box since it wasn’t filled after sleeving my collection. I was pleasantly surprised to find the original Hero Realms box fits neatly inside this cardbox, securely holding my current cards without needing some other kind of filler. Bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set will run you $20, which is more than the base set of Hero Realms. You’re getting some good bang for your buck with just the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legionsupplies.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=33_34&amp;amp;products_id=365&quot;&gt;card sleeves&lt;/a&gt; alone, so it’s worth it if you’re planning on sticking with Hero Realms for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Hero Realms Cardbox was provided free for review by Legion Supplies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mole Rats in Space Q&amp;A with Matt Leacock and Margaret Garrou</title>

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a chance to review Peaceable Kingdom’s new game, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Mole-Rats-in-Space-Review/&quot;&gt;Mole Rats in Space&lt;/a&gt;. The game was designed by Matt Leacock and is a bit of a departure from Peaceable’s usual fare. Matt Leacock and Margaret Garrou from Peaceable Kingdom were kind enough to answer some of my questions regarding the game. Before we get into things I just want to say thanks to Matt and Margaret for taking the time to answer my questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Margaret Garrou&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Games Product Development Manager&lt;/em&gt;, Peaceable Kingdom
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/interviews/margaret-garrou.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Margaret Garrou&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 20px;margin-bottom:20px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the relationship with Matt come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peaceable Kingdom has been a fan of Matt Leacock’s games Forbidden Island and Pandemic for years. As a company that produces cooperative games, we were extremely keen to work with Matt, the inventor of two of the most popular cooperative games of all time. We were introduced to Matt by Susan McKinley Ross, the inventor of Qwirkle and the Peaceable Kingdom game, Hoot Owl Hoot. After a few years of bouncing ideas off of Matt, one finally stuck. Peaceable Kingdom is thrilled to be publishing Matt Leacock’s first cooperative game for kids!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the process of developing/publishing Mole Rats in Space like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peaceable Kingdom pitched Matt the idea of a cooperative version of Snakes and Ladders, the ancient Indian game, but on a round-style board where players are trying to reach the center. Matt was intrigued by the idea and came back to us only a few days later with the concept of Snakes and Mole Rats. It instantly made sense to us because mole rats are cooperative animals and snakes are mole rats’ only predator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once we agreed on this concept, Matt quickly fleshed out the game further and began a months-long process of play testing it with friends, family, and strangers at conventions. He kept detailed notes about his findings from play testing and the tweaks he made to the game based on that. Matt’s developmental process was very thorough and collaborative. Working with Matt was a pleasure and a highlight of our year!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was Matt involved in any/all changes from initial design to final publishing of the game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The initial game had the mole rats running around an underground burrow with snakes popping in and out of it. We decided it would be fun to anthropomorphize our mole rat characters by putting them up in space. They are tough little creatures who are used to the dark and live and work cooperatively—who better to send up into space! *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt was involved in the game design every step of the way.  The final board, cards, and paper components are reflective of the designs that Matt sent us. At the last stage of the design process, Matt play-tested the final version of the game to help us put the finishing touches on the package design, components, and rules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Might we see more games from more well-known designers in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope so! ☺ Peaceable Kingdom currently carries games designed by Peggy Brown, Susan McKinley Ross, Joyce Johnson, and Department of Recreation (to name a few). They are all designers who have successful games in the marketplace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The game is a bit harder to win than standard Peaceable Kingdom fair. Was this a concern at all during development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peaceable Kingdom was looking to reach a slightly older game player than most of our current games, which range from ages 2-6 years. Mole Rats in Space seemed to have the right amount of complexity to keep gamer kids engaged and because it’s a cooperative game, appeal to non-gamer kids who can help each other if the game feels difficult. The rules are definitely longer and more complex than Peaceable Kingdom’s other games, but we feel confident that families who enjoy our cooperative games will love the challenge!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Matt Leacock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Designer&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/interviews/matt-leacock.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Matt Leacock&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 20px;margin-bottom:20px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did the idea for Mole Rats in Space come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peaceable Kingdom approached me, wondering if I could design an entirely new cooperative game for them using snakes and ladders as a starting point. The idea sounded like a fun challenge. Earlier, they’d given me a blank slate to design on and I’d struggled for well over a year to come up with any ideas at all. It’s amazing how powerful constraints are to the creative process. While exploring the idea, I thought it might be fun for the players to be lemurs or naked mole rats. Lemurs attracted me because they’re adorable. Naked mole rats also sounded goofy and interesting, but I didn’t know much about them at the time. I learned that naked mole rats are eusocial animals – they live in a colony like ants – they are incredibly cooperative, and they made a perfect fit for the game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like designed a game for a much younger audience in mind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn’t adjust my process much at all, except to be sure that I tested with younger people. I brought the game to the neighborhood after school group that did a lot of testing for me and also mailed sets out to friends and colleagues with younger kids for blind testing. As for the design, I tried to ensure that the decisions were interesting and meaningful, but that the decision space wasn’t extremely large given the (short) target playtime. I settled on a structure where the cards are easy to execute – you either move left or right on most turns – but the implications aren’t always straightforward. It pays to look ahead and communicate with your teammates about their plans so you can coordinate moves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the game a design you had shopped around, or was it created specifically for Peaceable Kingdom and their audience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I designed it specifically for Peaceable Kingdom and their audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the theme the same from the start? If not, what was the original theme or did it just come about after mechanics were in place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I settled on mole rats fairly quickly, but initially had them fleeing their underground burrow from the invading snakes. Peaceable Kingdom wondered if it might be better if the game were set IN SPACE. The idea struck me as odd initially, but I quickly saw how the space setting could open up some really fun possibilities. You could blow snakes out the air vents! And the story seemed both sillier and more full of tension. Ultimately, the game turned out a bit like a rated G version of Aliens with everyone fleeing the ship before time runs out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was only after we decided on the theme, that we learned that mole rats make &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mslopatto/lets-build-a-naked-mole-rat-colony-in-space-988ed463dbd7#.rtfd4hfcb&quot;&gt;the perfect astronauts&lt;/a&gt; since they can survive with very little oxygen, never get cancer, don’t feel pain, lead extraordinarily long lives, and live together in a colony.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The game is a bit harder to win than standard Peaceable Kingdom fair. Was this a concern at all during development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, the game is very finely balanced with that difficulty very much in mind. I worked closely with Peaceable Kingdom on the balance: it was important that the game gave a good challenge to the kids and families to keep them coming back for more. We logged and played well over a hundred games in near-final form in order to tune it. I was amazed at how the addition or removal of 2 or 3 cards could make such a large difference to the overall difficulty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sneak Peek - Dragoon: The Rogue and Barbarian Expansion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love Lay Waste Games’ Dragoon. I love the design. I love the metal pieces. I love the gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love that there’s an expansion ready to go for the game that just needs to be funded once the Kickstarter campaign for it launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragoon: The Rogue and Barbarian Expansion adds two new playable characters to the game, adding both variety to play and the ability for the game to handle more players. Each of these new characters has their own special powers that help them compete against the mighty dragons. The Barbarian can level up to use more powerful cards and also has a ship to carry gold. The Rogue has a useful set of tools to give him special abilities throughout the game. He also has tunnels he can use to quickly travel across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lay Waste Games was kind enough to provide a review copy of the expansion for me to take a look at. Here’s some pics!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Double Dragon IV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/doubledragon/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Double Dragon IV&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arcsystemworks.jp/dd4/&quot;&gt;Arc System Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arcsystemworks.jp/dd4/&quot;&gt;Arc System Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; Yoshihisa Kishimoto&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/double-dragon-iv/cid=UP0036-CUSA07236_00-DD4MASTERNA00000&quot;&gt;Playstation 4&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/528610/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; $6.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember first playing Double Dragons in the arcade, popping quarter after quarter in the machine. I remember how my dad used to try and play, too, and I’d get frustrated and knock him into pits. I also remember how crazy my dad went looking for a copy of the NES version of Double Dragon when it was released for the home console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward and I had the same excitement for Double Dragon II and Double Dragon III. I loved the series as a kid. When I found out Double Dragon IV was coming out, and it looked exactly the same as the older titles? Aw, man. I was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That excitement waned pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with the Double Dragon series there’s not much new here. It’s a side-scrolling beat’em up where you punch and kick your way through the bad guys until you reach the end of the level. There are a few special moves you can use, like uppercuts, jump kicks, roundhouses, grabs, and throws. There’s also the occasional whip, bat, knife, wheel, or barrel to pick up and throw. Double Dragon IV is identical to the older games in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including terrible dialog in Story Mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also included in Double Dragon IV is the 2-player Battle Mode where you can fight against another player using characters, including enemies, unlocked during Story Mode. Along with 2-player Battle Mode is Tower Mode. Fight your way up each level of the tower with no continues to unlock more characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PS4 version of the game includes Share Play so your friends can join in the action even if they don’t own the game. Both players must be Playstation Plus members and play sessions are limited to 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double Dragon IV’s visuals are on par with Double Dragon III. Attention to detail is this aspect is amazing. Even the soundtrack sounds just like older games. It’s a complete retro throwback. Characters look just as cool, or as strange, as they did on the NES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hjUJFE7JHtc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being such a fan of the Double Dragon series I was really looking forward to playing IV. After playing for a few hours I walked away from the experience a bit disappointed. With all the excellent retro-style games I’ve been playing lately I thought it would be awesome to play a classic series developed just like the older games in the series were. Unfortunately, this just wasn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double Dragon IV feels a bit … stale. There was barely a challenge to playing the game, some of the level design felt really poor and rushed, and there just wasn’t enough diversity to keep me entertained. I fell back into the same old patterns of fighting bad guys that I used in my youth, and it just didn’t feel fun at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Steam copy of Double Dragon IV was provided free for review by Arc System Works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 x 10 Board Game Challenge February Plays</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;February is over. It’s now time to check how well I’m doing in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/10x10-Board-Game-Challenge/&quot;&gt;10x10 Board Game Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve played a lot of games this month…but not I’ve only gotten a few more plays in from my list.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-tak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tak&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cheapass.com/tak/&quot;&gt;Tak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Plays&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;7 Plays Total in 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 times with &lt;em&gt;different people&lt;/em&gt;. Not a shabby number!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-herorealms.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hero Realms&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitewizardgames.com/herorealms/&quot;&gt;White Wizard Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to get a game of Hero Realms in with my oldest son one night when he requested we play it instead of a new game. Yay! 1 play!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Review - Feldherr Imperial Assault Foam Tray</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who owns and plays &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lu6Ph3&quot;&gt;Star Wars: Imperial Assault&lt;/a&gt; by Fantasy Flight Games knows that there are a lot of box components. And, with Fantasy Flight releasing expansion after expansion—and hoards of solo units—the free space on my closet shelf is dwindling fast. Organization is also a problem. Where do you keep all of the game tiles, tokens, and cards? Additionally, where can you keep your painted minis safe and protected, but still neatly put away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the opportunity to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldherr.net/en/?_ga=1.11216948.1467377854.1488747760&quot;&gt;Feldherr’s foam organizational trays&lt;/a&gt;. These trays fit perfectly into your original game boxes and largely eliminate your organizational and storage worries. They are precisely cut to fit the specific components of each game. Feldherr also makes customizable foam trays so you can create your own. And with a 5-year warranty and a 60-day money back guarantee, you really can’t go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imperialassault/tray1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Feldherr Tray 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldherr.net/af050ia07-285-mm-x-285-mm-x-50-mm-2-inches-foam-tray-for-board-game-boxes/a-54751/&quot;&gt;AF050IA07&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldherr.net/afda085bo-85-mm-3-35-inches-foam-tray-for-star-wars-imperial-assault-board-game-box/a-54752/&quot;&gt;AFDA085BO&lt;/a&gt;. These two foam trays fit in tandem into the original base set box for Star Wars: Imperial Assault. They are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldherr.net/foam-tray-set-for-star-wars-imperial-assault-board-game-box/a-54774/&quot;&gt;sold as a set&lt;/a&gt; for 21.99€ or about $28. These foam inserts stack and fit perfectly into the game box. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldherr.net/af050ia07-285-mm-x-285-mm-x-50-mm-2-inches-foam-tray-for-board-game-boxes/a-54751/&quot;&gt;AF050IA07&lt;/a&gt; contains 10 slots that fit the AT-ST model, the floor tiles, cards, markers and game tokens. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldherr.net/afda085bo-85-mm-3-35-inches-foam-tray-for-star-wars-imperial-assault-board-game-box/a-54752/&quot;&gt;AFDA085BO&lt;/a&gt; contains 36 slots and fits the rebel heroes and the smaller imperial miniatures (Stormtroopers, drones, Darth Vader, nexu, etc.). All of the game minis fit securely into the foam cutouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imperialassault/tray2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Feldherr Tray 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldherr.net/af050ia11-50-mm-2-inches-foam-tray-for-star-wars-imperial-assault-return-to-hoth-board-game-box/a-56512/&quot;&gt;AF050IA11&lt;/a&gt; to organize the larger &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2n3tpJM&quot;&gt;Return to Hoth&lt;/a&gt; expansion. This foam tray costs 10.49 € or about $14. The 22 different sized slots are suitable for all conceivable game materials and houses everything neatly. Finally, I used two sets of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feldherr.net/as035ia12-35-1-38-inches-mm-foam-tray-for-the-star-wars-imperial-assault-the-bespin-gambit-board-game-box/a-56978/&quot;&gt;AS035IA12&lt;/a&gt; to organize the two smaller expansions: &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mttfyG&quot;&gt;Bespin Gambit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mUCBAV&quot;&gt;Twin Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. These trays cost 7.79 € or about $11 and are well worth the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imperialassault/tray3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Feldherr Tray 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feldherr offers various foam inserts for a number of games (Space Hulk, Star Wars: Destiny, Star Wars: Armada, Arcadia Quest, Conan, Descent, Doom, Super Dungeon Explore, and many more!). And although Feldherr has not yet released a foam tray set for &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lPJHWm&quot;&gt;Jabba’s Realm&lt;/a&gt;, Fantasy Flight’s latest boxed expansion for Star Wars: Imperial Assault, it appears that one is likely to be scheduled for release soon. I am a big fan and will certainly be keeping an eye out for ways to organize and clean up my collection with more of these foam trays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foam trays were provided free for review by Feldherr.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - This Belongs in a Museum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tbiam/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This Belongs in a Museum&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Designer:&lt;/strong&gt; Mike Richie&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publisher:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ratherdashinggames.com/this-belongs-in-a-museum&quot;&gt;Rather Dashing Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2017&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MSRP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://kalmbachhobbystore.com/product/game/704002&quot;&gt;$24.99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Play Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 20-30 min&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ages:&lt;/strong&gt; 10+&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.wix.com/ugd/8b63b7_2e6aed984c6145f78cdf8676ba2515d3.pdf&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; Pending&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not familiar with Rather Dashing Games’ Drawn &amp;amp; Quartered series of tile-laying games of which &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mqGlfA&quot;&gt;Pirates, Ninjas, Robots, &amp;amp; Zombies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mUlhvI&quot;&gt;Graveyards, Ghosts &amp;amp; Haunted Houses&lt;/a&gt; are part of.  This Belongs in a Museum is the 3rd game in the series and shares similar mechanics with the previous two. It has players taking the roles of competing archeologists trying to gain the most renown while avoiding mummies and finding ancient relics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put on your fedora, grab your whip, and be ready to spout some famous one-liners…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-abUtRbUS_U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of This Belongs in a Museum is to connect the most temples of your color back to your home base before the pile of tiles runs out. You can also gain extra points by finding your five artifacts as the board is built and moving your color mummy onto opponents’ colored spaces. Use airports to help link back to your camp, or mountain ranges and oceans to maximize your movement. Players can even use special tile actions to rearrange the way the board as been laid out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup is super quick. Grab an archeologist, their color basecamp tile, and 5 random artifact tiles that match the archeologist’s color. These tiles stay hidden from other players. The stack of board tiles is then shuffled and each player takes 3 into their hand. Once everyone as what they need the Mummy Tomb is placed on the table with everyone’s mummy on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn a player places a tile, optionally uses an action if the tile has one, may move their archeologists up to 3 spaces, collects an artifact (if possible), and draws a new tile. Any mummy can be moved instead of using a tile action. Play continues this way until all the tiles run out, then the game is scored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every space matching an archeologist’s base camp that is attached to their basecamp is worth 1 point. Airports can also remotely attach spaces to a player’s basecamp. An archeologist standing in an area of their own color that isn’t attached to their basecamp can score those spaces, also. Each artifact picked up along the way is worth 3 points each. Lastly, if the player’s mummy in on an area of an opponent’s color, those spaces are scored for the mummy’s owner instead of that color player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever has the most points wins. For the full rules, &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.wix.com/ugd/8b63b7_2e6aed984c6145f78cdf8676ba2515d3.pdf&quot;&gt;check here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also received some promo cards with the game, each with a medallion in each of the player colors. One side shows the medallion whole while the other side shows it shattered. Normally a player can’t move through spaces with a mummy on them. The medallion lets them do so once during gameplay, then is flipped over to the broken side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2EEJ0rLcRzA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Belongs in the Museum is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of cardboard. Cardboard player and mummy characters, cardboard artifacts, cardboard tiles. Everything is chunky, sturdy, and feels like it can stand up to the rigors of play over time. The box insert also fits everything nicely without anything falling out of place when stored on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promo cards I received feel a little thin, but they’re not meant to do much except track if the medallion was used. They’re not meant to be shuffled or excessively handled in any way, so it’s not much of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played This Belongs in a Museum with my 3 oldest kids. It was hit or miss when them, but I enjoyed it. There’s plenty of choices in the game when it comes to laying tiles, moving your archeologist, and whether or not to use a tile’s actions or move your mummy. The mummies can really mess up someone’s plans when used properly. It also really helps that any color mummy can be moved instead of using a tile action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s not the deepest game in the world it certainly packs a lot of game into a small package with a fairly short playing time. With easy-to-learn rules, multiple ways to score points, and multiple ways to block other players from doing the game, it’s a great value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m eager to snag the other two games in the Drawn &amp;amp; Quartered series to see how each plays on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/213882/mole-rats-space&quot;&gt;Mole Rats in Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Leacock is widely known through the boardgame industry for his amazing cooperative games like &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2n2g3gT&quot;&gt;Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mTluPT&quot;&gt;Pandemic Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mTAf5l&quot;&gt;Forbidden Island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mpLW5S&quot;&gt;Forbidden Desert&lt;/a&gt;. Now he’s teamed up with Peaceable Kingdom to create a cooperative family that even the littlest ones can enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also features naked mole rats…in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mole Rats in Space is super simple to learn and play. It’s by no means easy to win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the game is to get the 4 pieces of equipment on the board then get every mole rat to the escape pod. It’s the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to win the game. There are, however, a few ways to &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone loses if a mole rat gets bitten &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; by a snake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone loses if any mole rat gets sucked out into space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone loses if any player has no cards to play on their turn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone loses if a snake makes it into the escape pod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;YIKES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player starts with their mole rat on the corresponding color start space with a Medkit and a single, face up card from the deck. On their turn players play their card then draw a new one before the turn passes to the next player. They must take the mole rat action first and then the snake action, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cards will have you moving only your mole rat. Some cards let you move &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; mole rat. Others let you move &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; mole rats. The snake actions are similar, having you move one or all of a single color, one of any color, or moving one, all, or one of any to the nearest ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings me to ladders and pipes. If a mole rat of a snake lands on a ladder, they move up. If they land on a pipe, down. Some pipes lead out into space. You certainly want to get snakes onto these spaces, but lose immediately if a mole rat ends up in one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last item to talk about. Remember that medkit you start with? You’re probably going to need it. If a mole rat lands on a snake, moves &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; a snake, or if a snake lands on a mole rat, it gets bit and has to move back to start. The medkit is discarded and that mole rat has to work their way through the station again. If that mole rat gets bit again…&lt;em&gt;game over, man. Game over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful management of snakes and planning between the players are needed to collect those items and get the heck out of Dodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peaceable Kingdom is well known not only for their excellent components but their environmentally friendly components. Mole Rats in Space is no exception here. All the cardboard and paper products, including the box, are top notch. The plastic mole rats are awesome, and even have a little backpack you can place the equipment tokens in when they’re picked up. Everything is packaged very professionally and in a way where nothing will tumble around when the game is on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/moleratsinspace/inside.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3D Pieces&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Peaceable Kingdom knows how to package a game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All four of my kids and I have been having a blast with Mole Rats in space. It’s the first Peaceable Kingdom game that even the older kids have requested to play. My 3-year-old son loves it because of the mole rats, space theme, and snakes. The older kids love it because of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clear here. This isn’t your typical Peaceable Kingdom game where the players can win a majority of the time. Mole Rats in Space is &lt;strong&gt;brutal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/perspectivepawn/status/838394513185988608&quot;&gt;Curse you, Matt Leacock!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. While the game is hard it’s still amazingly fun to play, and each time we get a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit closer to winning. Just this morning we finally acquired all four items and were almost to the escape pod before we ran out of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SO&lt;/em&gt; close!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love all the Peaceable Kingdom games in our household, but Mole Rats in Space has quickly rocketed to the top as everyone’s favorite. That’s an impressive feat to sway a 3-year-old who &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; loves to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mpVldK&quot;&gt;Feed the Wooze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Rules Available Online:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/products/ogredesigner/img/ogre_rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;Kind of&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BGG:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5206/ogre&quot;&gt;OGRE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I played OGRE was &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; ago on a paper board with thin, cardboard counters. I drooled over the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/products/ogredesigner/img/ogre_rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;Designer’s Edition&lt;/a&gt; when it came out, but there was no way I could afford it, or find a place to store it! I did end up eventually buying the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/products/pocketogre/&quot;&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt;, a faithful reproduction of the original, a few years back but it ended up getting lost somewhere on my shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then OGRE 6th Edition came along. Beautiful and modern, just like the Designer’s Edition, just…smaller. More manageable. Time to relive my youth and share the experience with my kids. It’s just a shame they won’t let me play as an OGRE…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OGRE is a game of futuristic machines of war. There are many scenarios that you can play, but the very basic has one player controlling an OGRE while the other has a giant force of infantry and heavily armored vehicles. Spoiler: the OGRE usually wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics of the game are very simple. Move all your units, attack, and move GEV units again. Combat is resolved by comparing attack values against defense values, figuring out the odds, rolling a die and consulting a chart. 3 things can happen: nothing, the unit is disabled, the unit is destroyed. In the case of an OGRE, the damage will be ticked off its sheet in the appropriate area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. OGRES are a beast. They’ve got several weapons to deal with, along with their treads. Taking out an OGRE’s treads early can slow them down. It’s not always enough, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full rules cover terrain, ramming, combining units, and more. You can take a look at the Designer Edition’s rules &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/products/ogredesigner/img/ogre_rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. They’re pretty much the rules you get in the box with OGRE 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OGRE 6th Edition is certainly a deluxe version compared to its roots, it still very much captures the feel of its ancestor. The board, while large and full-color, is still laid out in the same manner with minimal decoration. All the units are still cardboard counters, just larger to fit into the larger hexes on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where OGRE 6th really shines is the OGREs, themselves. These are 3D cardboard models that you assemble, and they’re pretty damn big and impressive. There’s also two command bases that are 3D as well, but it’s just a nice touch, nothing as impressive as the massive, rolling, death machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I don’t talk much about the boxes games come in, but OGRE’s box is a lesson in utility. It contains compartments for the fully assembled OGREs, as well as extra compartments for dice, terrain, units, and expansion material. The board fits in snugly over this to keep everything in its place without spilling out when you turn the box sideways. Thanks, SJG!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ogre/3d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3D Pieces&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Such wonderful cardboard of death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it all play? Just like I remember. I know the rules have been massaged and tweaked, but nothing feels like it’s so different that it’s not the same game I played back in the days of paper maps and small cardboard chits. The design itself holds up extremely well, and I had a blast giving the game a shot with my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, they never let me play as the OGRE. I need to look at some scenarios where it’s OGRE against OGRE or else I’m never going to have a chance at winning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re an OGRE fan that missed out on the Designer’s Edition for one reason or another, this is the edition you’re going to want to grab. If you’ve never played OGRE, give it a shot! You may not want to spend the $50 on this edition, but $3 on the Pocket Edition will get you into the game and give you a good feel if you’re ready for some massive, 3D OGRE action.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - SkullSplitter Warlock Tome with Smoke and Fire Metal Dice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A short while ago I saw a Facebook ad for SkullSplitter dice. Intrigued, I clicked on the link (a rarity for me!) and was brought to SkullSplitter’s site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Jaw hit the floor]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such beautiful dice &lt;strong&gt;made of metal&lt;/strong&gt;! I immediately wrote them asking if they’d be interested in shooting over a set for review. They happily agreed, and after a short back and forth about details I received the following email (images of my dice inserted in place of my order details):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Rob,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A messenger has just come down from the surface with news of your purchase. His beard smelled of rain and wind. Long has it been since I’ve been outside the belly of this mountain. Don’t misunderstand…complain I do not. This rock, these walls, this forge, these tools… these are those from which legend is crafted. You have chosen well, human! The fires from which thine dice shall be born burn hot today. My energy is well-fed on seed-cake and the waters of underground streams. Dawdle I shall not, but instead to the forges! From out of the flames, malleable metals to be shaped into poly-sided dice. I will engrave with great care each numeric symbol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In short time I will be finished and then you can expect them to be shipped according to the details below:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/skullsplitter/box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SkullSplitter Warlock Tome with Smoke and Fire Metal Dice Tin&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/skullsplitter/back.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SkullSplitter Warlock Tome with Smoke and Fire Metal Dice Tin Back&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/skullsplitter/open.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SkullSplitter Warlock Tome with Smoke and Fire Metal Dice Tin Inside&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/skullsplitter/dice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SkullSplitter Warlock Tome with Smoke and Fire Metal Dice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let us hope that I don’t decide to hoard them for myself. Ha, I jest, human! I will send them on to you, as you have been given my word. I can only imagine your anticipation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But enough with words. To work, to work … always to glorious work. In the meantime, contact my messenger if you have any questions. He has given me this cryptic means of communication, some wizardry called e-mail (Elvish mail, I’m guessing): CustomerLove@Skullsplitter.co.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Andrar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dwarvish Dice-smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;02/28/2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty awesome, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the dice actually just arrived today and I couldn’t wait to open them up and write this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Warlock Tome tin as a bit larger and sturdier than an Altoid tin and contains foam cutouts for each die to sit in. There’s also a bit of padding in the lid of the tin so the dice can’t damage the metal. The dice themselves? Amazing. They have a wonderful heft to them and the Smoke and Fire coloring work wonderfully together to create a really striking dice. The dice themselves are not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; black with a vivid red for the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that really struck me is how &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt; they are when rolling on a hard surface. These really are heavy dice and could probably do some major damage to a scratchable/breakable surface. I’d recommend rolling them in a tray or dropping them down a dice tower. Speaking of dice towers, these dice sound wonderful tumbling down my Wyrmwood tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SkullSplitter’s sets that come in the tins range from $35-$40. This may seem a bit pricey but these are dice made to last a lifetime and a certainly a luxury item to treasure until your dying breath. You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skullsplitterdice.com/collections/dwarven-chest&quot;&gt;purchase&lt;/a&gt; sets without tins, smaller sets of certain types of dice, or single dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SkullSplitter dice are flat out amazing. Are they for everyone? No way. Are they for the dice-chucking, game fanatics in your life? Yes. These are certainly dice that will accent any gaming setup no matter how big or small.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Micro Review - Moop's Monster Mashup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/munchkin/moop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Moop's Monster Mashup&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like you need an Owligator or Kangarooster in your game of Munchkin? How about a Beaver Cleaver or the ability to strip your opponents Bear Naked. Moop’s Monster Mashup has you covered in one of the craziest Munchkins yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole reason this is a Micro Review and not a standard review is that Moop’s Monster Mashup is just Munchkin with a bit of a different theme and different art. It’s a stand-alone set, so you don’t need any other Munchkin products to play, but like all other Munchkin games it can be combined with other sets to make an even crazier game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kick down the door. Kill the monsters. Backstab your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First to Level 10 wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like Ian McGinty’s art in Moop’s Monster Mashup. It’s a bit more cartoony, colorful, and pops right of the cards. The style certainly fits to zany nature of the theme. There’s not much more to say about it. Other than the artwork, it’s a standard Munchkin game with your standard Munchkin quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids are Munchkin fanatics, especially my 11-year-old-son. It’s the only reason I started playing Munchkin once again after years moving on from the game. Seriously, though, it’s a blast playing it with them. We’ve got the Deluxe version at home with a handful of the numbered expansions and Adventure Time Munchkin. While Adventure Time is still my favorite set so far, Moop’s comes in a very close second. Just the sheer insanity of some of the cards and their names was enough to make me laugh at out on several occasions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t already have Munchkin and aren’t in the mood for a licensed theme, Moop’s is probably the set you should get. It’s a step up from the “classic” Munchkin in terms of wacky cards and artwork. There’s not a Deluxe version, so you won’t get a board. That’s about the only downside I can see to this set.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Alwa's Awakening</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/alwasawakening/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alwa's Awakening Cover&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually found Alwa’s Awakening while requesting a review key for another game about a month or so ago. I was immediately drawn by two things: the art direction and the tag “Metroidvania” attached to the game’s description. Intrigued, I requested a key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down the rabbit hole, I went into a nostalgic ecstasy of exploration, platforming, and amazing craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alwa’s Awakening plays like your standard Metroidvania. You are free to explore the world but can only access more areas once you’ve acquired certain upgrades. The game doesn’t have some of the usual tropes like double jumps, etc… Instead, you get upgrades to Zoe, the main character’s, staff. The first of which allows you to create a moveable block that lets you access higher areas, cross longer sections of spikes, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controls are simple, smooth, and familiar to anyone who grew up during the NES era. Really the only controls you have for Zoe are movement, jumping, attacking, and activating spells. Everything could be controlled with an old-school, two-button NES controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I feel I should mention is that Alwa’s Awakening awards smart play and planning out your routes. How does it award you? Survival. The game keeps a count of how many times you die. Play well, that number stays low. Try and rush things and you’ll rack up a body count like no one’s business. The beginning of the game lulls you into a false sense of security, then things progress in difficulty rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some games go for the retro look with some modern tweaks, Alwa’s Awakening goes whole hog in faithfully recreating what an old-school, 8-bit game looks, feels, and sounds like. Sprites are pure 8-bit pixel art and the chiptune soundtrack sounds like it could have come straight from the 80’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention that the soundtrack is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a lot of crap chiptune out there, but Alwa’s Awakening has none of that nonsense. The soundtrack is well thought out and really blends with the whole experience of playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a game that would have felt right at home in the 80’s, and that’s one of the biggest compliments I can give it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/alwasawakening/screens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Such beautiful pixel art&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long before a smile had crept across my face when first playing Alwa’s Awakening. I found myself sitting in front of my laptop grinning like an idiot as I explored the world of Alwa with Zoe and her magic wand. While the story is nothing to write home about, the gameplay is where it’s at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the game gets &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder as you go on. Yes, some of the boss fights are actually a bit too easy compared to the puzzles and platforming. Yes, the game is still amazing. The game reminds me a lot of Castlevania II and that high praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound awesome to you? Got you drooling a bit for a bit of a throwback? It’s only $10 on Steam, so snag it now and enjoy a bit of what gaming used to be like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Board Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have fond memories of watching Bill &amp;amp; Ted’s excellent adventure when I was 8. Their antics have stuck with me all the way to adulthood, and I’m still a fan to this day. Strange things are afoot at the Circle-K, and this time it’s an excellent Bill &amp;amp; Ted board game by Steve Jackson Games. It arrived last week and the kids and I have already taken a go at it, so I’d better get pictures taken while I still can! Without further ado I give you Bill S. Preston, Esquire and Ted “Theodore” Logan’s Excellent Boardgame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be excellent to each other. Party on, dudes!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;ThinkGeek has released a new edition of its classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/aaa5/?pfm=HP_TopCMD_aaa5&quot;&gt;Bag of Holding&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve owned a Bag of Holding since they were first released and it’s the best bag I’ve ever owned. Now it’s showing its age a bit and it looks like the perfect time to upgrade has come along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new bag is a bit larger with a few more ammenities than its predecessor including a padded shoulder strap and a printed lining featuring hand-drawn gems, potions, shields, keys, d20s, and swords.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Fallen Angel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You may remember quite some time ago I backed &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Fallen-Angel-Kickstarter/&quot;&gt;Fallen Angel&lt;/a&gt; on Kickstarter. My copy arrived a few weeks ago and I had meant to posts some pictures, but there was a small problem. The box was pretty banged up. Thankfully all the components where safe but the box had seen better days. I was supposed to get a new box from the company and it hasn’t arrived yet. Feeling pretty frustrated, I decided to just go ahead and post the pictures and try to keep most of the box damage as hidden as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Mole Rats in Space</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Readers of both this site and Purple Pawn probably know that my family is a huge fan of Peaceable Kingdom games, so when they approached me asking if I wanted to review their new title from Matt Leacock, Mole Rats in Space, I couldn’t have give them a more enthusiastic “Yes.” The game arrived late last week and we’ve already played it a handful of times. I figured I should get some pics of the game while it’s relatively pristine. My 3-year-old son has a habit of being rough on cards.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King Coming March 28th</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hitting Steam on March 28th, Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King is a vast open game world in classic action-adventure fashion. Play as Lily, Knight of the Rose, in a fantastic top-down action-RPG in the same vein as A Link to the Past. Slash your way through monster-infested dungeons to save the Kingdom of Blossom from eternal darkness. The game is developed by Castle Pixel and published by FDG Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect unique weapons, spells, and more during your journey to take down powerful bosses and solve clever puzzles. Enjoy a vivid, dynamic story passed down from grandfather to grandchildren by influencing the course of events yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Pixel describes Blossom Tales as “A delightful mix of ‘Zelda’ and ‘Princess Bride’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this sounds as awesome to you as it does to me, keep an eye on the game’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/446810&quot;&gt;Steam page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Mint Works</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/mintworks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mint Works&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in August, I had posted about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Mint-Works-Kickstarter/&quot;&gt;Mint Works Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. For just $10 I secured myself a copy of the game once it was released. Well, that time has come and gone and I recently received my copy of the game. Considering it’s such a short game, it didn’t take it long to hit the table since we could easily squeeze it in even one of our busiest nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the unfamiliar, Mint works is a pocket-sized, light worker placement game for 1-4 players that fits in a mint tin. It plays ultra quick and is a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mint Works plays very fast and is simple to grasp once you get past the rather vague rulebook (more on this later). Each player as a limited amount of Mint Tokens to use to earn more tokens, buy plans, build plans, or take the First Player token. Building plans is how you earn points in the game, and once a player has earned 7 points the end of the game is triggered and the round continues. At the end of the last round, the player with the most points wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if that were all it wouldn’t be very exciting, would it? As with any worker placement game, your actions are going to me limited by your current resources and the point in the round you take your action. Also, plans you build might have a power you can use to further help you along your merry way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that there’s a solo variant with four different AI opponents to play against. Rules are similar, with each AI have preprogrammed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about Mint Works is it really does come in a mint tin! Inside is the rulebook, cards, and wooden mint tokens. Everything is high quality, but it took a bit of working to get everything &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the tin the first time I opened the game. I ended up needing to clip the corners of the rulebook a bit for a better fit. I had no issues with the cards or tokens, and everything packs back up nicely now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mint Works is an excellent little game, and for the price, you really can’t go wrong. Even though it’s fast and easy to learn, it’s a bit more than a filler game as there are enough choices and optional cards to really step the game up to a higher level. So far I’ve only played with my 11-year-old son, but I’m planning to get some games in with my 6 year old and 9 year old soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; complaint. The rules are bit vague and I wasn’t able to fully figure out how to properly play the game with them alone. I ended up having to watch Rahdo’s walkthrough video (below), which laid everything out and made things &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more clear. After that, I was able to use the rules as a good reference and was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4SvFMlBahY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the final game is $12 (not the $10 it was through KS) it’s still a great value in an amazingly small package. I now keep Mint Works in my bag so I can take it with me wherever I go. The metal tin keeps it safe and contains a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can highly recommend the game, and am really glad I backed it on Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hot Toys Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Rocket Raccoon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“He says welcome to the frickin’ Guardians of the Galaxy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot Toys has just announced their Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 Rocket Raccoon (with baby Groot) figure. Available for pre-order now, this $200 figure comes with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hottoys.com.hk/productDetail.php?productID=464&quot;&gt;ton of stuff&lt;/a&gt;, including 2 weapons, 8 interchangeable hands, 2 costumes, 3 accessories (1 being Baby Groot in a Reaver outfit), and at least 2 heads. He’s sixth scale, which comes out to 6.29” tall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deluxe Rocket is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sideshowtoy.com/collectibles/marvel-rocket-deluxe-version-hot-toys-902965/&quot;&gt;available for pre-order&lt;/a&gt; through Sideshow Collectibles for $227.99. While he’s pricey, man would I love to get my hands on him. I’ve got the perfect spot in my cube at work for a gun-toting raccoon with the universe’s largest attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview - Ruin of the Reckless</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ruinofthereckless/titleScrollGreenLight.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Ruin of the Reckless&quot; /&gt;
Faux-Operative Games had a successful Kickstarter campaign for Ruin of the Reckless, a pixel-art, fast paced, action rogue-like that focuses on melee combat and twitch reflexes. I was lucky enough to get an early build of the game to put through its paces and to see how it’s coming along. It’s quickly become one of my favorite games of the year so far, even with its brutal difficulty and my many, many deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruin of the Reckless doesn’t give you much to go on story-wise when you first start. You’re dead, and your soul has been sent to the tower for eternity. Of course, if you can make it to the top of the tower there’s a possibility of having a wish granted. With that, you’re led through a brief tutorial on movement and combat before being let loose into the hell that is the tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics of the game are that your movement and aim are both independent of each other. You can dash, cast spells, equip skill orbs up to a level limit, and drink potions/use one-off items. As you progress through the tower you earn money you can use at checkpoints to purchase new weapons, boots, spells, orbs, and one-offs. There’s also cards you can earn that can be activated to permanently effect the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention Ruin of the Reckless is hard? The game wastes no time is having waves of enemies swarm you over and over again. On top of that, each randomly generated level has a time level before the level becomes unstable and starts to rapidly drop stuff on your head. If you die, you start over at the last checkpoint. There’s also a helpful character that will tell you how many times you died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup. He’s become my best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruin if the Reckless is already feeling like a finished game and a damn good one at that. Faux-Operative Games has a real winner on their hands. Not only has the game been Kickstarted, but it’s also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=683031395&quot;&gt;Greenlit on Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Batman: The Animated Series Dice Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/batmantasdice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Batman Dice Logo&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batman: The Animated series is the definitive Batman in my book. It aired when I was just 11 years old and it couldn’t have been any more perfect in my mind. Even going back and watching it as an adult with my kids, it’s a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Steve Jackson Games released Batman: The Animated Dice Game. Sure it’s going to be light on theme, but it’s still Batman: TaS! It didn’t take long for me to cut open the blister pack and get playing with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batman: The Animated Series Dice Game is a rethemed version of Steve Jackon Games’ earlier title, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lOG9nY&quot;&gt;Zombie Dice&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve played that, you’ve played this. This one also has variable player powers in the form of 4 villain tokens: The Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every turn the current player shakes up all the dice in the cup and randomly draws 3, rolls them, and follows the following rules for results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loot:&lt;/strong&gt; Set aside for points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarms:&lt;/strong&gt; Leave on table to be rerolled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batman:&lt;/strong&gt; Set aside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at any point there are 3 or more Batman symbols on the table the current player is busted, loses all the current points earned, and play passes to the next player. If there’s not 3 Batman symbols on the table players can choose to keep drawing up to 3 dice, this includes any Alarms on the table and can keep rolling for more points, or to stop and earn whatever points they rolled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their turn players can use their villain power to gain a bit of an edge. The Joker scores an extra point, even if busted, as long as there’s one of each color dice on the table. Poison Ivy can discard one blue Batman symbol once per turn. Catwoman scores double on blue Loot icons if she completes a heist. Riddler rolls four dice instead of three on his first roll each turn. He may then return any or all of them to the cup. He rolls three dice as usual on later rolls. (If he gets four Alarms on his first roll, he may re-roll all of them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first player to reach 30 points wins signals the end of the game and the current round finishes up. The player with the most Loot at the end of the game wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batman: The Animated Series Dice Game is clearly made for retail and as such comes in some pretty sturdy packaging, a blister pack with the dice clearly shown and the dice cup placed behind an illustrated covering. Once open the engraved dice, rules, and cardboard villain tokens can all be stored in the dice cup and sealed with a recessed lid. Everything packs up to be slightly smaller than a soda can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for any kind of depth or real theme, Batman: The Animated Series Dice Game isn’t going to be for you. This is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; light dice game with a Batman: TaS theme tacked on top of it. Does that make it any less enjoyable? For me and my kids, no. The game takes about five minutes to play and can seriously feed the urge to chuck some dice without too much thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s purely a push-your-luck game. &lt;em&gt;With Batman&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also only $15, the perfect price point to snag at your local toy store to give as a gift to the Batman lover in your life (including yourself.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After teaching my kids to play this one they’ve taken it off the shelf multiple times to play and have even tried teaching their 3-year-old little brother to play. It’s portable and rugged, so I know I can take it places to help keep them busy in situations where we need to go out and there may be some waiting involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That alone is a win for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Batman: The Animated Series Dice Game was provided for review by Steve Jackson Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Graveyard Keeper Announced by tinyBuild</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lazy Bear Games, of Punch Club fame, and tinyBuild have just announced Graveyard Keeper, the most inaccurate medieval cemetery management sim of the year. The game has you managing a medieval cemetery while cutting as many corners as you can to save time and money. It also lets you expand your business past corpse disposal into other areas like entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beef cost too much for your excellent fair burgers? Look at all that “fresh” meat you have laying around the cemetary! There’ll also be a crafting system, dungeons to explore, and dead bodies to exploit for their parts and blood!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graveyard Keeper drops this year for PC and Xbox One. It’ll be on the PAX East floor, too, so I’m hoping to get a good look at it while I’m there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Villages of Valeria</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/villagesofvaleria2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Villages of Valeria&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot where I heard about Villages of Valeria, but I can tell you I almost missed it. I seriously almost never knew it existed. I can tell you right now that would have been a damn shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Villages of Valeria is set in the same world as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymagicgames.com/valeria-card-kingdoms&quot;&gt;Valeria: Card Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, but takes place &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; before the hordes of monsters attack. Players take the role of Barons constructing cities, each hoping to become the capital of Valeria by building the greatest buildings and attracting the best heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the game, every player gets a hand of 6 cards and a certain amount of gold depending on the number of players. Each player also has their castle played in front of them, which can provide a wild resource throughout the game. The Building and Adventurer decks are shuffled, and 5 of each type of card are put down as the current market. Every player then takes one card from their hand and places it with their castle as a resource for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably a good time to mention that Buildings can be built or flipped upside down to be used as a resource, which is needed to build more buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first player takes the Active Player token and takes one of the following actions, with the other players having the option of taking the Follow Action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARVEST:&lt;/strong&gt; Draw 3 Cards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Follow:&lt;/strong&gt; Draw 1 Card.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEVELOP:&lt;/strong&gt; Discard 1 card to add a Card to your Castle as a Resource. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Follow:&lt;/strong&gt; You may discard 2 cards to add a Card to your Castle as a Resource.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUILD:&lt;/strong&gt; Place Gold on Resources to add a building to your village and draw 1 card. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Follow:&lt;/strong&gt; You may place Gold on Resources to add a building to your village.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECRUIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Pay 1 Gold to add an Adventurer to your village.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Follow:&lt;/strong&gt; Pay 2 Gold to add an Adventurer to your village.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAX:&lt;/strong&gt; Collect 1 Gold and draw 1 Card.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Follow:&lt;/strong&gt; Draw 1 Card.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play then continues with the next player taking the Active Player token and choosing an action, and so on. The game ends when a number of buildings, depending on the number of players, is built. Victory points are then added up and the winner declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the full rules, check out the video below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dN7XCM0d4V8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Villages of Valeria is mostly cards and those of high quality. The artwork on them is both colorful and beautiful. I’m especially fond of all the different, quirky adventurers. The wooden tokens, the Active Player token and gold pieces, go above and beyond by not only being wooden but also having painted detail on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/villagesofvaleria/tokens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wooden tokens&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Wonderfully detailed, wooden pieces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 3 oldest kids and I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; Villages of Valeria. The combination of managing resources, choosing what action to take during a round, choosing if you’re going to take a &lt;em&gt;Follow&lt;/em&gt; actions during another player’s turn, and choosing when to snag the right adventure just felt so perfectly balanced and streamlined. Never once during play did anything feel the least big clunky or out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a game just hits all the right buttons. Between the size of the game, the colorful artwork, simple rules, and excellent gameplay, Villages of Valeria is one of those games that I feel will be played by my family for years to come. With the sheer amount of games coming through the door, it’s rare for a game to really strike such a cord with us that I can say with certainty that it’s one that will stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Villages of Valeria for you? I’d love to say it is, but of everyone has their own likes/dislikes. If you’ve read the above and are at least mildly interested, I’d give it a try. At $25 and with a play time of around 30-60 minutes, it’s worth taking a chance. I think you’ll love it, and hope you love is as much as I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Villages of Valeria was provided for review by Daily Magic Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing This Belongs in a Museum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather Dashing Games will soon be releasing This Belongs in a Museum, the 3rd game in their Drawn &amp;amp; Quartered series. It’s actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ratherdashinggames.com/this-belongs-in-a-museum&quot;&gt;available for pre-order&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They recently sent me the game, and while I haven’t played it yet I was just able to snag some pictures of the contents and extra cards Rather Dashing sent over. I haven’t played any of the previous Drawn &amp;amp; Quartered series games, so I have no idea what to expect. Looks pretty cool, though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first seven images are what comes in the box. The last two were in a ziplock baggie. I’m guessing a promotion or expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Unboxing Pokémon TCG Sun &amp; Moon</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fsYx5APt4ck&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company recently sent me some cards from the new Sun &amp;amp; Moon set: 1 of each of the three new Theme Decks and 4 booster packs. Of course my kids eagerly divvied up the loot and eagerly unwrapped everything. This is to be expected in our household. Dad asks only one thing: save the code cards for him. I then use those code cards to import the packs and Theme Decks into the Pokémon TCG Online client. The result of which is what you see above. A digital unboxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had a chance to play with any of the new cards yet, but there’s some great looking ones in there. The Incineroar GX is particularly nice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Celebrate Pokémon Day on February 27</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemon/pokemonday.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pokémon Day&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokémon Day is coming up on February 27th and The Pokémon Company has a lot going on to celebrate! Here’s the list of specials and events from the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pikachu will lead the Pokémon Day celebration in Pokémon GO. From February 26, 1:00 pm PST, to March 6, 1:00pm PST, any Pikachu encountered in the wild will be wearing a festive party hat! The Pikachu caught during that time will keep its party hat, so be sure to look for this special Pikachu during its short time in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pokémon Day marks the debut of the new Gallery Figures collection in the Pokémon Center. The first set includes awesome figures of Eevee, Mew, Magikarp, and Pikachu—each performing its signature attack. These figures were designed specifically for the Pokémon Center, so this is the first time anyone will be able to get their hands on them. Check out the Pokémon Gallery Figures collection in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/&quot;&gt;Pokémon Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting on Pokémon Day, revisit some of the best big-screen moments of Ash and his friends with a movie marathon on Pokémon TV. For a limited time, watch the original classic Pokémon: The First Movie, as well as Pokémon 4Ever and Pokémon—Zoroark: Master of Illusions in their entirety. Remember that you can watch Pokémon TV on Pokemon.com and on the Pokémon TV mobile apps on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pokemon-tv/id594261405?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pokemontv&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;. These movies will be available for only a limited time, so don’t miss them!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Trading Card Game Online is starting its Pokémon Day festivities early, with extra Trainer Tokens available on the Bonus Wheel for the entire week leading up to Pokémon Day. Then, be sure to log in to your game on Pokémon Day for an extra-special Daily Bonus. Remember that you can play the Pokémon TCG Online on your computer, iPad, or Android tablet. Battle today and through Pokémon Day for bigger rewards!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget that right now you can head to your local participating GameStop store to get a Bottle Cap for your Pokémon Sun or Pokémon Moon video game. This item lets you boost the individual strength of one of your Pokémon’s stats via Hyper Training, making the Pokémon even more ready for your next big battle! Bottle Cap codes will be available at GameStop until March 5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pikachu lends its brilliant features to the new Pikachu Yellow Edition New Nintendo 3DS XL. This limited-edition New Nintendo 3DS XL is launching just a couple of days before Pokémon Day, and it’s sure to be popular, so check it out while you can. Visit the product page on Nintendo.com for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for even more Pokémon animation fun for your Pokémon Day celebrations, you can find Pokémon the Movie: Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel on the iTunes Store, Google Play, and Amazon Video. Plus, check out a special Pokémon the Series: Gold &amp;amp; Silver TV episode bundle featuring Ash’s adventures throughout the Johto region. With this collection of episodes and the latest Pokémon movie, you’ll be ready to host the perfect Pokémon Day party!

  &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Cards Against Humanity and BioWare Release Mass Effect Pack for $1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read the title of this post, you understand what’s going on here. Cards Against Humanity has teamed up with BioWare to create a small pack of 14 Mass Effect cards for everyone’s favorite adult party game. You can snag the cards from &lt;a href=&quot;https://totallyfuckablealiens.com/&quot;&gt;totallyfuckablealiens.com&lt;/a&gt; for $1 (that includes shipping.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may feel like some cards are missing from this set. That’s because they’ll be sold later as DLC. Way to follow through on a theme CAH.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Slime-san Announced from Fabraz and Headup Games</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-kHf02eAvn4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headup Games and Fabraz have announced their upcoming action-platformer &lt;a href=&quot;http://slime-san.com/&quot;&gt;Slime-san&lt;/a&gt; for PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam &amp;amp; Humble Bundle. Console releases will follow shortly after. Slime-san will feature 100 levels of twitch-timing, platforming action with different play styles, mini-games, and a shop to buy cool new stuff (using in-game currency earned, not microtransactions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing the game for a bit now, and am really enjoying it. It has a Super Meat Boy kind of feel with its own unique visual style and an amazing chiptune soundtrack. I should have a full review of the game going up in the next few weeks, so keep an eye out for that!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Battle Princess Madelyn Set to Come Out of Greenlight</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gHOYSLPZGmk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causal Bit Games is gearing up for their game, Battle Princess Madelyn, to leave Greenlight and set to release on PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U and Nintendo Switch. Similar to games like Ghouls N’ Ghosts and Wonder Boy 3: The Dragon’s Trap, the game will include ten levels which each have five stages, some hidden. Unlockable weapons, hidden secrets, and gameplay that both the novice and hardcore gamer can appricate are what await in Battle Princess Madelyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Creative Director Christopher Obritsch daughter Madelyn wanted to be in Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, and fight “Green Head”, he said it was someone else’s game - but he could make her one that was like it. “But girls can’t be knights, Daddy. Only boys…” she said, to which he answered “Pshh…What color do you want your armor to be?”. The answer? Pink! And that’s how this game started. Chris’ daughter Madelyn loves the first stage of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts and makes him play it over and over because she wants to see him fight “Green Head”, the Shielder boss at the end of the first stage. It’s not hard for her to twist his rubber arm, as it’s been his favorite game since it came out all those years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Old School gameplay and presentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a mixture of gameplay styles all merge to become one polished offering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Utilization of the Unity engine that brings a new edge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Special weapons for special occasions - including combos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to get some hands-on time with this one at PAX East. I’m also hoping a review code will head in my direction!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing OGRE 6th Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Jackson’s OGRE is a classic wargame that has stood the test of time. There’s been a few modern releases, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lCV9Hz&quot;&gt;OGRE Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt; which was a faithful reproduction of the original, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2kIyEBF&quot;&gt;OGRE Designer’s Edition&lt;/a&gt;, a recording breaking Kickstarter release that was &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; in scale. Now Steve Jackson Games has released &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lD333Q&quot;&gt;OGRE 6th Edition&lt;/a&gt;, a version that captures the quality of the Designer’s Edition but makes it a bit more manageable both in size and price.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hexpanse Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/hexpanse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hexpanse&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
I’ve been interested in Hexpanse since I first laid my eyes on Korona Games’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1385946864/hexpanse&quot;&gt;Kickstarter project&lt;/a&gt; for the game. Here was a game that claimed to be an abstract strategy game, but looked to be oozing with a sci-fi theme. I immediately wrote to Korona asking if they’d be interested in letting me preview the game. A few weeks later a prototype arrived on my doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me just take an aside here to say this wasn’t your normal Kickstarter prototype. The prototype version of Hexpanse I received is very high quality. Much higher than anything I would have expected. Is it good enough to sell on store shelves? No, but it’s close!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, there’s a lot of cards, tokens, board, etc… that it seemed a bit daunting. I was expecting a rule book chock full text and a game that would take almost as long to setup as it did to play. The picture below shows you what a full compliment of four players would look like set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hexpanse/layout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hexpanse Layout&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Hexpanse layout with a full compliment of players&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rulebook, while 18 pages long, really only contains about 4-5 pages of actual, illustrated rules. The rest is icon reference and a full reference to every card in the game. The actual meat of the game is surprisingly easy to learn, and setting up the game is actually pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player takes control of a Faction, its Warlord, units, and optionally a Minor Faction’s units. The goal of Hexpanse is to get your units on the board in a way that matches the pattern on a Mission Card drawn during the setup of the game. You can also win by annihilating the other players’ Warlords, but that’s a much rarer occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game immediately takes off as players race to get units on the board, prevent opponent units from getting into formation, trying to earn enough money to buys Action Cards and Mercenaries from the Market, and actually using those cards to help achieve the ultimate goal of matching the Mission’s pattern. Each Warlord also has its own special action that can be performed, while Minor Faction units each have their own special actions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player’s turn consists of 3 phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income Phase - Replenishing currency by the number of their income level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Action Phase - Taking 2 actions from the following list:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Place a Unit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Move a Unit back to Reserve&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Attack&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Move a unit from Recovery to Reserve&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Play an Action Card&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activate a Mercenary Card&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gain 1 currency&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Increase Income Level by paying the next level’s number + 1&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Play one of three Warlord Actions (once per turn)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Heal Warlord by 1&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Move Warlord to an adjacent space&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use your Warlord’s special ability&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Market Phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game immediately ends when a player completes the Mission or there are no other Warlords on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said early, Hexpanse moves fast, lasting only 30-45 minutes. Every action taken is agonizing as there are at least 3-4 other actions you’ll be wanting to take at the same time. Your choices matter very much, and one wrong move could easily spend the end of the game for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed Hexpanse and I can’t say I thought I would after digging through the box. The game turned out to be much simpler to learn, and quicker to setup than I initially thought. There’s also a surprising amount of depth considering the simplicity of the rules and the short length of the actual play time. My only complaint is the player-elimination aspect of the game. If a player’s Warlord is eliminated early, that means that player is immediately out of the game. It’s only a small concern, as it’s not that easy to take a player out while still racing to get your units in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Hexpance is a clever strategy game with an excellent price tag ($45.) While the Kickstarter campaign is over, you can still late pledge to make sure you receive of copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Hexpanse prototype was provided free for this preview by Korona Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Broken Egg Games' Imperial Assault Tokens</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/brokeneggtokens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Imperial Assault Tokens&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
One great way to kick a game of Star Wars Imperial Assault or Star Wars: Destiny up a notch is through customization. It is truly awesome how something as small as a token or a door placed on the board can revolutionize your game’s aesthetics. Currently, there are a lot of great outfits with a lot of great custom pieces on the market. Recently, I got my hands on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brokenegggames.com/destiny-token-sets.html&quot;&gt;this set of custom tokens&lt;/a&gt; produced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brokenegggames.com/&quot;&gt;Broken Egg Games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set comes with 35 fully-printed double-sided tokens printed with a high UV Color layer directly onto acrylic, with each side bearing a Hero or Villain faction color scheme. Here is what you will get in your 35-token set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 1-Damage Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 3-Damage Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 Shields/Armor Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 Supplies/Crates Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tokens are crystal clear and the images are crisp and sharp. Each token has a nice weight and thickness and they really jump off the board. The damage counters look stunning next to your deck or character card. I was particularly impressed by the crate tokens. What a great way to upgrade and enhance a game. Their shape and imaging gives them an almost three-dimensional appearance. Although they have a delicate quality to them, what table-top game piece doesn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/imperialassault/brokeneggtokens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Broken Egg Tokens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I begin a new campaign of Imperial Assault with some friends and these will make a nice addition. I am very impressed with the quality of these tokens and would highly recommend them. And, at $25, it is one of the cheaper custom token sets on the market, this buy is definitely a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hasbro Unveiling Transformers Trypticon at New York Toy Fair 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015 Hasbro gave fans the option to vote for their favorite character to become the next Generations Titans Return Titan Class toy. The ballots were counted and fans voted on Trypticon! Now, coming in the fall, Trypticon is the largest figure in the 2017 Titans Return universe and is also the biggest Decepticon figure ever made. It converts between three different modes: dino, spaceship and city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the figure is in city mode, it connects to Titans Return Leader Class figures to form the giant Nemesis Command. When the figure is in T-Rex mode, it can “eat” Titan Master figures: he can chomp them down, then you can open his stomach to get them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trypticon comes with a Deluxe Class Full-Tilt figure and a Titan Master Decepticon Necro figure. The Full-Tilt figure attaches to the Trypticon figure’s chest. The Titan Master figure becomes the head for the Full-Tilt figure and works with all Titans Return Deluxe, Voyager, and Leader Class figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visitors to NY Toy Fair this coming weekend will be able to get the first up close and personal look at the new figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trypticon will be available this fall for $149.99.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>McFarlane Toys &amp; Bungie Team Up to Make Destiny Figures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mcfarlane/destiny.png&quot; alt=&quot;McFarlane/Bungie Destiny&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McFarlane Toys is proud to announce that it is once again partnering with Bungie – this time to create Guardian action figures for Destiny, scheduled for release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McFarlane Toys’ initial set of Destiny toys will be fully articulated figures that depict  the Guardian Classes. Each will have a windowed collector box and will come with a Destiny branded base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Detail, depth, and customization, that’s what Destiny gives its players, and that’s what made it the biggest new video game franchise launch,”&lt;/em&gt; said Todd McFarlane, Owner and CEO of McFarlane Toys. &lt;em&gt;“With our upcoming Destiny line, fans can expect that same amount of detail and customization that we have built our own reputation on.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can expect to see the Destiny figures on store shelves in July with a MSRP of $19.99.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Super Dungeon Tactics v1.2 Brings Big Changes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/463160&quot;&gt;Super Dungeon Tactics&lt;/a&gt;, for those who are unfamiliar, is a digital take on the wildly popular dungeon crawler, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2liER6S&quot;&gt;Super Dungeon Explore&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s not a true digital port, it’s familiar enough that players of SDE will feel right at home. I saw SDT at PAX East last year and have been eagerly awaiting its release. It’s out now and there’s some big changes on the way based off player feedback gathered by Underbite Games. On Thursday the following updates will take effect in v1.2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Achievements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 New levels including 3 boss battles and 3 unique challenges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Streamlined Guildhall with combined locations and better inventory management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many UI tweaks like damage preview and better hero selection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Hot Keys for rotation, cycling heroes, and ending actions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most difficulties have a health recover for ALL heroes not just revived ones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bug Squashing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got copies on hand and are currently enjoying the game. Frank should have a review coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interview - Eric Bittermann of Sky Kingdom Games</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days I’ve shot some questions back and forth with Eric Bittermann of Sky Kingdom Games about Land of Zion, and Expandable Card Game currently up on Kickstarter. I’d seen some buzz about it online and was immediately drawn to the game’s style. Below you’ll find the full interview, with link to the Kickstarter project at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/landofzion/box.png&quot; alt=&quot;Land of Zion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for taking the time to answer some questions. Tell me a bit about Sky Kingdom Games and how Land of Zion came to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey Rob! LOZ started around 15 years ago when a group of friends got together and created a miniature based game that used various mechanics from games we enjoyed. Influences included Final Fantasy Tactics and Secret of Mana (both old school rpg video games).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the years the game evolved into a card based game, and we created our own tactical style combat system with a mix of unit positioning and resource management. The game was extensively play tested for years as we continued to add content to it. About 2 years ago we felt it was time to share the project with the world. We loved playing LOZ, and knew others would enjoy it as well. At that time I created Sky Kingdom Games, and began the process of bringing the project to Kickstarter to seek funding and get LOZ published and manufactured.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me more about the game? What were your inspirations? What can players expect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game is a dynamic expandable card and boardgame that blends a variety of play elements including resource management, dice rolling, card positioning, and tactical gameplay. 2-8 players compete on a large grid-based game board and matches take 45-60 minutes to complete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each player begins the game with a group of adventurers who have made their way to the valley of Lux to train and prepare for the upcoming battle against Tenebris. Throughout the game players will use speaking stone cards drawn from a community resource deck in order to perform various abilities in battle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The biggest inspiration for the game came from Final Fantasy Tactics. A game by Squaresoft (now Square-Enix). The game had tactical turned based gameplay, and the player crafted a team to suit their play style. We used ideas from that title as inspiration to create our own gameplay and transition that style of play to a tabletop game. We know players will love the unique style gameplay, and we are looking forward to the future expansions that will add additional content over the years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The game features some amazing artwork. In fact it’s one of the things that first caught my eye about Land of Zion. What were some of the inspirations there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We wanted to use a high fantasy theme for our characters, but give them a non-standard look. We use a ‘painterly’ style that has its own feel from typical fantasy artwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We spent many months searching the web for artists that had a style that fit our vision for the game, and we are excited about working with the team at Caravan studios to achieve that vision.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/landofzion/zionart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Land of Zion Artwork&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The game is currently up on Kickstarter and moving quite along. Can you explain a bit about your experience with Kickstarter? How much planning went into the campaign and how much support do you put in on a daily basis to help meet your goal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;KS has been a great platform for sharing Land of Zion with the community and definitely the best site for crowdfunding for boardgames. We’ve been preparing for our campaign for over a year reaching out to various project creators and project advisors. There’s a ton that goes into the planning and making sure all of the pieces are in place before you launch. Luckily the gaming community is a very supportive group that loves to help new project creators. Running the KS is a daily task full of social media promotion, talking with backers, creating content, making calls and sending emails. Too much to cover! Overall it’s a great experience and seeing others get excited about your project is very rewarding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like you’ve been busy! That’s about all the questions I have. Is there anything else you like to mention before we wrap this up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nope - appreciate your interest in the project and the interview. Thanks Rob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/landofzion/landofzion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Land of Zion Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skykingdomgames/land-of-zion-ecg&quot;&gt;Land of Zion Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and help the project become a reality!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paint Tutorial - Imperial Assault AT-ST - Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Posts in Series:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Imperial-Assault-AT-ST-Paint-Tutorial-Part-1/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Imperial-Assault-AT-ST-Paint-Tutorial-Part-1-5/&quot;&gt;Part 1.5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the model is assembled, it is time to put paint to plastic. First, I primed the model. Despite my ambitious intentions, I only used Army Painter’s Uniform Gray spray primer to cover the entire model (and I went ahead and glued the legs to the base). I sprayed the entire model with a nice even coat of primer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prime&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I primed the model, I mixed Vallejo’s Cold Grey and Army Painter’s Matt White in approximately a 6 to 1 ratio to create a nice base layer. To apply the base layer, I used a small drybrush to gently apply the paint to the model, being careful not to let the paint glob into the small detail areas. Once the base coat was applied I used Citadel’s Leadbelcher base to paint the guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/2-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the model was completely dry, using Army Painter’s Strong Tone, I gave the entire model a good wash. I made sure not to let the wash stain the broad surface areas too much. Using a paper towel, I continuously wiped the wash from these areas in a doward motion. This helped to create a weathered effect. However, with the AT-ST, an all-terrain walker, I was not too particular as some excess stain here and there only added to the battle-worn look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the wash was completely dry, I reapplied some of the base-coat paint to the broad surface areas to touch up the model. Next, I again mixed Vallejo’s Cold Grey and Army Painter’s Matt White in approximately a 6 to 2 ratio to create a lighter gray to add some highlights. I highlighted the model along the natural light-catching areas—the top of the model, the exposed areas on the back of the legs, and the top of any extremities. Next, I added some highlights using Citadel’s Leadbelcher. This helped to accentuate some of the machinery and to create a metallic mechanized look and feel. Applying the Leadbelcher delicately with a small detail brush, I was careful not to make unwanted marks on the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, using a small detail brush, I reapplied some of the Army Painter’s Strong Tone wash, making sure that every nook and cranny was covered so as to not miss any opportunity for detail. After the wash was completely dry, I mixed some Citadel Steel Legion Drab base, Citadel Carroburg Crimson wash, and Vallejo’s Sepia wash in an equal ratio. I used this watery mixture to add some rust and mud effects to the model. These were added under some of the nuts, bolts, and vents of the AT-ST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/2-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wash&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I turned my attention to the base of the model. I applied Citadel’s Stirland Mud Texture liberally with a drybrush. I used Vallejo’s Umber Wash to spread the Stirland Mud around to ensure that the entire base was covered. Stirland Mud is a great base for many models and I use it often to create outdoor bases. Once the texture paint had dried, I used a few shades of brown and green to create some moss and grass effects. Finally, I finished by applying some Vallejo’s Sepia wash to the feet of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/2-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Base&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. The AT-ST was relatively simple to paint and I am pretty happy with the way my model turned out. After I was finished, I felt motivated. So, I primed MHD-19 from the Return to Hoth box set using Army Painter’s Matt Black spray primer. Once the model was dry, I applied Citadel’s Leadbelcher base with a drybrush. Next, I applied some Army Painter’s Strong Tone wash and added a few points of detail to the eyes, chest, and hand-instrument using Vallejo’s Turquoise, Bloody Red, and Moon Yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/2-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MHD-19&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, I’ll tackle some of the organics. . . maybe the Wampa or the Rancor? Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - ModMic 5</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/modmic5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ModMic 5&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
I’m fairly new to the whole video/streaming world and up until recently, I’ve just been recording using my phone or computer’s built-in microphone. Obviously, this isn’t an ideal situation. I had been looking up microphones for a while, debating which one would be best for my needs when I received a press release from Antlion Audio. Antlion’s new ModMic, the ModMic 5, was hitting the market and they were looking for some reviews. A few weeks later I had a shiny new ModMic 5 to test out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ModMic isn’t one for fancy retail packaging. Antlion sends them out in a well-made case that holds everything in place and keeps your mic safe. Inside this case was my new ModMic 5, mute switch, 2 different lengths of cord, and some magnetic fasteners. There was also two small baggies containing a Y-adapter and a powered USB adapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/modmic/modmic5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ModMic 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was apply one of the magnetic fasteners to my favorite pair of headphones. I then wired up the ModMic, snapped it onto the headphones, and gave it a whirl. What a difference in audio! My voice was crystal clear in my streams. Yet something was off. There was still something not sounding entirely correct. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure it out at first…until I read the instructions for the mic. Turns out I had the ModMod 5 in uni-directional mode. You see, you can switch between a uni-directional mic and omnidirectional mic. Once I made the switch I couldn’t have been more happy with the quality of my audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in love with my ModMic 5. It’s an amazingly portable and high-quality mic. The ability to easily connect it to any pair of headphones make it an extremely flexible product. Now I don’t need to worry about the expense of a whole new right when I decide to upgrade my current cans to a better set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the ModMic 5 only runs at $70. Much cheaper than many other mics I was looking at before it arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t recommend the ModMic 5 enough. I’m happy I was able to take one for a spin, and I’m sure it’ll be my go to mic for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A ModMic 5 and accessories were provided for review by Antlion Audio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Ophidian 2360: Survival of the Fittest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/ophidian2360.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ophidian 2360&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ophidian first hit the scene over 10 years ago with Ophidian 2350, a CCG from Ophidian Games and Fleer. A few years back one Small Cave Games released a stand-alone, non-collectible version called Ophidian Wars. Now Hack &amp;amp; Slash games have created Ophidian 2360: Survival of the Fittest, a Expandable Card Game with an all-new look. 2360 is fully compatible with 2350, though there are some things you will need to keep in mind with older cards (this will be covered in an embedded video below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ophidian starts you off by having you choose up to 4 Gladiators worth up to a total of 10 Victory Points, then constructing a deck from the various Minions, Pumps, etc… available. There are several  2-player pre-constructed decks for sale that pretty much let you just setup and play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to win Ophidian:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have the most Victory Points at the end of the 4th wave.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be the last player with Gladiators in play.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be the first player to earn 12 Victory Points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be the first player to gather 15 Cheer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow of gameplay is rather unique. Players can continue to play cards and take actions as long as they’re playing “+” cards or taking “+” actions. Any card or actions that are “-“ cause the player’s turn to end. This makes for some interesting combos that can be played over the course of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a wave is complete there’s a Breather phase where cards are refreshed, Gladiators can level up, and more. To get a full idea of the rules and how to play, check out the videos below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSQvTYkUSKM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1PjASkDI-U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve never owned any Ophidian 2350 cards, I have seen some. Ophidian 2360 has completely overhauled the artwork and layout of the cards and they completely blow away the older sets. The card feel is comparable to other ECGs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also sent a set of acrylic Rage Tokens for the game as well as the neoprene play mats. Both take the game to the next level. The tokens are translucent purple, thick, and expertly cut. The mats are gigantic, covered in game artwork, and have everything to you need to keep track of cards, victory points, and cheer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ophidian 2360 took me and my oldest son a bit of time to learn and play properly. The rules sheet that comes with the 2-player sets doesn’t really help much. Reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackandslashgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ophidian2360-RulesSummary_v1.2.pdf&quot;&gt;full rules&lt;/a&gt; and watching the videos above &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; helped. Once we had the game down pat we really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve played a lot of card battle games. Other than deck builders they’re my oldest’s favorite type of games. The fact that Ophidian kept his attention says a lot. As soon as we finished our first game he was ready to go again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that my initial reaction to the game wasn’t as favorable. It felt too hard to get Gladiators’ levels up so I could play cards I had in my hand. This made the game feel a bit slow and clunky to me. About a week after we first played a new edition of the rules came out that allow multiple Gladiators to level up during a Breather, among other rule clarifications and tweaks, that pretty much fixed all the issues I had with the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ophidian 2360 is now a game both my son and I can enjoy together on a regular basis. I’m actually looking forward to the release of more cards so we can really dig into building decks and master flow combos. Ophidian is fresh, interesting, and a bit of a departure from your standard ECGs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paint Tutorial - Imperial Assault AT-ST - Part 1.5</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Posts in Series:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Imperial-Assault-AT-ST-Paint-Tutorial-Part-1/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no “right” way to paint your model. With so many personal style preferences and color options out there, the possibilities are limitless. Before touching a brush to a model, I always comb through the interwebs for some inspiration. There are a lot of very talented people out there sharing pictures of their painted models, tips, and advice, or how-to videos. It is worth taking the time to view some finished examples of the model that you are going to paint before you begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Sullivan, who runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldenhammer.com&quot;&gt;OldenHammer.com&lt;/a&gt; is someone that I frequently look to for ideas. His blog is loaded with photos of well-painted minis. His painting talent and abilities are light-years beyond my amateur skills and his work is a wealth of ideas for color options and stylistic techniques. I reached out to Matthew and asked him to share some images of his painted AT-ST. He agreed and here is the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/oldenhammer-atst.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OldenHammer AT-ST&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Used with permission from Matthew Sullivan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldenhammer.com&quot;&gt;OldenHammer.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take a moment and highlight this top-notch paint job. Matthew’s AT-ST sports a beautiful sandy weathered look. His ability to capture lighting and maximize layering really makes the model pop. He has done an excellent job in creating contrast in and around the more detailed mechanical aspects of the model. Notice the rust and grime effects. His careful attention to detail is what brings this model to life. Although I plan to create a far more basic muddy base, these are some things that I will attempt to achieve as I paint my model. If I have one-tenth the success of Matthew, I will consider it a job well done. Thanks again for sharing, Matthew. Keep up the good work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - The Lords of Rock</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/lordsofrock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Lords of Rock&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gods of the universe are losing their power, some even fading away.
A battle must take place over humanities souls but the gods know that war will lead to all their destruction. There’s only one solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A battle of the bands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lords of Rock is a rock and roll concert of Godly proportions. The prize for the best band? Our souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up and playing The Lords of Rock is pretty simple. Each player first chooses a Pantheon. Once they do they take one of the two lead Gods, then fill out their band with three more Gods. Each God has various skills: Guitar, Vocals, Bass, or Drums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One the players have their bands set up they each take 4 Venues from the shuffled Venue deck and a hand of seven Set List cards. The first player to take their turn is the Anchor Band and plays the first Venue from their hand. Players now take turns playing Set List cards to match the required skills on the Venue, or to decrease another player’s skills for the turn. The Venue is scored once every player has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out which player won the Souls on the Venue they add up the relevant skills from their band with the Set List cards they played. The player who has the highest score wins the Venue and the Souls Stones listed on it. Play continues until a certain number of Venues (determined by the number of players) are played. The player with the most Soul Stones at the end of the game is the victor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lords of Rock is mostly cards, being a card game. There’s also some Soul Stones that are the pretty standard plastic gems seen so often in games lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork on the cards is where the game really impresses. Each God is wonderfully illustrated in an epic rock fashion. The Venue Cards follow suit. The Set List cards are a bit bland and are more utilitarian than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the production quality is a step above good. Nothing amazing here, but by no means flimsy or cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lordsofrock/gods.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gods&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Rock Gods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had backed The Lords of Rock on Kickstarter because I loved the idea Gods rocking out for the souls of mankind. The art looked amazing, and the wonderful puns on the Set List cards made caused me to giggle a bit too much. The game looked like it oozed theme and there was no way I could pass it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving the game and playing it I’m still happy I backed it, but I felt like the game was a bit too simple to really keep my attention. A lot of the game depends on the luck of the draw with Set List cards, though setting up your band well does help. However, I found several times where I just didn’t have a good set of Venue cards to play, or good Set List cards to play on the current Venue. There are rules for refreshing your hand of both types of cards, but there didn’t seem to be enough opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the game. I just think I hyped it up in my mind too much before it arrived. It’s a step above a filler game but doesn’t quite reach that next level for me. It also feels a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; too long with a full compliment of players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, that’s just me. I’d read the rules for yourself and see if this is one that snags your interest. Unfortunately, I think this one won’t be getting much play in my house.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paint Tutorial - Imperial Assault AT-ST - Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lfAjKH&quot;&gt;Jabba’s Realm&lt;/a&gt; box set expansion for Imperial Assault and a few exciting add-ons coming down the pike, like the Jawa Scavenger Villian Pack (YES!), Hera Syndulla and C1-10P Ally Pack, and BT-1 and 0-0-0 Villain Pack, doing a painting guide for the AT-ST seemed like a good idea. I am an amateur painter, but every now and then I have some success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most painting tutorials jump right into the paint. But, I figured that I would back up and slow this one down. This first post will be about prepping the model. Unlike organic minis with lots of wrinkles or fur, the AT-ST is a hulk of flat matte metal surfaces with some mechanics here and there. That being said, there will be less washing and more reliance on dry brushing and layering to bring out the details of this mechanical monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/set1.png&quot; alt=&quot;AT-ST Paint Set 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, let’s take a look at what we’ve got. The AT-ST comes packaged in the base boxed set like most Fantasy Flight plastic minis—loosely placed in a plastic bag that floats freely in the box. When you first remove the pieces, carefully check to make sure that there are no damaged components. Fantasy Flight is always great about replacing pieces that arrive damaged. After you check them, take a close look at them. They should fit together snugly. If you have trouble inserting them, a glass of hot water will soften them and should allow you to slide them together without issues. This model does not require glue, but I am old school and generally glue my minis. Also, with other minis, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lfwUfh&quot;&gt;Army Painter “Green Stuff” Kneadatite&lt;/a&gt; to fill in the crevices can make an organic mini really come alive by eliminating the inevitable awkward line breaks that buildable plastic minis have after assembly. However, with this mechanized mini, no filler is needed. The breaks in the model will fit naturally with its assembly-line feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/set2.png&quot; alt=&quot;AT-ST Paint Set 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before assembly, inspect each component and locate the imperfections. I like to use 150 Fine 3M sandpaper for wood. But, of course, a traditional model file also works great. Just tear off a small coin-size piece of the sandpaper and gently (and lightly) sand down the excess plastic flaws. This will ensure a nice even coat when you apply your primer. I will discuss priming and painting in the next post in more depth. For the primer, I will be using &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lfEWVp&quot;&gt;Citadel Chaos Black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2lfI7Mx&quot;&gt;Army Painter Uniform Gray&lt;/a&gt; spray primers. I order most paints from Amazon.com. You can go to your local store, but usually, on Amazon, the price is right and with free two-day shipping, you can’t go wrong. I generally use a single primer for models, but for this larger model, a gray primer for the broad areas and a black primer for the inner mechanical models seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/atstpaint/set3.png&quot; alt=&quot;AT-ST Paint Set 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that not all blemishes need to be eliminated. Use your best judgment and remember, it is not a science. The model that I am using has some imperfections on the cabin piece. I am going to roll with it. In the end, it will make for some nice battle scarring. Once you are satisfied, go ahead and assemble the model. As for the base, at this point, you can attach it or not. For this model, I will attach the base to the legs later on in the process. I often find it awkward and difficult to paint bases. But, that might be just a personal problem. If you want the base attached, go for it. Once you are assembled and glued, you are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next post, we will prime the model and get painting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Brut@l</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/brut@l.png&quot; alt=&quot;Brut@l&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up on ASCII dungeon crawls like Rogue, Hack, Ragnarok, ADOM, and more. While I still enjoy modern rogue-likes like Risk of Rain, Dungeons of Dreadmor, and Rogue Legacy, my excitement upon seeing Brut@l was palpable. Stormcloud Games has managed to take old-school ASCII adventure and turned it into something modern and fresh. I jumped at the opportunity to review the game, and it’s become my latest addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brut@l is an isometric dungeon crawler with randomly generated dungeons. Players run, jump, and hack their way through the levels to find the stairs down to the next level until they die. Death is permanent, meaning you start fresh with a new character at the start of the dungeon every time you die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all is hopeless, however. Along the way, you’ll find food (even adventures get hungry!), blueprints for weapons, armor, potions, divine shrines, and more. There’s also letters hidden in each level of the dungeon that can be used to forge and enchant weapons from blueprints you have. Sometimes you get lucky and can beef up pretty quick. Sometimes you get screwed and end up punching and kicking your way through several levels of the dungeon, hoping to survive long enough to craft even a pitiful weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 four characters to choose from at the start of the game, each with their own perks and weaknesses. There’s the Ranger, Amazon, Warrior, and Wizard. The first three come equipped with a shield, while the Wizard starts the game with a ranged magic attack. Choosing one comes down to the style of play you prefer. I’m a Ranger guy, myself. Nothing like being able to pick off enemies at a distance (once you can find arrows and craft a bow!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a co-op mode where you and a friend can tackle a dungeon together.  Nothing like smashing your way through boxes and baddies with your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art direction of Brut@l is both unique and familiar. Pretty much the entire game is made of ASCII text brought into the 3rd dimension. It’s pretty hard to explain, which is why I’ve placed a video of the game in action below. Everything is super crisp, flows smoothly, and oozes with old rogue-like charm. Weapons are literally crafted from letters you obtain throughout play. The map, when pulled up, looks just like rogue-like games of old, complete with dots, brackets, tildes, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is striking, dark, and minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIs72kNF0-w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don’t know the last time I had more fun with a rogue-like game. At its core, Brut@l is a bit less complicated to play than old ASCII-based dungeon crawls, but it still manages to capture the feeling of excitement, exploration, and dread that the genre is known for. I find myself firing it up constantly for short bouts of adventure before cursing my luck when I finally have a good set of armor, weapons, etc… then fall down a hole and blow the whole adventure to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of how simple-to-control-yet-insanely-hard-to-play you’ve come to know and love about rogue-likes, the added ability to play cooperatively puts Brut@l over the top. Now instead of just screaming at your monitor like a raving lunatic, you can do it with those you love most. You can also blame them for all your failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s win/win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Steam copy of Brut@l was provided free for review by Stormcloud Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Element</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/element2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Element&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was luck enough to receive a copy of Element before it’s actual release. You can see my unboxing of the game &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Element-Unboxing/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I sat down with both my 11-year-old and 6-year-old sons ti give it a whirl and see what the hype is all about. It wasn’t long before the night had gotten away from us and a handful of Element plays were under our belts. Rather Dashing’s Cornerstone Collection winner hits shelves soon, then you can enjoy the game as much as we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Element is to surround your opponent’s Sage so they can’t move. A Sage is out of the game as soon as it’s surrounded, with no opportunity to draw Element Stones to replace those surrounded it. In a 3 or 4 player game you’re trying to surround the Sage of the player to your right. If you surround a different Sage, you’ve won the game for someone else. (Turn order moves &lt;em&gt;counterclockwise&lt;/em&gt; in games with more than 2 players.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup of Element is easy. Each player’s Sage is placed on the board in specific spaces depending on the number of players. All the Element Stones are placed in the included bag and mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn a player can take up to 4 Element Stones and move their Sage. Sages can move in any direction. The number of spaces a Sage can move depends on the amount of Element Stones a player chooses to draw from the bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 Stones - 1 Move&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Stones - 2 Moves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Stones - 3 Moves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Stone - 4 Moves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 Stones - 5 Moves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone placement and movement can be done in any order. Stone powers are resolved as soon as they’re placed. The different stones each have different effects. Fire stones cause the line of Fire Stones they’re placed in grow. Earth stones can be double-stacked for form mountains that cannot be replaced on the board. Earth stones connected to mountains create ranges that can’t be moved diagonallay through. Water stones cause other connected Water stones to shift. Wind stones allow a Sage to skip over them as a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things to keep in mind is that stones can be replaced on the board by Element Stones that trump them in the elemental cycle. Water replaces Fire. Fire replaces Wind. Wind replaces Earth. Earth replaces Fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more info on Element Stones and how they work, check the full rules &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.wix.com/ugd/8b63b7_52f19a4038da49619f6a5eb321e0ed24.pdf&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Element has been wonderfully produced by Rather Dashing. The box and board are sturdy with excellent designs. The Element Stones are plastic and each stamped with their respective symbols. Element includes a beautifully made cloth bag to hold all the stones. I’ve never seen a more well-made bag come with a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real gem, though, is the Sages. They’re beautifully sculpted and feel wonderful to hold. The muted colors, match with the beautiful board design, really bring the game to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/element/sages.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sages&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Such beautiful sculpts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had no trouble learning Element and jumping right into play. It took a full game to really understand how each Element Stone worked and to start developing some strategies. Once we did we had an amazing time with the game trying to outdo each other and manipulating the board with our stones. Element never felt unbalanced, and games usually came down to the wire before a Sage was completely surrounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choices were easy at the start of our games, with all of us drawing a full compliment of 4 stores and only moving our Sages once. As the games drew on we found it more and more necessary to draw fewer stones and move our Sages more. This made it a bit harder to trap the other Sage. Risks started to be taken until one person slipped up and found themselves surrounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of pulling more stones versus having more mobility with your Sage can be nail biting. Well-placed stones can have dramatic effects on the board, making the game have a very fresh and dynamic feel to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall Element was a winner for us. Though abstract, the beautiful design and effects of the Element Stones bring a wonderful thematic feel to the experience of playing. I’m already looking forward to my next play of the game, and I may have to bring this one to work to try on my coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Villages of Valeria</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had only recently heard about Villages of Valeria and reached out to Daily Magic Games with an inquiry to review the game. A few days later the game showed up at my doorstep and now I can provide you fine folks with some pictures of what comes in the box. I’m hoping to get a chance to play the game this weekend and then get my review written up sometime next week. Until then, enjoy the pretty pictures!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Siege</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/siege.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Siege&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, I had never even heard about Siege until it showed up on my doorstep a few weeks ago. Apparently, AEG is aware that people may have missed out on this game with the craziness that is the holidays. Released in December of last year, Siege is a card-based strategy game of deduction for 2-6 players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules for Siege are actually really easy, taking only a few minutes to learn. The game is setup my each player placing all their cards face down in a row in any order they wish. The cards are kept hidden from other players, but each player can always peek at their own cards if needed. Each turn a player must take one of four different actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go Into Siege&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch an Attack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fall Back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a player goes into siege they take one of their cards and place it up against another player’s card. The card that was moved is now “In Siege” while the other player’s card is “Under Siege.” This is the meat of the game and the basis for setting up an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A player may launch an attack with one of their cards that are “Under Siege” or “In Seige.” The defender then secretly compares the combat values of each card without revealing the cards to anyone else. If the defender’s combat value is equal to or greater than the attacker’s, the defending card stays where it is and that attacker gets discarded. If the attacker’s combat value is higher, both cards are discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sacrificing a card lets you flip it over, activate its ability (if it has one), then discard it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falling Back is the only action that can’t be chosen, but it forced upon a player. If, at the start of their turn, a player has a card “In Siege” without it being opposite to a card that’s “Under Siege” it must fall back into the player’s row of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with these actions each card has it’s own unique ability with the exception of the Gong Farmer. Examples are the assassin’s ability to instantly kill a King or Knight, or the Gatekeeper’s to get a boost in combat value if they’re on either side of the player’s row. Gong Farmers have no ability or combat value. They’re basically canon fodder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until only one player’s king is left standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the full rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alderac.com/images/2016/09/rulebook.pdf&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much in the sturdy box AEG provides for Siege. There are a rulebook and 42 cards, six cards in six different colors. One color for each player. The cards themselves are oversized, glossy, and pretty thick. They almost feel like a cross between heavy cardstock and cardboard. They have a very pleasant feel to them and they seem like they’ll hold up well over multiple plays of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/siege/siegecards_104.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Siege Cards&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;A sample of Siege cards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried Siege was a two player game with my oldest son. It was a bit rough as we got used to the cards and how they interacted with each other. It also felt a bit…off with just two players. Adding in more players made the game &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more enjoyable, providing a much longer game and a more interesting dynamic between players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fun here comes with the unknown. At any point, an assassin may show up to instantly kill a King. Each attack has the potential to instantly win the game for the attacker, or severely cripple their plans. Sacrificing and Gong Farmers become essential to save your other cards and figure out how your opponents have their cards lined up. Sometimes just having a card “In Siege” without actually launching an attack can be a good tactic to save your bacon for another few turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having never heard of Siege, I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got a chance to put it through its paces. While it’s not my favorite game my AEG, it’s certainly a solid little game, especially for the price.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Pocket Kingdom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pocketkingdom/pocketkingdom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pocket Kingdom&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published by Plug In Digital, and WhisperGames, Pocket Kingdom is an indie puzzle platformer released on Steam back in December. The game is a throwback to the Amiga days of old and certainly, captures the look, feel, and sounds of the era. I’ve had the game for a while now and have certainly put it through its paces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game begins with a short sequence that shows the main character, a balloon pilot, crashing into a mysterious floating city. You’re pretty much tossed straight into the game from there without much in the ways of who you really are and what you need to do. Everything you learn about the where you are, and the game mechanics, are gleaned from sign posts and conversations with the strange inhabitants of the Pocket Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re also not told where to go. You need to explore, figure things out, and repeatedly backtrack to areas you can access. It’s a puzzle game meets Metroidvania kind of vibe all wrapped in a steampunk theme. The main mechanics for the puzzles here are block pushing, ladder climbing, and gravity. Along the way, there are other items that will help you out, like boots, a rocket launcher, and a grappling hook. By helping you out I really mean add complexity to puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the puzzles are pretty easy to solve while others can be brutally tough, or even unsolvable until later in the game. All the while you’ll be moving through the Pocket Kingdom and slowly putting the pieces of the story together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is self-described as an Amiga throwback and this really shows. A lot of care has gone into making the pixel art really feel like it’s from that era of gaming. The chiptune soundtrack is also really amazing and can be [purchased separately](http://store.steampowered.com/app/462620/ through Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the screenshots below give you a good idea of the overall atmosphere of the game, you should really check out the trailer that follows them to see how it moves and sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pocketkingdom/pkscreens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pocket Kingdom Screens&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Amiga-like graphics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHpCqxdETfI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interested in Pocket Kingdom since the first press released I had gotten about it. I eagerly awaited my review code and jumped right in as soon as I had the chance. The combination of the graphics, soundtrack and old-school gameplay really sucked me in from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit worried about the puzzles, as I haven’t really played many puzzle games in a quite a while. While they were challenging, none of them took too long to solve or made me rage quit with frustration. I quickly learned the underlying basics and could them apply those lessons to future puzzles in a build-up that was very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pocket Kingdom costs $7 on Steam. There’s not way else to decribe it than saying it’s a &lt;em&gt;deal&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re a fan of puzzle platformers, you’ll love this game. If you grew up in the age of the Amiga and other early computers, you’ll love this game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 x 10 Board Game Challenge January Plays</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;January is over. It’s now time to check how well I’m doing in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/10x10-Board-Game-Challenge/&quot;&gt;10x10 Board Game Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve played a lot of games this month. Unfortunately not many off my list.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-avoidthevoid.png&quot; alt=&quot;Avoid the Void&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekfevergames.com/avoid-the-void.html&quot;&gt;Avoid the Void&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Plays&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 plays of Avoid the Void this time around, and both were at the very start of the time. I took the game to a Scouting overnight and taught a group of boys how to play. It was a big hit, but unfortunately that meant that I had to sit a bunch of games out to make room for others!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-tak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tak&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cheapass.com/tak/&quot;&gt;Tak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Plays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve actually played Tak a few more times than this, but I’ve only played 3 times with &lt;em&gt;different people&lt;/em&gt;. This was part of the challenge I laid out for myself in the beginning. I really don’t see this as being a hard one to get my plays in. I’ve got another Scouting overnight coming up this weekend and Tak is always a popular choices with the boys.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-x-wing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;X-Wing&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing/&quot;&gt;X-Wing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got this one to the table with my 9-year-old daughter. We had a blast and are already adding new ships to our wishlist. I was surprised at how easy this one was to learn and how fast we were able to play with only 3 ships.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’m hoping that this month I can get some more plays in. It’s going to be tough, as most of our weekends are booked pretty solid with overnights and Toy Fair.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jungle Dragon Card for Arena of the Planeswalkers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;There are now 3 Jungle Dragon cards, each with a different ability. Test them out and comment on which one you like best!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Safari-Toys-Jungle-Dragon-Review/&quot;&gt;review of Safari, Inc’s Jungle Dragon&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned how I would be putting said dragon into good use with my copy of Magic: Arena of the Planeswalkers. I’ve finally gotten around to creating a card from the dragon to use with the game and have started testing out how well the dragon works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this needs a bit more testing and tweaking, but I wanted to share the current card for the dragon so other owner’s of this great piece can add it to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I make any updates to the card I’ll be sure to update it here, so keep this post bookmarked if you’re going to use it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Element</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just received my copy of Element from Rather Dashing Games over the weekend and I’ve been dying for a chance to sit down and take some pictures of it. While there’s not much in the box, what is in there looks great. The sage’s have a really nice feel, similar to the pawns in Onitama. The embroidered bag was much larger than I expected and also of a much higher quality than I thought it would be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire package is excellent overall. I can’t wait to really dig into this game and put it through its paces.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Shift DX 3DS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/shiftdx.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shift DX&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shift began its life as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://armorgames.com/play/751/shift&quot;&gt;online game&lt;/a&gt; back around 2008. There have been several sequels and iOS ports since that time. Now Shift DX arrives on the Nintendo 3DS containing all the levels from the first two Shift games and adds over 100 new levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, Shift DX is simple to control. You can jump and shift. Shifting causes the screen to flip, and your character to move from one color background to the other. Gravity also takes effect when you flip the screen. Using these two core controls you need to get to the exit of every level. Along the way, they’ll be switches, spikes, checkered spaces that you can’t move between at all, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “story”, if you can call it that, is that the female protagonist is running through test labs put together by a rogue AI. Sound familiar? The game never gets into the depth that Portal does, nor does the AI ever remotely captivate as much as GLaDOS does. It’s a thin veneer over a pretty abstract puzzle game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the main story, there’s also a Shift Challenge mode, a level editor, and a QR code system for sharing levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visuals in Shift DX are extremely low key. The game uses just two colors, sharp edges, and a character sprite reminiscent of Lode Runner. There’s no bells and whistles here, folks. Just pure, puzzle action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shiftdx/shiftscreen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift DX Screen&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;It’s not really GLaDOS, you know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shift DX is a game I can enjoy in small bites. It’s great to sit down and play a few levels, but I can’t play for an extended period of time without getting frustrated or my having my eyes start to hurt. The puzzles are satisfying, though the difficulty curve is a bit weird. Some puzzles seem overly complicated early on in the game, then others later in the game seem way to easy. It’s hard to tell if this is intentional or now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end Shift DX is a great puzzle game that I keep coming back to. It’s available through the Nintendo eShop on the 3DS as a digital download only. No physical copies of the game are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Shift DX was provided free for review by Choice Publishing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Legrand Legacy</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right; margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/984434986/legrand-legacy-tale-of-the-fatebounds/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legrand Legacy - Tale of the Fatebounds, a new game from SEMISOFT, is currently up on Kickstarter and almost funded. It’s a turn-based RPG with beautiful visuals and an interesting cast of characters. There’s also a castle mechanic where NPCs can help you rebuild and protect your headquarters throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEMISOFT has released an pre-alpha prologue that contains the entire first chapter of the game. It’s free to download, try, and provide feedback on. You can snag Version A and B &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamejolt.com/games/legrand-legacy/179162&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or Version B on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/556740/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;. What’s the difference between the two versions? The battle system. SEMISOFT would really like people to play both and let them know which version of the battle system they enjoy more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legrand Legacy is almost funded. A pledge of around $18 will ensure you get a Steam and DRM-free version of the game when it’s complete. The higher tiers can get you earlier beta access, the soundtrack, and your name in various in-game credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of this sounds interesting, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/984434986/legrand-legacy-tale-of-the-fatebounds?ref=project_tweet&quot;&gt;Kickstarter page&lt;/a&gt; for all the info you could ever want about the game. Some screens from the game, and a video that contains a bit of gameplay, can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon Duel for Mobile / Pokémon Bank Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s been two new announcements coming from the Pokémon camp in the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is Pokémon Duel, a new mobile game for iOS and Android that brings the excitement of of a tabletop game to your phone or tablet. The goal of each match is to get your Pokémon to the other side of the board by moving, battling, and blocking using your collected Pokémon figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is free to play, but you can buy more character boosters and plates (cards) to boost your deck and smash your opponents. The Pokémon Company has made it very clear that the game can be won, and everything collected, without spending any money. In-game apps are just use to speed your way along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve given the game a go and so far I’m enjoying it. Unfortunately it doesn’t feel like a game I’ll stick to, and despite what The Pokémon Company says about not needing to spend money, I feel like I’ll eventually hit a pay-wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kia_sP8Jlok&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next announcement released was about the latest Pokémon Bank Update, now with Sun &amp;amp; Moon compatibility. The new update lets you bring Pokémon from your previous games to the latest titles. New features also include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Pokédex that allows players to see info about Pokémon registered and connected to Pokémon Bank in the National Pokédex.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adventure Records, which allows players to reflect on their past adventures by evaluating their saved data containing interesting figures and stats like the number of Pokémon caught or the number of wild Pokémon encountered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transfer your Pokémon from the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console games Pokémon Red, Pokémon Blue, and Pokémon Yellow, and reveal previously hidden Pokémon stats like Abilities, Natures, Sp. Ark and Sp. Def, once imported to Sun &amp;amp; Moon!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Receive Poké Miles for every Pokémon deposited into the Bank and the length of time they remain, which may be redeemed for Battle Points to be exchanged in Sun &amp;amp; Moon for various items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go along with the latest update, a new event has been announced! Players who access Pokémon Bank from January 25th to October 2nd, 2017, will receive a Mewnium Z, the Z-Crystal for the Mythical Pokémon Mew, that cannot be obtained in the normal game. Give the Mewnium Z to a Mew which has learned the move Psychic, and you’ll unlock the powerful Z-Move Genesis Supernova!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 x 10 Board Game Challenge Picks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back toward the beginning of the month I posted about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/10x10-Board-Game-Challenge/&quot;&gt;10x10 Board Game Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve finally printed out the sheet and picked my 10 games. Here they are in no particular order (lies, they’re alphabetical.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-avoidthevoid.png&quot; alt=&quot;Avoid the Void&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;Avoid the Void is an excellent game that was released last year by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekfevergames.com/avoid-the-void.html&quot;&gt;Geek Fever Games&lt;/a&gt;. It’s faced paced, handles up to 7 players, and is ultra chaotic. Basically the idea of the game is to stay on the board as long as possible. If you ever run out of cards, or can’t move on your movement turn, you become a Void Beast who’s sole purpose is to mess with everyone else. It’s a hell of a good time, and one that I can find an audience for almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/avoid-the-void&quot;&gt;Purchase&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.thegamecrafter.com/1485194460/RulesDoc.pdf&quot;&gt;View Rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clear&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-brassempire.png&quot; alt=&quot;Brass Empire&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;Brass Empire is one of my favorite deckbuilding games. Put out last year by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockmanorgames.com/&quot;&gt;Rock Manor Games&lt;/a&gt;, it’s already sold out after an very successfully Kickstarter run and pre-order campaign. You can still snag the Travel Edition off The Game Crafter, but the full game is really one to seek out. One of the coolest parts? You can play a single player campaign against an automated opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;clear&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-dragondice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dragon Dice&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;Dragon Dice currently sits at the top as one of my favorite games, although it’s not one that really gets to the table that often. I’m hoping to change that this year, especially with the re-release of the Undead faction. For those who aren’t familiar, Dragon Dice has been around a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfr-inc.com/index.php&quot;&gt;SFR, Inc&lt;/a&gt; has kept it alive and has done an amazing job putting out new products and reprinting older ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-dreadball.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dreadball&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;Another of my favorites, Dreadball is a fast-paced, sci-fi sports game by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxsYKi79jRAhXHqFQKHU_mCEEQFggcMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.manticgames.com%2F&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNErbmbedfdPP63_3bHHItSRUoNDRQ&amp;amp;sig2=umP9n1DNJvN3JILWt3NdAA&quot;&gt;Mantic Games&lt;/a&gt;. I was introduced to this one back in 2013 at my first PAX East. While not a sports fan, this one really captured my attention. I’ve since gone on to assemble several teams (though haven’t really painted them yet) and played a few games with my kids. This is another I’ve added to the list because I really want to get it to the table more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-gruff.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gruff&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;Gruff is an excellent mutant goat card-battling game put out by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.studiowoe.com&quot;&gt;Studio Woe&lt;/a&gt;. Pick a Shepard and build a team of Mean, Weird, and Fat Gruffs to decimate your opponent’s team. I was first introduced to his while previewing it’s stand-alone expansion, Clash of the Battle Goats, when it hit Kickstarter. I was given a copy by the designer last year at PAX East to round out my collection. It’s one my oldest and I have a great time playing, and it certainly deserves more table time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-guardiansofasundur.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guardians of AsunDur&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;Guardians of AsunDur was the runner-up for Best in Show at the first ever Connecticut Festival for Indie Games, and for good reason! It’s a cooperative game where Angels are trying to stop Corruption from entering the world. The game employs great mechanics that really force the players to work together or suffer horrible defeat. Streamlined play, beautiful art, and easy to learn. There’s not reason &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dphstudioz.com/index.html&quot;&gt;DPH Studioz&lt;/a&gt;’ game shouldn’t be on this list. The problem? The game isn’t out yet. The solution? I’ve got an in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-herorealms.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hero Realms&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitewizardgames.com/herorealms/&quot;&gt;White Wizard Games&lt;/a&gt; made waves when it first released Star Realms, an excellent and extremely inexpensive deckbuilding game. Hero Realms is the fantasy version of the game, though it has a few different mechanics that can be added in. Character Decks allow players to start with different hands, and have different cards available to them throughout the game. Soon a Campaign Deck will be released that allows players to play a longer game where their heroes can level up and gain more powerful cards as the campaign progresses. It’s fantastic, and I can’t wait to get my hands on everything that’s released for it.&lt;/p&gt;

I picked up the Pocket Edition a while back but haven’t gotten it to the table yet. There’s also a new, boxed 6th Edition coming out that looks pretty amazing. OGRE may be old, but it’s stood up well over time. Time to teach the younger generation and also get my dose of awesome nostalgia!&lt;/p&gt;

The game had a phenomenal Kickstarter campaign, but Cheapass also released the rules and piece dimensions for those who want to make their own sets. I was able to 3D print pieces I found on Thingiverse and make a crappy fabric board so I could take this one wherever I go. I played a lot of Tak this year, and I don’t see that changing this year. Why add it to the list? My goal is to play Tak not just 10 times this year, &lt;em&gt;but with 10 different people&lt;/em&gt;. I love spreading the joy of Tak, and couldn’t leave this one out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10/2017-x-wing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;X-Wing&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;I’m way behind the times when it comes to the X-Wing Miniatures Game. I’ve even had The Force Awakens core set for months now and still hadn’t opened it. That changes now. I got my first game in yesterday and I can already feel myself sliding down the slippery slope of looking up new ships and shopping for the best prices. My daughter especially loves miniatures games and she, too, has fallen in love with the game. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to get into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing/&quot;&gt;Fantasy Flight&lt;/a&gt;’s miniature empire (pun intended.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Safari Ltd Jungle Dragon Dragon</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/safaritoys/howisafari.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How I Safari&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Back in October I did my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Safari-Toys-Behemoth-Dragon-Review/&quot;&gt;first review for Safari Toys Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. Since then I’ve been chomping at the bit to add to my Mythical Realms collection. Safari came to the rescue by sending me their new Jungle Dragon to take a look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the Behemoth and Crystal Cave Dragon I previously reviewed, the Jungle Dragon is hefty and rugged. The size feels great in the hand. This isn’t a small toy that’ll easily get lost or broken. While this dragon looks amazing on my shelf, it’ll look even better on a Magic: Arena of the Planeswalkers board, or map while playing D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of Safari’s toys is how useful they are in imaginative play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation of these toys is key. Safari Ltd toys generally don’t have any packaging. The toys are put out on a shelf, or laid out in a box, with just a Safari Ltd tag around their neck or body. The same is true with the Jungle Dragon. The toys speak for themselves with no other advertising other than their beautiful sculpts and paint jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jungle Dragon, or Draco truncatis by it’s scientific name, stands 5” tall and is a bit over 4” long. It has no wings, which generally I don’t dig on dragons, but really works here. The detail on this creature is amazing. The antlers looks like scraggly branches, the legs like tree trunks. The dragon’s body is covered in individual leaves and even has a few mushrooms growing here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/safaritoys/jungledragon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jungle Dragon&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Check out the amazing detail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again I’m left impressed by Safari’s offering. It has a classic feel and a toughness that can stand up to hours upon hours of play. This particular dragon will serve well while playing Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, or Arena of the Planeswalker like I stated before. When it’s not protected its jungle domain or hiding from intrepid adventurers it’ll be on display in my cubicle at work. This Jungle Dragon is a piece that just needs to be shown off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Jungle Dragon was provided by Safari Toys for review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Hasbro's Beyblade Burst - Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beyblade Burst is finally showing up on store shelves in the US allowing fans in the states to finally snag these awesome Beys at reasonable prices. I was able to get my hands on some more of Hasbro’s releases, and I’m still pretty impressed. Stadiums are still a disappointment, but I didn’t expect Hasbro to produce any of quality like Takara Tomy does. What I was surprised with is that Hasbro released the Supergrip Launcher. This gives me hope that we’ll see more Beyblade accessories in the future, hopefully an actual grip with add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Attack on Titan: Deckbuilding Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/attackontitan.png&quot; alt=&quot;Attack on Titan&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in November, I took some &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Attack-on-Titan-Unboxing/&quot;&gt;unboxing shots&lt;/a&gt; of Attack on Titan. Unfortunately, it sat, unplayed, on my shelf for quite some time after that with the craziness that is the holidays. Finally having a chance to sit down and play, I discovered a very competent deck builder with a movement mechanic that really brings the game to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attack on Titan plays very similarly to other deck building games. You’ve got two types of currency which you’re using to acquire cards and defeat titans. The different with AoT is that there’s a spatial element to the game and players have to move around to purchase cards they want and to get to the titans to kill them. The goal of the game is to kill the four Archenemy Titans shuffled into the deck, each one harder than the last. You lose if a number of heroes are killed (depending on the number of players) or if all the walls are destroyed by the titans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk a bit about the walls, and they’re extremely important to gameplay. There’s five wall segments, each with 2 health each. During the game, cards will be placed at the segments which players can purchase using Power, one of the currencies in the game. The other currency, Move, allows you to move from segment to segment in order to purchase the cards that are &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. There’s also &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the wall where titans will be placed. It costs an extra movement to move from inside to out or vise versa. Titans will damage the wall at the end of the round unless there’s a hero there to soak up the damage. Normal titans will do one point of damage to a wall, while Archenemy Titans will do 2. Heroes can take Wound cards to prevent this damage. Wounds are dangerous, though. If two or more come out into your hand, or in play, your hero dies and you need to pick a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you kill these titans? Normal ones are easy. Move over to them and pay their cost with Power, just like any other card. Archenemy Titans are a bit harder. They’ve got health that needs to be taken down with Power before you can pay their cost for a kill-shot. They also slowly regenerate between rounds. On top of that, you’ve got a deck of Titan cards to draw from when you attempt a kill-shot that can stop you in your tracks. These can add cost to a titan or screw with your attack in several other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the barebone basics of the game. Each hero also has their own special power, titans have ambush powers that are resolved as soon as they come in play, and Archenemy Titans have ongoing powers that resolve at the end of the round. There’s also cards you can keep in your hand that can stop and ambushes power from resolving. Unlike other deckbuilding games, it’s not always in your best interest to lay down all your cards on your turn. You may want to wait until that Titan on Attack card is played before revealing more cards from your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attack on Titan supports 1-5 players, but it’s really best with 2-3. Solo defeats the purpose of teamwork here, and 4-5 players just takes too much time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production value of Attack on Titan is most excellent. Character Cards are oversized and easy to read. The characters are a thick cardboard that fit tightly in their stands. Cards are glossy and sturdy, as are the Wall Cards and Tokens. The box insert, while a bit excessive in the space it provides, will surely come in handy if expansions are released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue I have with the components is the damage tokens. They’re &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; tiny, hard to pick up, and slide around the Archenemy Titan cards like nobody’s business. Dice really come in handy here, so if you’ve got some spares I’d use those to track titan damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/attackontitan/pieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Attack on Titan Pieces&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Not just cards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that I’m a fan of deckbuilding games. Games like Brass Empire, Demonslayer, Star/Hero Realms, and Ascension are big hits with me and my oldest son. Attack on Titan is no exception, and what really makes it shine is the movement mechanic and the cooperative nature of the game. Zipping around the walls fits very well with the Attack on Titan theme, and it’s ultra-satisfying to take down titans with the help of your fellow players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’m not the biggest fan of the Attack on Titan anime/manga. Thankfully you really don’t have to be to get enjoyment out of this one. Would it be cooler with a TMNT theme, or something else similar? Yes. It totally would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, Attack on Titan works best with 2-3 players. While there is a solo campaign, it kind of falls flat. Playing with more than 3 players just feels like a slog, with games reaching the 2+ hour mark. 2 players is the absolute sweet spot with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last bit I’d like to talk on is how challenging the game is. It’s not a walk in the park, and that’s a good thing. My oldest son and I lost more than we win. That just makes victory all the sweeter when we do pull it off. Of course it always feels like a victory when taking any Archenemy Titan down. They’re beasts, as they’re meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: If you’re a fan of Attack on Titan or deckbuilders, this is one to try out. It’s also compatible with all of Cryptozoic’s other Cerberus engine games. I can’t comment on how well that works since I don’t currently own any other Cerberus games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/familiargames/mageling-0/description&quot;&gt;Mageling&lt;/a&gt; is a “dice-activation” game being Kickstarted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.familiargames.net/&quot;&gt;Familiar Games&lt;/a&gt; that promises to bring the feel of a deckbuilding game without card shuffling or sorting. Dice are used for obtaining and activating cards throughout the game as players race to cure the Evertree of a horrible curse that was put upon it. The game handles 1-4 players and can be played cooperatively and competitively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mageling looks wonderful from what art they’ve posted up on the project. It also looks like it’ll fund if their current momentum holds. $10 will get you a print-and-play if that happens, while $27 will get you a physical copy of the game. The five levels of stretch goals are for promo cards, and these will be included with any physical reward level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out a run through of the game from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoLvU6o3JnE341uPAQ9KCUQ&quot;&gt;Radho Runs Through&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - The Rose King</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/theroseking/box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Rose King!&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally published in 1997 (with a theme of farmers and ranchers), then reprinted in 1999 as part of KOSMOS’s 2-player series, Rosenkönig was never really an easy game to find in the US. Last year Thames &amp;amp; KOSMOS brought a new reprint to the states, titled The Rose King. The game brings almost a nostalgic feeling back when playing, and really fits well into the KOSMOS 2-player frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rose King, like many in the KOSMOS 2-player series of games, has a simple ruleset. One player sits on the side of the board with the crown on it (the Red player) and other across from them (the White player). The Crown Token is placed in the center of the board, the Power Tokens off to the side and the Power Cards are shuffled. Five power cards are then placed face up in front of each player, the crown facing the same direction as the crown printed on the board. Each player also receives four Hero Cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn a player will take one of three actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play a Power Card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draw a Power Card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play a Power Card with a Hero Card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a player cannot take one of these three actions, their turn is skipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When playing a Power Card the player moves the Crown Token as many spaces as the card dictates (1 - 3) and in the direction the sword is pointing. The crown cannot land on any space that is already occupied, or move off the board. Once moved, the current player places a Power Token on the space with their color facing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A player may also play a Hero Card with their Power Card. This allows them to land on a space containing one of the other player’s Power Tokens and flip it to their own color. You need to use these wisely as you only have four for the entire game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game ends if neither player can make a move or the last Power Token is played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the game is to create territories of your own color. Different sized linked areas are scored a different amount of points. There’s a handy chart in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thamesandkosmos.com/manuals/full/691790_theroseking_manual.pdf&quot;&gt;rulebook&lt;/a&gt; to help you figure this out. The player with the most points at the end of the games is the victor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The components, while minimal, are well made. The cardboard tokens are easy to pick up and the cards, while a bit on the small side, are easy to handle since they’re on the table and not held in your hands. The board is illustrated beautifully, with the wooden Crown Token really the only piece that really stands out during play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/theroseking/pieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Rose King Pieces&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Beautiful to look at. Easy to learn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I stated above, the game really brings the nostalgia of earlier 2-player KOSMOS games back in a big way. That’s probably because of it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an older KOSMOS game. Gameplay hasn’t been touched in this latest edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme here is really pasted on but provides a nice visual aspect. The Rose King is an abstract at heart, and I don’t fault it for this in the least. I’ve played it with my oldest son (the abstract fan in our household) and we both really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something satisfying about moving the single Crown Token over the spaces and trying to fill up the board with your own color. Flipping a key piece that ruins your opponent’s largest territory is a great rush, and the 20-30 minute play time feels just right. The game rewards careful planning, and games feel pretty tight until the last few moves if you play your Hero Cards right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s certainly a place in our collection for The Rose King, but I’m not certain how much play it’ll really get even though we’ve had a good time playing it. While it holds up great for its age, there’s nothing about it that really stood out in my mind as going above and beyond for a great gaming experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit torn on this one. It’s a solid game, by no means bad. It just didn’t make &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; of an impression on me. I don’t feel the need, and in the end it may be one that just slips from memory in time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Race to the Treasure!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/racetreasure.png&quot; alt=&quot;Race to the Treasure!&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty well known by anyone who’s read this site, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;, that my kids and I are big fans of Peaceable Kingdom games. The latest to arrive on my doorstep, Race to the Treasure!, requires a bit more thought on my little ones’ part. That’s a great thing. It’s got simple rules and quick gameplay, just what I’d expect from a PK game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal in Race to the Treasure! is to form a path from the Start Square to the End square before the Ogre reaches the end of the Ogre’s Path. You do this with Path Cards that are drawn each turn. On the way to the End, you’ll need to grab the three keys scattered across the board. It also might be a good idea to grab the Ogre Snack. This card lets you remove an Ogre card from the Ogre’s Path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you play the game you need to roll the two included dice 4 times and place the Keys and Ogre Snack on the board where the letter and number intersect. There can’t be two items on once space, so if you roll a combo that’s already been used you’ll need to roll again. After that’s done the Ogre is placed at the top of his movement track and the Path Cards are shuffled. Once everything is set up players take turns drawing Path Cards from the deck and placing them on the board to form their path. If an Ogre is drawn then that card must be placed on the Ogre’s Path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the gist of it. Make your path across the board, collecting keys along the way, and make it to the end before the Ogre. It’s super easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/raceforthetreasure/gmc2-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Race to the Treasure! Pieces&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Race to the Treasure! is part of Peaceable Kingdom’s “Green Commitment.” That means that it’s printed with soy-based inks, utilizes corn-based plastics, and is made with F&lt;a href=&quot;https://us.fsc.org/en-us&quot;&gt;orest Stewardship Council&lt;/a&gt; certified paper and wood. The game doesn’t even come shrinkwrapped, so there’s no plastic waste. Are the components any less nice, or durable? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in Race to the Treasure! feels sturdy, is well made, and feels like it’ll last a while. Peaceable Kingdom isn’t a company to sacrifice quality just to be green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race to the Treasure! has quickly become on of our favorite Peaceable Kingdom titles in a very short time. It hasn’t bumped Cauldron Quest, but it’s sitting in a solid 2nd place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it utilizes many common features to other PK games (A patch to track the “bad guy’s” path, items to slow down the game’s countdown, etc…) Race to the Treasure! still feels exciting and fresh because of the open nature of each player’s turn. Players choose how to play the path tiles to best get where they need to go. It’s not always the best, or most efficient, way, but the game can still be completed by the players anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the Ogre? We’ve seen this mechanic time and time again with games like The Great Cheese Chase, Stack Up!, and Buzz, but it doesn’t feel overdone. The Ogre isn’t very aggressive, and players will end up winning this game more often than not, especially if they’re able to grab the Ogre Snack. In my eyes this is a positive, giving younger players a sense of accomplishment but with a little tension as that Ogre gets closer to the End.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My older kids (11 and 9) enjoy the game, though I’m sure there’s plenty of other games they’d choose if it were up to them. My younger guys (6 and 3) really have a good time with this one. It’s a game that I don’t mind bringing out time and time again with the little guy keeps requesting it, and that’s all I can really ask for in a kid’s game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>88 Heroes Gets a Physical Release</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rising Star Games today announced that &lt;a href=&quot;http://88heroes.com&quot;&gt;88 Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, the chaotic 2D action platform game from acclaimed development studio Bitmap Bureau, will release in March 2017. Available digitally on the PS4, PC, Mac, Linux and Xbox One, 88 Hereos is also getting a special, physical release on the PS4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;88 Heroes Key Features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;88 unique and original playable characters, each with their own skills and abilities that may help - or hinder! - the player.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hero order is randomly selected with each play, meaning players will always face a fresh and varied challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;88 levels across 4 zones to conquer, each with its own unique boss encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple game modes including: Magnificent 8 mode - choose a team of just 8 heroes to tackle the entire game with; Solo mode – pick just one hero and master their skills in order to survive as long as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 additional heroes and 8 new levels in H8 Mode are featured exclusively to the physical boxed edition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the action from Dr. H8’s lair as he tries to thwart your plans, drinks coffee, takes bathroom breaks and berates his accident-prone henchmen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More heroes incoming with DLC!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NBep-0ywusI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical version of 88 Heroes actually has 90, with two new heroes being exclusive to the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cath Letics - Her super-sprint and long jump skills are activated by hammering the action button just like in an athletics videogame of yesteryear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Mime – Push the action button and The Mime will perform the classic “trapped in a glass box” mime action, confusing and befuddling enemies and making them turn away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/88heroes/cathletics.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cath Letics&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Cath Letics, an exclusive character in PS4 box edition of 88 Heroes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really loving the overall look of this one, and can’t wait to get my hands on a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tokyo 42 - A Mix of Syndicate and GTA1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I received an email about Tokyo 42, a new isometric shooter coming out for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 later this year. Developed by SMAC Games and published by Mode 7, Tokyo 42 claims to be the lovechild of classic games Syndicate and GTA1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game you’re a  freelance assassin in a world where sinister forces are at play, taking on missions to pay your way and becoming embroiled in all sorts of cyber-shenanigans.  There are also cats, bullet physics, jumping with air control, sneaky stealth, and crowd simulation all wrapped up in a unique, visually stunning veneer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no concrete release date yet, but preview builds will be going out in February. I’m hoping to snag one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mega Man Mobile Out on Google Play Store</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Capcom has released the first six Mega Man games have been released on the Google Play store today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They look terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a terrible frame-rate, the games do no support a Bluetooth controller. That means you’re limited to the virtual controls on the screen. These two things alone kill the twitch-based side-scroller that so many of us have grown up with and remember with such fondness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capcom seems to have blown this one. The games feel like a very rushed and forced attempt by Capcom to get money from nostalgic gamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a shame. The Blue Bomber deserves much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still feel like you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to own these, the links are below the trailer. Each game will run you $2.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Santorini</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/santorini2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Santorini&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Santorini hit Kickstarter like a storm, raising over CA$ 700,000 and blasting through its stretch goals. It’s a game focused on strategy but comes packed with beautiful 3D components and amazing artwork that elevate what &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9963/santorini&quot;&gt;used to be&lt;/a&gt; a purely abstract game into the thematic masterpiece. A wonderful update to an excellent game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roxley’s subtext for Santorini has been “Learn it in 30 seconds. Play it for life.” This holds true for the very basic playing of the game. There are only 3 basic rules to the game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move - Move one of your two builders to a neighboring space either orthogonally or diagonally. A builder can move up one level, or down any number of levels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build - After moving you may build in any space next to the moved builder. There’s 3 levels to a building plus a domed cap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Win - If you can get either of your builders up to the 3rd level of a building, you win! A builder cannot move on top of a domed building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s more to it than that if you want a bit more depth. There’s a stack of God cards that can be used to provide tons of variation to how builders are moved, buildings are built, and more. The youngest player chooses as many God cards as there are players, and then the players choose which God cards they want. The power granted from that card is used throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want a bit more than that? There’s also the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0992126878/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0992126878&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=pawnsperspect-20&amp;amp;linkId=dd033e9f67d43314f3e40fe9edcba4c5&quot;&gt;Golden Fleece Expansion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=pawnsperspect-20&amp;amp;l=am2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0992126878&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt; which adds more God cards, Hero cards with powers that can only be used once per game, and a Golden Fleece token that changes the way God cards are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using the Golden Fleece, the token is placed on the board by the first player to place a builder. A single God card is chosen, then the player who placed their workers second takes the first turn. Whenever a builder is placed next to the Golden Fleece token that player can use the God power listed on the chosen card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santorini works best with two players, but there are rules for playing with 3-4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in Santorini’s box screams quality. The first thing you’ll be presented with upon opening the game is a softcover children’s story explaining how the game of Santorini came to be&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✝&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The book is beautifully illustrated and excellently crafted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the rulebook and the bottom of the board. Underneath that are the bags of building pieces, the builders, and the rest of the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/santorini/santorinicollage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Santorini Components&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Outstanding components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board is amazing, with the play space elevated a few inches off the table. The builder miniatures are finely sculpted and cast in a sturdy plastic. The building pieces are lightweight, yet strong, and fit together in a way that’s incredibly satisfying. The cardstock is thick, yet the cards are easily shuffled. As for the artwork and design, it’s all top notch through and through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santorini has some of the best components I’ve been in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I really love about Santorini is how accessible it is. Not only is it a great strategy game, but it’s packaged in a way that makes it friendly and approachable. While the game stands perfectly on its own mechanically, the updated design brings it light years ahead in the appeal department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous version of Santorini looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/santorini/oldsantorini.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old Santorini Board&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;An older, unthemed Santorini board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a fan of abstract strategy games, as is my oldest son. Getting my 6-year-old to play a game that looks like the one above may have been a bit of a challenge. Getting him to play Roxley’s version took no coaxing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of my 6-year-old, he was the first person to play Santorini with me. We spent some time reading the book and going over all the pieces in the box before playing our first game. Just as Roxley promises, it only took about 30 seconds to explain the rules to him and we were off. A few games later we had incorporated the God cards and he went from barely scraping by to besting his old man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things I love about Santorini. While it’s highly strategic, the rules couldn’t be simpler. Even when adding in the God cards, and even the Golden Fleece expansion, the game remains simple enough for my whole family to enjoy. To me, that’s the mark of a quality game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santorini has already seen a lot of play in our home in the short amount of time that we’ve owned it, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. This is one I’d love to bring to work for some lunchtime gaming with co-workers as it’s simple, attractive and something we could fit multiple games in the time we have. Unfortunately I don’t think my kids are going to let me take it out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one I’d say is a must-have for any gamer’s collection. It’s a serious strategy game that’s family friendly, easily accessible, and looks absolutely amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Santorini was provided free for review by Roxley.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✝&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The softcover storybook is a Kickstarter exclusive, and will not be included in the retail version of Santorini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tao Long</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right; argin-left:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gonab/tao-long/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thundergryph has a great new Kickstarter up and running. Tao Long is a game of two dragons trying to outdo the other, but are bound by Tao. Each action taken by one dragon opens up new options for the other to move, attack, or block. In the end, there can be only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about Tao Long looks amazing and it’s already something I’ve come to expect from Thundergryph, who recently wrapped up a Kickstarter for Overseers. Even the price (around $18 USD) is looking good for what you get in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has already smashed through its funding goal and is well on its way to unlocking all the planned stretch goals. This one seems to be a solid game to back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video below will give you a pretty good feel for what to expect. I’ve also got this on the way to preview, so will have more thoughts on it once I have a chance to play.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Santorini</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Roxley just sent me a copy of Santorini, a game I’ve been excitedly waiting for. It’s pretty awesome, but I’ll leave that for the review later this week. Until then I’ve snagged pics of all the amazing components that come with the game. Everything is top notch from the storybook to the 3D board to all the building pieces and amazing card art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included in the pics below is the Golden Fleece expansion for the game. They’re the last five pictures in the set.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 x 10 Board Game Challenge</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about the 10 x 10 Board Game Challenge now that the new year has started. The first place I saw it was on Tim Blank’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gameworthylabs.com/blog/578&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Gameworthy Labs’ site. The idea is to choose 10 board games and play each 10 times over the course of the year. Not an easy task, and even harder since I rarely play many games multiple times with the revolving door of review titles coming in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/10x10Chal.png&quot; alt=&quot;10x10 Challenge Board&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to let that stop me, though. I’m determined to finish this challenge and think it’ll be a great way to get some more play out of some great games that I normally wouldn’t play with all the new games arriving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t decided what 10 games to put on my challenge yet. I’ll probably sit down with the kids tomorrow and figure out the best ones to put on there. I don’t want to put a game that will be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy to get 10 plays in, but maybe one or two on there to help me move the challenge along will be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in taking on the challenge, chek out Tim’s post with a downloadable challenge board &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gameworthylabs.com/blog/578&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dragoon's Upcoming Expansion has a Print-and-Play Beta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laywastegames.com&quot;&gt;Lay Waste Games&lt;/a&gt; announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/oszkzkn4fp7wi4r/DragoonExpPNP_Beta3.zip?dl=0&quot;&gt;print-and-play beta&lt;/a&gt; of their upcoming 5-6 Player expansion for Dragoon. The expansion adds humans into the mix, specifically a Barbarian and Rouge. Each has their own nasty way to play and cause trouble for those pesky dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Rogue is a stealthy character, sneaking around other players, digging tunnels for quick movement across the map and managing a suite of six (6) pieces of equipment to gain access to all sorts of powerful abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Barbarian is an aggressive character, gaining levels by recruiting humans from population tiles to increase their ability to take on anybody!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first got whiff of this expansion at the CT-FIG Mid-Year Event had have been waiting (im)patiently for a chance to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to grab some printer ink!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2016 Five and Dime List</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of year again! Below is my Five and Dime list for 2016. What’s a Five and Dime list? It’s a list of all games I played 5+ or 10+ times. I review a lot of games, so not a lot get repeat play. It’s always interesting to see what games actually got played this much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real star of the year? Tak. Man, I love Tak. I’m still playing with 3D printed pieces and a sharpie-on-fabric board, but I’m looking forward to getting a much nicer set in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 or more plays&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Double Dragon IV Coming to PS4 and Steam</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/doubledragon/doubledragon4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Double Dragon IV&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Arc System Works just announced the latest installment of the popular Double Dragon series, Double Dragon IV, will arrive on the PlayStation®Network for the PlayStation®4 and Steam (PC) on January 29th and 30th in North America respectively (1/30 and 31st JST.) Key team members involved in the 1987 arcade version including Original Planner, Yoshihisa Kishimoto, Designer, Koji Ogata, and Composer, Kazunaka Yamane are involved with the game, with the story picking up after the elimination of the Black Warriors in Double Dragon II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a huge fan of Double Dragon since playing the original in arcades as a kid. I’m a little bit more than excited for this releases, and you can be sure I’ll be playing it on release day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A teaser trailer for the game has been released, and can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Gamer Deck 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a great run on Kickstarter, Gamer Deck 1 is starting to arrive in the hands of backers. You may remember my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Gamer-Deck-1-Kickstarter/&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; about the deck from when I first backed it. The turnaround from Kickstarter to delivered product was pretty quick, and now I’ve got my own Gamer Deck to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some shots of the packaging and cards. As you can see, there’s a lot of information on the cards other than just a suit and number. Each card has a game mechanic and die roll to go along with the suit, number, color, and icon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Future of A Pawn's Perspective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s almost 2017 and soon A Pawn’s Perspective will be a year old. The site has come a long way since I first started it as an overflow of items that didn’t really fit on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;. It’s grown by leaps and bounds, and I’m starting to feel like maybe using my own personal social accounts aren’t doing the content much justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, and slowly rolling out, I’m going to be setting up A Pawn’s Perspective as its own brand on the various networks I use to distribute content. There will be new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/pawnsperspective/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/perspectivepawn&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn0oN0SslDDS5Od5usgJ9fw&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/11005917&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and Periscope accounts setup and slowly filled with new content. It’s not easy to bring all the old content over, so I’ll be releasing these as they fill out. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pawnsperspective&quot;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; will stay the same since it’s already it’s own thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to be trying a few new things. Creator interviews, in-depth streaming, and possible some video game reviews and unboxings. I’ll be setting up a survey in the next few weeks to see what you, the readers, really want to see here. The end goal is to pull in more readers/viewers so I can start doing some really cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it all pan out? Who knows, but look for some changes soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Micro Unboxing Sandships</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Looney-Labs-Holiday-Gift-Sandships/&quot;&gt;last night’s post&lt;/a&gt; is my micro-unboxing of Looney Lab’s Sandships!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s micro because there’s not much to it before adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.looneylabs.com/Looney-Pyramids-Rainbow?sc=2&amp;amp;category=1676&quot;&gt;Looney Pyramids&lt;/a&gt; and dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said last night, I already have 4 sets of Pyramids from my Zendo set. I just printed a 5th set today that didn’t come out that great but will hold me over until I buy a full set of 5 (listed above). I also found a stash of blank dice I can sticker up. I’m all set to give this one a whirl!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, here’s Sandships in its unboxed glory.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Looney Labs Holiday Gift - Sandships</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sandships/sandships.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sandships&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;A wonderful surprise showed up in the mail today courtesy of Looney Labs. Packed into a neat envelope was Sandships, a Pyramid Arcade game that is played with stacks of 3 pyramids in 5 different colors. I haven’t opened it yet (I’m waiting until tomorrow to get some better pictures of it) so I haven’t read the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue? I think I may only have 4 different colored sets of pyramids that came with my Zendo set! This means I need to get another color…or now have an excuse to pickup the full Pyramid Arcade set. That, or possibly 3D print a quick set for now so I can get this to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll make sure to take some pics soon, and get a full review up once I have a chance to play.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Micro Review - Barnyard Battle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barnyardbattle/barnyardbattle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barnyard Battle&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KidRealm recently released a new stand-alone game called Barnyard Battle. Basically, it’s a re-theme of Castle Combat using barnyard animals and wrapped in a retail-friendly package. I got the game in the mail a week or so ago and finally had a chance to sit down and play with my home’s reigning Castle Combat champ, my 6-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I stated earlier, the game is just a re-theme of Castle Combat. You can checkout my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Castle-Combat-Review/&quot;&gt;previous review&lt;/a&gt; to get the basics of gameplay. The one major difference here is that, because it’s a stand-alone game, each player gets a randomly built deck with equal red, blue, and white ribbon cards. This makes sure each player has a fairly balanced deck to play against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnyard Battle was made for retail and is packaged a bit better than Castle Combat because of this. It comes in a resealable blister pack that’s pretty sturdy. The card quality is the same as other KidRealm titles, and the layout and artwork follow the more modern, much nicer, look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s really nice in this game is the custom dice. Each plastic die is engraved with a custom icon for the 6 side, one with a rooster and the other with a pig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is just as enjoyable with my 6-year-old as Castle Combat is. That being said both of our preferences lie with the theme and collectibility of Castle Combat. The ability to create decks from your own store of cards makes for a much more in-depth experience. Barnyard Battle has the advantage of not being collectible which seems like it would be more approachable to a family coming across it on a store shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barnyard Battle was provided free for review by KidRealm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>World Beyblade Organization Launches New Site for 8th Anniversary</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/8th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WBO 8th&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;After a lengthy downtime the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldbeyblade.org&quot;&gt;World Beyblade Organization&lt;/a&gt; has relaunched with a brand-new site for their 8th Anniversary celebration. The new site is fully responsive, bright, and airy. It’s a much-needed step in a modern direction for the WBO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with a new site, they also commissioned two new Beyblade characters by Takafumi Adachi, author of the Metal Fight Beyblade series and creator of legendary characters like Ginga Hagane, Ryuuga, and Zero. The two new characters, Taka and Fumi, represent the Beyblade spirit of all the WBO users and will be the visual core of all the WBO’s design going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a slew of other new things going on over at the WBO, including their yearly scavenger hunt and some tournament rule updates. You can see it all &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbeyblade.org/Thread-8th-Anniversary-Welcome-to-the-new-worldbeyblade-org&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More Pokémon Arrive in Pokémon GO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemongo/santapikachu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Santa Pikachu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Pokémon arrive today in Pokémon GO, including Togepi, Pichu, and several more select Pokémon from the Johto region. These new Pokémon can only be hatched from eggs, so make sure you hit up all your favorite Pokéstops to fill up on the hatchables. Thanks to several all-new Pokémon GO promotional partnerships, such as one with Sprint in the US, more than 10,500 Sprint and Boost Mobile and Sprint at RadioShack locations have turned into PokéStops and Gyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a new Pikachu in town. Donning a festive Santa hat and available to capture until December 29, 2016, 11:00 A.M. PST.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Overseers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thundergryph Games ran a really successful campaign with Overseers and I was delighted when the Deluxe edition of the game arrived on my doorstep last night. Not really wanting to wait, I dug right in and took some photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is quality, down to the plastic insert in the box that holds everything. The metal coin included is a great touch and it’s got a good weight to it. The artwork, while amazing, is a bit risque, so this isn’t one I’ll be playing with the kids anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kickstarter backers should have their copies now, or at least should have them soon. The game is currently up for pre-order on &lt;a href=&quot;http://thundergryph.com/overseers/&quot;&gt;Thundergryph’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Stack Up!</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/stackup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stack Up!&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;I’ve always been a fan of Peaceable Kingdom and their family-friendly cooperative games. Stack Up! is no exception. It follows a very similar formula to some of their other games but in a different manner enough to make it stand out in Peaceable’s lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing Stack Up! is very simple. You spin the spinner, collect the color block listed, and stack it. If you manage to stack all 12 blocks everyone wins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it can’t be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; easy or the game wouldn’t be enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hiccup in your plans is the Stack Smasher, a glove-shaped monster. If you the spinner lands on his picture then he gets to move up his movement track, ever closer to the stack. If he reaches the stack then it topples and everyone loses. He also gets to move if the spinner lands on a color that’s no longer available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spinner can also land on a challenge. When this happens a challenging tile is flipped over and the current player and the player to their left have to complete the challenge together, each using only one hand…or stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last wrench tossed into the mix are the sticks. Older players can use these to provide a bit more challenge. Each stick has two sides: one with a wooden pin and the other with a spongelike tip. The sticks become even more of a challenge during a challenge. Then each player involved takes one and tries to stack the current block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the game is really only very challenging for young children, which is the target audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/stackup/pieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stack Up Pieces&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Peaceable Kingdom is great about using recycled materials, and their boards, cards, and rules are all very nicely made. The Stack Smasher is a thick cardboard on a plastic stand and seems sturdy enough for the amount of use it will actually see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wooden blocks are light, painted, and fairly good quality. This isn’t fancy hardwood, but it works for what’s needed in the game. It would probably be a bit tougher to younger players if they were much heavier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sticks are solid, smooth, and put together rather well. The spongelike material on the ends doesn’t feel like it’ll come off anytime soon. I would suggest keeping an eye on little ones playing this, as they seem to think the ends look like marshmallows and need to go into their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stack Up! is another great game in an already excellent line-up by Peaceable Kingdom. I’ve played this one will all four of my kids and they all enjoy it, though my two-year-old and six-year-old get the most enjoyment out of it. It’s not a game I’d really recommend for families with older kids as it really does get &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier to play the older the players get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a light family game for younger kids? It’s great. The dexterity element is really nice for the really little kids as it’s enough of a challenge to keep them interested, but not so hard that they easily get frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Stack Up! was provided free for review by Peaceable Kingdom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Super Blackjack Battle II Turbo Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s Blackjack!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It tributes to a well known arcade fighting game from the ’90s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A rooster with 12 characters from all around the World such as Mark, an undercover FBI Agent, Kamiko from Japan, seeking revenge for her Uncles death or Gregor, a South African warlord.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ten different story lines with individual endings and dialogues in an epic Single player campaign&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Up to four player online matches where people can freely drop in and out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ranked online PvP mode with online leaderboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cross-platform online multiplayer for up to four players&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the list of features Headup Games and Stage Clear Studios has provided for Super Blackjack Battle II Turbo Edition. I’m really interested to see how this will actually play out, but the teaser video above is enough for me to keep following news about this one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Little Briar Rose</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little Briar Rose is a game I hadn’t heard about today, it’s release day. It’s a point-and-click adventure game with beautiful stained-glass artwork that absolutely takes my breath away. The game is available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/little-briar-rose/id1160731868?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mangatar.littlebriarrose&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/555290&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, and is $2.99, $2.49, and $7.99 respectively on those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is classic Brothers Grimm’s “Little Briar Rose”, with the player taking control of the fearless prince who must solve puzzles to enter the castle and awaken the sleeping princess. I’ve delved a bit into the game on my phone already and have been more than delighted with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator-</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite fighting game series, Guilty Gear, has its latest installment coming to Steam on December 17th. Titled Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator-, it will be available for $49.99, but will feature a launch-discount of 10%. Also, available at launch will be the One Dawn Bundle, which includes all of the DLC, for $64.99 USD. As a special bonus the game will include the GUILTY GEAR Sound Live 2014 Archives + which consists of 11 tracks plus 3 vocal tracks new in Revelator as well as Dizzy’s Maine Theme song “One Dawn”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve requested a review code, so hopefully I’ll be able to get a review written and some streaming done soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Earth's Dawn Hits Steam on December 7th</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A press release for Earth’s Dawn, a 2D action side-scroller, just hit my desk yesterday and immediately caught my eye. Developed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://one-or-eight.co.jp/&quot;&gt;oneoreight&lt;/a&gt; and being published in the US by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.risingstargames.com/&quot;&gt;Rising Star Games&lt;/a&gt;, it hits &lt;a href=&quot;http://reverbinc.us14.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=3bf7cfebe67d59589d33ba07a&amp;amp;id=01b60ef331&amp;amp;e=047d414620&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; on December 7th. It’ll cost $29.99 but will be 20% during its launch period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has a strong anime-look and boasts unrivaled weapon and skill customization along with fast and easy combat mechanics. I just received a review code so I’ll be streaming and reviewing the game soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Hex Casters</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hexcasters/box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hex Casters&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Hex Casters was created by five students at RIT: Douglas Mansell, Norman Greenberg, Tom Smith, Samuel Sternklar, and Alex Bogart. Originally called Hexes!! The Card Game, they submitted the game in an attempt to win the top prize of the national Hasbro Gaming Lab and Indiegogo “Next Great Game” contest. They didn’t come out on top, but Hasbro picked up the license anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hex Casters is a card game for 3-6 players where the goal is to have the least amount of Hexes at the end of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup is simple. Separate the Hex cards from the Defense cards and shuffle each pile. Every player gets one face-down Hex to start and a hand of five Defense cards. All the players then flip over their Hex cards and read them aloud. Every player needs to do what their Hex card says for the rest of the game. The youngest player takes the turn token and the game begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start a round the player with the player with the turn token draws and Hex and places it faced down in the center of the play area. They may then pass it to any player they choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a player is passed a Hex card they have two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play a Defense card from their hand to pass the Hex to another player.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the Hex, turn it over, and read it aloud. They must now follow whatever rules written on the card for the rest of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a player takes the Hex the round ends and players restock their hand of Defense cards back up to five. The turn token is then passed to the left and a new round begins. The game ends when a player has nine Hex cards of there are no more Hex cards to play. The player with the fewest Hex cards is the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things to note. You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; always follow the rules on your Hex cards. If you are caught not doing so you must take a Hex from the top of the draw deck and place it in front of you. This makes knowing what Hexes other players have and keeping an eye on them very important. Also, Defense cards are not restocked until someone takes the current Hex in play. Be careful how you use them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hex Casters is your typical mass-market quality game. The box is sturdy with a glossy, wrapped label. The card tray is a flimsy plastic that feels like it’ll break not long after the game is opened. The cards feel fairly sturdy and contain readable text, but fairly forgettable art. There’s a few blank cards tossed into the box if you’re feeling creative, or lose a few cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/hexcasters/tray.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hex Casters Tray&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;A small footprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hex Casters is a pretty average game. It’s better than most mass-market card games, but I feel like that’s not saying much. There are laughs to be had when players get Hexes stacked up on them, but the gameplay feels rather dull, with it really coming down to having the right Defense cards to make sure a Hex doesn’t land with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids seemed to have a pretty good time playing but they haven’t asked to play again and seem to have forgotten the game is on the shelf already. At $15 it’s not a horrible value, but there’s better games out there at the same price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy Hex Casters was provided free for review by Hasbro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tricksters Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aethertower/tricksters-the-first-game-with-the-mischievous-ann/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aether Tower reached out to me a few months ago asking if I’d like to try a prototype of their game, Tricksters. After a quick peek at some of the materials they sent over I agreed to give it a go in time for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aethertower/tricksters-the-first-game-with-the-mischievous-ann&quot;&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt;. The game is quick, fast-paced, and filled with adorable creatures called Annukuh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a preview and not a full review, I will be skipping the &lt;em&gt;4P&lt;/em&gt; (Prelude, Play, Pieces, and Perspective) format I’ve been using for reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our first play of Tricksters, the rules were a bit tricky to understand.After playing a few rounds, and watching Aether Tower’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br_EU6KLYHM&quot;&gt;instructional video&lt;/a&gt;, my kids and I had pretty much gotten the hang of things. In the game, players take turn drawing cards and placing them into a center pool of cards. After 4 cards are placed into the pool a scoring phase is triggered. You can see the full rules for the game, including scoring examples, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqIwFd0nXu1PdT8IGZlqxayGMr4b8tCPiY-Rkq79L_s/edit&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring can be a bit hard to grasp at first, but like I said earlier, it just takes some time playing to get things under control and then it becomes no big deal.  Players first choose a card from their hand to be their Avatar for the current scoring round. Then cards in the pool are sorted into piles based on their race of Annukuh. Depending on the number of cards in each pile they can be Perceivers, Keepers, or Tricksters. Different points are scored for each using a Light vs Dark, push-pull method of scoring. There’s also special powers on the cards that need to be taken into account. More on these powers can be seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIt1Too1os&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Once scoring is complete certain cards will then go back to the players’ hands, into the pool, or be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tricksters/box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Box&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;The goal of the game is to get either seven light points or seven dark points. Careful manipulation of the pool is needed to make sure you rack up the points you need without tipping the scales in the opposite direction you want to go. If you’re sitting pretty with six light points the last thing you want is to score off a pile of dark points that will bring those light points down. For example: If you had six light points but ended up scoring 7 dark from a pile, you’d now have 1 dark point. Light and dark always subtract from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did my kids and I enjoy the game overall? It was pretty fun once we got into the groove of things. My 6-year-old had a bit of a harder time understanding the concepts of the game but was able to enjoy himself even though he didn’t do very well. The others were able to fully comprehend what was going on and really dug it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tricksters is already fully funded, so all you need to do is pledge $19 to make sure you get a copy of the game when it’s ready to go. From what I’m seeing, the final version of the game will be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better looking than the prototype I received. The art and layout of the final cards is beautiful and clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype of Tricksters was sent for free by Aether Tower for preview purposes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Looting Atlantis</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/lootingatlantis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looting Atlantis&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Looting Atlantis is a game I first saw at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/CT-FIG-Mid-Year-Event-2016/&quot;&gt;CT FIG Mid-Year Event&lt;/a&gt;. After the event, Shoot Again Games was kind enough to send over a copy for me to take a better look at the game. I’ve had several chances to sit down with the kids and play, and the game has held up pretty well from what I remembered at CT FIG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before playing all the cards need to be shuffled and placed in stacks of four at each space on the board. Call four cards in each stack must be visible. Players then take turns placing their air cars on any unoccupied space on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn players need to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place a lava token on the board&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take two actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lava tokens must start at the volcano at one of the spaces marked with an arrow. From there they can be placed down their respective tracks towards the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After placing lava players take two actions from the following. Either action can be used multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Claim an equipment card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movement is easy. A player takes their air car and moves it to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; space, occupied or unoccupied, on the board. Claiming a card is just as easy. Take the top card of the stack of the space you’re currently at and place it in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I said there two things a player needed to do during their turn I kind of lied. There is an &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; thing players can do once per turn that doesn’t count as an action. That’s playing an equipment card. To play a card you drop it on the space you’re residing on, placing it at the bottom of the card stack, and resolve its action. Equipment cards can be played once per player per turn. That means you can play one on your own turn, or one during another player’s turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until the first lava token reaches the city spaces on the board. Once this happens players start taking &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; actions during their turn. Also, any space touched by lava has all the cards currently stacked there destroyed. If another player’s air car is there it’s placed off the board can be placed back on during that player’s turn for the cost of one action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game ends when all the spaces on the board are covered in lava, or all the players have made their getaway. On the edge of the board, there are three primitive kingdoms. At any point in the game, a player may escape to a kingdom, claiming it as their own, taking all their equipment cards with them to score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the game ends each player scores based on their equipment cards. This is the real meat of the game. Different color cards score differently based on how many of each you have, how many accompanying cards you have, and more. It’s important to snag equipment cards that will earn you the most points, and it’s not always easy to do! For more info on scoring, check the game’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=sites&amp;amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzaG9vdGFnYWluZ2FtZXMyfGd4OjUzMjIyZGEwNGRjNzQyZDM&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pieces are where Looting Atlantis falls a bit flat. The artwork, while not bad, isn’t very memorable. The cards feel a bit cheap, and there’s a lot wasted space on the board. Also, having the cards laid in stack &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the board is a bit cumbersome. It feels like with a little more though things could have been laid out a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real, solid components are the wooden lava tokens which are just orange discs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/lootingatlantis/pieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looting Atlantis Pieces&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Here comes the lava!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looting Atlantis is really easy to learn, fairly quick to play, and a lot of fun once you get the hang of scoring. It takes a few games to really get a feel for all the different equipment cards and the best ways to rack up a good score. While my kids enjoyed the game, my 6-year-old and 9-year-old were getting a bit frustrated with the set collection and scoring mechanism. My 11-year-old got the hang of things fairly early and has already found several good paths to victory when we play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d still recommend this one, just for slightly older players. The price is solid, and you’ll certain get a lot of value out of this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy Looting Atlantis was provided free for review by Shoot Again Games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Twin Flames</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My first-ever video game Kickstarter pick is Fat Panda Games’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://twinflamesgame.com&quot;&gt;Twin Flames&lt;/a&gt;. It’s actually not on Kickstarter yet but should be soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Fat Panda Games Website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Twin Flames is a 2D action platformer with roguelike elements to spice it up. You can play as either Joachim or Boaz, a pair of God &amp;gt;siblings who must fight for all eternity in order to bring balance and peace to the universe, whether they want to or not. However, you &amp;gt;have a time limit to do so, that means that you must be quick and fight your way trough hordes of monsters, lethal traps and a lot of &amp;gt;mystical mysteries in order to reach the top of the tower and become the ultimate God of Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/twinflames/characters.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Twin Flames Characters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love roguelike games, especially 2D platformers. That, combined with the pixel graphics, has me exceptionally excited by Twin Flames. Here’s to hoping it lives up to my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, the Kickstarter project isn’t live yet. Once it is I’ll update this post with the link. Until then you can head to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twinflamesgame.com&quot;&gt;Twin Flames&lt;/a&gt; site to sign up for email notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon Sun and Moon Alolan Diglett/Dugtrio, New Z-Moves and Ultra Beasts, Mystery Pokémon Revealed</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pokémon Sun and Moon are right around the corner, and The Pokémon Company has released some new info about the game today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is the Alolan variations of Diglett and Dugtrio, each with some fabulous hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/digdug.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Alolan Diglett/Dugtrio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Diglett&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Ground–Steel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mole Pokémon Alolan Diglett live near volcanic areas, so they have few places to hide themselves away. It’s said they developed the hairlike metallic whiskers which grow from the top of their heads as a survival mechanism for the hostile volcanic environment. Their whiskers enable them to sense surrounding areas without exposing their face above ground. Alolan Diglett can have the Tangling Hair Ability, which is a new Ability that no other Pokémon has previously had. With the Tangling Hair Ability, opponents that hit this Pokémon with a move that makes direct contact will have their speed lowered by 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Dugtrio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Ground–Steel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alolan Dugtrio is the evolved form of Alolan Diglett. Alolan Dugtrio’s whiskers grow throughout its life at a very slow rate, shining with a brilliance akin to that of golden hair. In the Alola region, this Pokémon is revered as an incarnation of the god of the land, and it’s treated with great importance. Removing any of this Pokémon’s whiskers is strictly prohibited. There is a superstitious belief that many Alolan Dugtrio come out of their burrows on a day when a volcano will erupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/ultrab.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Ultra Beasts&quot; /&gt;There have also been two new Ultra Beasts announced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UB-03 Lighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Ultra Beasts is known as UB-03 Lighting. More will be revealed during the players’ adventures around the Alola region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UB-05 Glutton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beast has an astounding appetite, and it will completely devour anything in front of its eyes. It’s said that it devours not only objects, but the ground, rivers, and even the seas. There is a belief that it converts the abnormal amount it eats entirely into energy to sustain itself, leaving no waste product behind. Whether this is true or not is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still not clear if Ultra Beasts are Pokémon or not. Clearly these two are a bit more horrific that we’re usually used to seeing, but it’s weird to think about any creature in the Pokémon world that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; a Pokémon in some way, shape, or form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we’ll have to wait until the 18th to see what’s really going on with Ultra Beasts. This doesn’t seem like a secret that they’re going to let slip before players actually experience the revelation in-game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/zmoves.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Z-Moves&quot; /&gt;The Z-Moves for all the final evolutions of the Starter Pokémon are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z-Move: Sinister Arrow Raid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon: Decidueye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decidueye slices through the air together with a hail of arrow quills, crashing into the target before dealing the final blow with its arrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z-Move: Oceanic Operetta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon: Primarina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarina manipulates a huge balloon using its voice, then causes it to explode over its target’s head, dealing a lot of damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z-Move: Malicious Moonsault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon: Incineroar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With flames spouting from its flame belt, Incineroar leaps high into the sky and dives straight down onto its target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z-Moves are special moves that a Pokémon can use when it’s holding a Z-Crystal that corresponds to its move’s type. Their effects vary greatly depending on whether they’re based on attack moves or status moves. Z-Moves based on attack moves have far greater power than standard moves, but how powerful they will be seems to depend on the power of the original move that a Z-Move is based on. Since Z-Moves are full-powered attacks, they also seem to be impossible to fully ward off with moves like Protect and Detect—they still do some damage. When you use your Z-Power based on a status move, it will be powered up with additional effects. These effects come in many varieties, including raising your own Pokémon’s stats, healing the next Pokémon to switch in and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is the announcement of a Mystery Pokémon. No other info has been provided except the following image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/mystery.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mystery Pokémon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Four ($)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;center&quot; href=&quot;http://www.marchforthgames.com/idevaffiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1_2_1_3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border:0px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.marchforthgames.com/idevaffiliate/media/banners/FOUR-Banner-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;728&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/four/box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Four Box&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;I hadn’t previously heard about March Forth Games until they reached out to me to do a review of their game, Four.  I took a quick look at their page while waiting for the game to come in, but there wasn’t much in-depth detail there. Once the game came in I was pleasantly surprised to find a fun, little, family team game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Four is for your team to earn four victory tokens. You do this by getting four of the same type of card in your hand and secretly notifying your teammate to claim the current victory token and declare that you have four of a kind. I’ll get more into this in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the game starts each team needs to come up with a secret signal to give each other. It can be verbal or non-verbal but must stay above the table. This comes into play later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of each round every player is given four cards. A victory token is placed in the center of all the players and then two cards are drawn from the deck and placed face up on the table. Gameplay is simultaneous with players taking the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swap a card on the table with one from their hand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play a special power&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Claim the victory token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swapping a card is pretty straight forward. If no player wants any of the cards on the table then the cards are discarded and two more are flipped in their place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing a special power during play usually involves trashing a card, then following its instructions. There are other types of special powers, but these are either used during scoring or have a passive effect. One thing to remember is that players must always draw back up to four cards in their hand if they’re left with less after trashing a card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last action a player can take is the most important. At any point in the game, a player can call “Four” and snag the token from the middle of the table. That player &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; then pick a player that they believe has four of a kind in their hand. Usually, it’s their own teammate who has given them their secret signal. Sometimes it’s another team’s player that was too obvious with their signal to their partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the player correctly guesses then their team earns that victory token. If they’re wrong, however, the other team gets the token. Special powers that effect scoring take place at this point. Once the token has been awarded all the cards are shuffled and a new round begins. The only exception is if both two players in a team have the Princess card. They’re allowed four minutes to secretly come up with a new signal before the game continues. The team who gets 4 tokens first is the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/four/cards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Four Cards&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Each card type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four is colorful, playful, and a real delight to the eye. The cards and tokens are sturdy and feel like they can withstand a lot of play before wearing out. The box that games comes in is equally sturdy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork for the different cards really stands out. Fun characters like the sneaky ninja, a shark with boxing gloves, and the stodgy gentleman all add an extra flair of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much to the game other than the deck and tokens, so it’s important that they’re top notch. March Forth Games comes through and delivers an excellent quality game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four is another game I was a bit skeptical about going into but had a real blast playing with my family. Coming up with the secret signal was half the fun. The frantic gameplay trying to snag cards, playing special powers, then trying to get your teammate to actually look at you while frantically giving your secret signal was hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also pretty great when you noticed the other team trying to notify their partner with their signal, and failing miserably. The satisfaction of snagging the token out from under their nose and calling them out for having four of a kind is pretty satisfying, though a bit nasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man. I’m a pretty bad dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a lot of laughs playing Four, and the kids immediately wanted to play again after our first game. They’re actually playing right now as I’m writing this, trying to get their 2-year-old brother as a fourth player. They’re not having much luck, but they’re all laughing their heads off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Four was provided by March Forth Games for unboxing and review. This is a commission paid product posting based on the game’s sale through A Pawn’s Perspective referral.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Party Hard: High Crimes, New Twitch Integration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/partyhard/highcrimes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;High Crimes&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/356570/&quot;&gt;Party Hard&lt;/a&gt; has some new DLC, new Twitch integration features, and an iOS and Google Play builds coming out tomorrow. This is great news for those who have played through the main game and are looking for a bit more out of the excellent, quirky, slasher game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new story DLC, High Crimes, takes place 10 years after the main game and features a new mini-story campaign with large, scrolling levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates to the main game include local co-op, a new original sound tack that’s Youtube-safe, and a new Twitch system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Twitch system allows Twitch chat users to control NPCs during the game. Users can earn points to perform different actions from the following list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 / 2 / 3&lt;/strong&gt; – enables voting on Twitch Events, users earn +5 points for every vote&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;say&lt;/strong&gt; – allows users to say things within the game, costs -30 points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;get badge [badge number]&lt;/strong&gt; – get a badge next to their username in the in-game UI. Users can choose which badge they’d like, for example “Get Badge 12”  will grant them badge number 12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;points&lt;/strong&gt; – shows a user their points balance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getchar&lt;/strong&gt; – take control of an NPC on-screen (costs -50 points), you will then be able to give them the following commands:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kill&lt;/strong&gt; – attempt to kill the player (costs -300 points)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pick [coordinate number]&lt;/strong&gt; – allows the NPCs to pick up points scattered through the level, for example there might be a coin on “p123”, meaning the full command to pick that up is “pick p123”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;move [coordinate number]&lt;/strong&gt; – move to a point on the map, same as pick&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;killrandom&lt;/strong&gt; – kill a random NPC on-screen (costs -50)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;follow&lt;/strong&gt; – follow the player (-50)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bribe&lt;/strong&gt; – bribe the cops to go away, After every successful bribe, the minimum amount will grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game, while twisted, is an excellent time. I’m looking forward to giving the new additions a try.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Four ($)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;center&quot; href=&quot;http://www.marchforthgames.com/idevaffiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1_2_1_3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border:0px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.marchforthgames.com/idevaffiliate/media/banners/FOUR-Banner-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;728&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marchforthgames.com/idevaffiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt; is a new, team-based card game by March Forth Games. It’s a chaotic game where teams of players ages 8+ can enjoy an easy-to-learn rule set and a quick 20 minute play time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March Forth sent me a copy to review so I figured I’d do a quick unboxing before I did so. There’s not much in the box except cards and tokens. Thanks to a small deck size I was able to take a picture of every card type in the deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/four/box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Four Box&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Four was provided by March Forth Games for unboxing and review. This is a commission paid product posting based on the game’s sale through A Pawn’s Perspective referral.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Gigamons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gigamons/gigamons.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Gigamons&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure most of us have grown up playing Memory. It’s a classic kids’ game that’s being playing in hundreds of thousands of households even to this day. Gigamons takes the Memory mechanic and adds a bit more gameplay to it. It’s a kids’ game through-and-through, but certainly improves on a tried-and-true formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game starts off with a shuffle of all the Elemon tiles. Then a 3x3 grid of tiles is placed face down on the table and play begins. Players take turns trying to make matches. If a match isn’t made then the turn moves to the player on the left. If a match &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; made then the player who made the match takes the tiles for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Gigamons gets a bit interesting is that each of the Elemon types has a special power. When a match is made a special power is triggered. Some of the powers including taking another turn, take a tiling from the top of the tile stack, peeping at some of the tiles on the board, or placing a boulder on top of a tile on the board so it can’t be flipped until your next turn. There’s even an Elemon, Polymon, who’s power is that it can be matched with any other Elemon, but that match doesn’t trigger the other Elemon’s power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tiles take from the board are then replaced with ones from the tile stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a player has three of an Elemon type in front of them they can summon that type’s Gigamon by discarding the set. The first player to get 3 Gigamons wins the game. It should be noted that Gigamons can be stolen by other players who create that Gigamon’s matching set of Elemons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork is Gigamons is friendly, colorful, and cute. The larger-than-life Gigamons, while fairly useless other than a scoring mechanism, are excellent quality and fun to look at/hold. Tiles are thick, easy to pick up, and sturdy. My only real complaint here is the shape of the box. I’m really not a fan of non-standard boxes, and while the flat bottom stands easily enough I’m just not digging the otherwise rounded shape. This in no way, shape, or form affects the gameplay, but it’s a gripe nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/featured/gigamons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gigamons Pieces&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Cute and cuddly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids and I really had a great time with Gigamons, and it’s hit the table multiple times already. My kids are such big fans of the game that my 6-year-old picked it out at our local toy store to bring as a gift to his friend’s birthday party this past weekend. To me, that’s a great indicator of how much my little guy enjoys this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Orange never seems to fail to create fun and memorable family games, and at around $15-$17, you can’t go wrong snagging this one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Humble Mobile Bundle is Full of Board Games</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with Humble Bundles, they’re bundles of items (usually digital) that are sold on a pay-what-you-like basis with money going to charity. The program has grown tremendously over the years with multiple bundles being offered at a time with different themes. One of the more popular bundles, the mobile bundle, focuses on apps for Android and iOS. This time around it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/mobile/board-games-mobile-bundle&quot;&gt;Board Game bundle&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s chock full of awesome games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay at least $1 and you get Carcassonne and Scotland Yard. $3 or more gets you Splendor, Catan, and The aMAZEing Labryinth. $5 or more unlocks the whole bundle, adding Ticket to Ride, San Juan, and Galaxy Trucker. In typical Humble Bundle fashion you can expect more games to be unlocked in the future and automatically added on to your order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bundle supports both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/&quot;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.childsplaycharity.org/&quot;&gt;Child’s Play Charity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not going to get a better deal on mobile board games than this and you can feel good knowing the money will go to a great cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can snag this excellent bundle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/mobile/board-games-mobile-bundle&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Yeti</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yeti/box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yeti Box&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dice rolling to hunt down the elusive Yeti, that’s what AEG’s Yeti is all about. Roll the dice, gain points, coins, sherpas, tents, or even trigger a blizzard. Purchase new equipment, snap pictures of the yeti, camp out on the mountain, and try to catch up to the elusive beast before anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeti comes in a big box, but that’s mostly to house its assembled components. It’s simple to learn, and a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Yeti each player is trying to earn enough points to make their way along the score track and catch up to the yeti figure places on there. Each player’s turn is broken up into 5 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll the dice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set aside snow dice rolled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set aside 1 type of die (mandatory is no snow was rolled, optional if snow was rolled)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat 1-3 until all dice have been set aside&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluate dice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snow is the first thing you’re going to look at when evaluating your dice. Roll less than 3 and nothing happens. Roll exactly 3 and you can change one to any side you want. Rolling more than 3 is when the poop hits the fan, as this triggers a blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a blizzard is triggered the yeti moves forward on the score track a specific number of spaces depending on the number of players. This essentially makes him harder to catch up with. As an aside, the Yeti can never move past a player token. Next, you place any number of snow dice exceeding 3 on your reference card. These are out of the game until your next turn. Finally, you change one of the remaining three snow dice to any face you want and continue evaluating your dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coins are a one-shot currency to buy anything on the photo track. You can buy a photo for it’s listed cost and immediately earn as many victory points that are listed on that level. Alternatively, you can buy equipment tiles. Certain items are one-use-only while others provide a bonus to you throughout the game. You can only make one purchase on your turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherpas let you climb the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Sherpa lets you ascend 1 level.&lt;br /&gt;
3 Sherpa let you ascend 2 levels.&lt;br /&gt;
6 Sherpa let you ascend 3 levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing the mountain earns you bonuses on any footprints you roll. There’s also a bonus waiting for the first person to make it to the top, and lower bonuses for every other person who makes it up there. At the end of your turn, you return back to base camp unless you have rolled tents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tents allow you to start your next turn at a certain level, providing you’re already on the mountain. You can never climb the mountain using tents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Tent: Your Mountaineer makes camp on level 1.&lt;br /&gt;
2 Tents: Your Mountaineer makes camp on level 2.&lt;br /&gt;
3 Tents: Your Mountaineer makes camp the peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly one of the most important die faces, is the footprint. You get a certain number of victory points per footprint rolled depending where on the mountain you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Base Camp: You receive 1 Victory Point per Footprint.&lt;br /&gt;
Level 1: You receive 2 Victory Points per Footprint.&lt;br /&gt;
Level 2: You receive 3 Victory Points per Footprint.&lt;br /&gt;
Peak: You receive 4 Victory Points per Footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final round is triggered when one person lands on or overtakes the yeti on the score track. After that final round, the person with the more victory points wins. Ties are decided with equipment values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that Yeti includes Weather Tiles for a variation on the game. Three good tiles are shuffled in among bad weather tiles. Each turn a new weather tile is drawn and its effects are applied to that turn. It can make for a slightly longer game but adds a nice element to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production value on Yeti is great. The cardboard is thick and durable. The meeples are smooth, evenly painted, and mine had no blemishes at all. The 3D board is a nice touch, goes together easily, and can actually be stored in the box without having to take apart the mountain peak. The dice, while wooden, feel great, roll great. and seem to roll fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork is top notch, comical, and kid friendly. The yeti is more friendly looking than anything. All the icons and game text are clear, easily readable and recognizable, and help keep the game moving along with little-to-no confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised the cost of the game is as low as it is considering what you get in the box and the quality of every game piece. Though really I expect no less from AEG at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/yeti/board.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yeti Board&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Impressive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When AEG says that YETI is for ages 14+ they must joking. My 6-year-old had no trouble learning the rules and handing my ass to me in a 30-minute gaming session. The whole family (minus my 2-year-old) got in on this one and had a blast. It’s lighter fare, but there’s enough here to keep it interesting. More serious gamers might not find much here for them, but then again I doubt many heavy-Euro players are really paying much attention to AEG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeti proves to be another excellent title in AEG’s lineup, and a great game to play on family game night. While I still may take Smashup of Fantazee over it, I don’t doubt this will be hitting the table quite a bit as my kids really love the board and ease of play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeti was provided free for review by AEG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Attack on Titan Deckbuilding Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cryptozoic’s Attack on Titan Deckbuilding Game is hitting shelves soon, and the wildly popular anime’s license will no doubt move units off the shelves. I haven’t had a chance to play it yet but it’s one it’s one I’m looking forward too. I didn’t snap a pic of every card in the box, but these images should give you a fairly good idea of what you’re getting into with Cryptozoic’s latest Cerberus engine game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that the hero Hange is only available in the first printing of the game as a promo. This brings the total number of heroes to 8, instead of the 7 listed on the back of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Yeti</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;AEG is on a hot streak with games recently and Yeti doesn’t look to be an exception. Aimed at families, it has a 3D board that you build before you play and comes in at 20-40 minutes of game time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I normally just take pictures of the components straight out of the box, I couldn’t help but put the board together to snap some pics of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything here looks top notch, and I can’t wait to get the game to the table with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Warlock's Tower is a Gameboy Throwback</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-vVddyXUPbg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by Brazilian indie studio Midipixel, Warlock’s Tower is an aural and visual tribute to the wonderful Nintendo Game Boy. It will arrive in Jan 2017 on Steam, iOS, and Android. 3DS and Vita releases will follow shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warlock’s Tower is a puzzle game with over 100 rooms, each harder to solve than the last. The gimmick here is that every step you take diminishes your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video above is enough to get my nostalgic juices flowing. The game can’t come out fast enough and I’m hoping to get a preview build of it soon for review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wizardstower/screens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Warlock's Tower Screens&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Looks like the good ‘ol days&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Hex Casters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hex Casters is one of the first games released by Hasbro that was funded through Indiegogo. It’s a party game for 3-6 players where players are trying to hex each other and protect themselves from other players. Hexes are pretty crazy, as you can see in the cards below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get a picture of every card in the game, so everything you see here is exactly what’s in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be getting this one to the table soon, so hopefully I’ll also have a review up soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Avoid the Void</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/04/pax-east-2016-avoid-the-void-by-geek-fever-games/&quot;&gt;huge fan&lt;/a&gt; of Avoid the Void and was really bummed when the Kickstarter campaign for the game fell short. Thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekfevergames.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.geekfevergames.com/&lt;/a&gt; didn’t give up, and crowdfunded the game through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/avoid-the-void?&quot;&gt;The Game Crafter&lt;/a&gt;. My copy finally arrived, and I couldn’t be happier. Now I can enjoy galaxy destroying fun with my kids!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always love to see how far the quality has come with Game Crafter games. Here’s a look at what you get in the box:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Mystic Vale: Vale of Magic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously I’ve unboxed&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and reviewed&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; AEG’s Mystic Vale. Now I’ve gotten my hands on its first expansion, Vale of Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion contains 54 advancement cards, 18 new vales, and the rulebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to get one of each new advancement type and vale in their respective pictures. Other than that it’s just the box and rulebook cover. The rulebook contains no actual new rules, just summaries of the new advancement and vales. All you need to do is shuffle the new cards in and play.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon Sun and Moon Starter Final Evolutions. Also, Red and Blue!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company International and Nintendo showcased the final evolutions of Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon, along with the Alolan Guardians and a few other new Pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/starterevs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Starter Final Evolutions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decidueye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Grass/Ghost&lt;/strong&gt;
The Arrow Quill Pokémon Decidueye is the fully evolved form of the Grass- and Flying-type first-partner Pokémon Rowlet. Decidueye attacks with astonishing speed, plucking arrow quills from its wings to send them hurtling towards its target with precise aim. This Pokémon is able to move about whilst completely masking its presence from others. Decidueye is the only Pokémon that can learn the move Spirit Shackle. This new Ghost-type move hits an opponent and makes it unable to leave the battle—it can’t flee or switch out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primarina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Water/Fairy&lt;/strong&gt;
The Soloist Pokémon Primarina is the fully evolved form of the Water-type first-partner Pokémon Popplio. As Primarina dances, it releases balloons of water and controls their movement using the sound waves from its voice. Primarina uses some of these balloons to jump on and maneuver in battle whilst others explode when touched, which can trigger chained explosions. Primarina is the only Pokémon that can learn Sparkling Aria, a new Water-type special move which heals the burns of any target it strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incineroar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Fire/Dark&lt;/strong&gt;
The Heel Pokémon Incineroar is the fully evolved form of the Fire-type first-partner Pokémon Litten. As Incineroar’s fighting spirit increases, the flames it produces within its body burst from its navel and waistline. These flames resemble a championship belt, which it uses to unleash its moves. Incineroar is the only Pokémon able to learn the move Darkest Lariat. This new Dark-type physical attack allows Incineroar to deal damage to an enemy whilst ignoring the effects of any stat changes on that enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/cosmog.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Cosmog&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cosmog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Psychic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nebula Pokémon Cosmog is extremely rare, known only to a select few across Alola. Named by the Aether Foundation, Cosmog is very curious, and its gaseous body is so lightweight that it’s sent flying when the wind blows. When light falls on the Pokémon, Cosmog can absorb it and grow bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/alolanpersian.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Alolan Persian&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Persian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Dark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alolan Persian is highly intelligent and doesn’t like to grow attached to its Trainer, making it something of a difficult Pokémon to have as a battle partner. The round face of Alolan Persian is a symbol of the rich Alola region, and it is held to be a Pokémon of great beauty. Its exquisite coat shines with the glow of high quality and enchants both humans and Pokémon. For this reason, it is a very popular Pokémon in the Alola region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/guardians.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guardians&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tapu Lele&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Psychic/Fairy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tapu Lele is the guardian deity of Akala island. This Pokémon scatters glowing scales that have physical effects on others—providing stimulation to their bodies and healing their illnesses or injuries. Tapu Lele has the Ability Psychic Surge, an Ability that no other Pokémon has previously had. With Psychic Surge, the field will be turned into Psychic Terrain, which boosts the power of any Psychic-type moves used by Pokémon on the ground and prevents them from being hit by priority moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tapu Bulu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Grass/Fairy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tapu Bulu is the guardian deity of Ula’ula Island. This Pokémon has the power to manipulate vegetation and cause it to grow. It can use this power to make its wooden horns change shape and grow larger. Tapu Bulu has the Ability Grassy Surge, an Ability that no other Pokémon has previously had. With Grassy Surge, the field will be turned into Grassy Terrain, boosting the power of any Grass-type moves used by Pokémon on the ground and restoring a bit of HP to them each turn. It also halves the damage taken from the moves Earthquake, Magnitude and Bulldoze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tapu Fini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Water/Fairy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tapu Fini is the guardian deity of Poni Island. This Pokémon is able to attack by manipulating water. It does not like to risk being harmed during battle, so it creates a thick fog to disorient its opponents and lead them to their own destruction. Tapu Fini has the Ability Misty Surge, an Ability that no other Pokémon has previously had. With Misty Surge, the field will be turned into Misty Terrain, halving the damage taken by Pokémon on the ground from Dragon-type moves and preventing them from being afflicted with status conditions or confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the guardian deities can use the special Z-Move Guardian of Alola. When using this Z-Move, the Pokémon closes its shell and a huge avatar appears from the ground to attack the opposing Pokémon, dealing damage equal to 75 percent of the target’s remaining HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/redblue.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Cosmog&quot; /&gt;That’s not all the news, though! We all know there’s no Pokémon League in Alola yet, but it seems that there’s plans to construct one at the peak of a mountain. After your major achievement in completing the island challenge, will the day come when you also take on the Pokémon League to become the strongest Pokémon Trainer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest news, in my opinon, is that of the Battle Tree. It’s a place where Trainers who have completed their island challenge, or who are strong enough to have done so, battle one another. You can scout an opponent you’ve battled against so they can partner and fight alongside you in future battles. You may even see some familiar faces, including the Trainers &lt;em&gt;Red and Blue&lt;/em&gt; (looking a bit older) from the Kanto region! There’s not indication if the two will have any part of the story, or will just be in the game to battle. What teams will each have? I’m guessing ones similar to their teams in Pokémon Origins and Pokémon Generations. Could we see other famous trainers? I sure hope so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new trailer that showcases the new Pokémon and characters can be found below. It’s always nice to see the high res images come through, but seeing everything in action is always exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we get closer to release I’ll keep posting information as it comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interactive Audio World of Darkness Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ear-play.com&quot;&gt;Earplay&lt;/a&gt; before today. Earplay is currently available as a skill on Alexa Enabled devices, and enables you to play games via voice and audio on said devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earplay and White Wolf today announced a new partnership to create a full length interactive audio experience scheduled to release this winter through Alexa and iOS. This will be the first immersive digital experience set in the World of Darkness universe. A free interactive audio teaser titled “The Orpheus Device” will be available soon through signup in the Earplay Alexa skill and in November in the Earplay iOS App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orpheus Device is written and designed by Dave Grossman (Day of the Tentacle, The Wolf Among Us) and game writer Richard Dansky (The Division), the original developer of the Wraith tabletop game (my favorite WoD setting.) Players will hear the story, interact with the characters, and become immersed in the narrative through this exciting new medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we are developing the World of Darkness it is very inspiring to work with Earplay about how to bring our universe into the new medium of interactive audio storytelling,” said White Wolf CEO Tobias Sjögren. “The way you can now interact with a story fits the Wraith brand extremely well and we think Earplay has a unique ability to make an immersive experience for the players,” said White Wolf Lead Storyteller Martin Ericsson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teaser should be available on Halloween and has the player conversing with a Wraith by using their Alexa enabled device as an Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) device built by the ghost hunting organization Orpheus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a World of Darkness property, it’s safe to say it’s not suitable for children.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Acquire</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire&quot;&gt;Acquire&lt;/a&gt; has changed hands quite a bit in its history. It’s been in the hands of Hasbro since 1999 when they first published it under their newly-acquires (pun intended) Avalon Hill brand. Acquire has gone from a more functional to a more visually pleasing transition over the years, but the basic gameplay has stayed the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Hasbro has a new version on the market that has its own unique look and feel to it. It’s very minimal, yet still striking. Very plastic/cheap cardstock, but not to much detriment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look for yourself and see how you feel about it. Then go out and snag it because it’s the cheapest you’ll find this classic game that deserves a spot on every gamer’s shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anima: Gate of Memories Coming to Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qtr_zWXos_c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve never played any of the Anima tabletop games, I’ve always admired the art style of them. To be more specific, the crazy weapons. A while back ago BadLand Games kickstarted a video game adaptation of Anima called Anima: Gate of Memories. It’s an action RPG that has a very similar feel to games like Devil May Cry where you’re creating huge combos to take down hordes of baddies. I haven’t tried it, but it looks like I may be soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of June the game has been available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/380750/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; for the PC, Xbox One, and PS4. Come October 28th Mac users will be able to snag and play the game from Steam as well. The reviews are mixed, so I’m holding off judgment until I actually get my hands on the game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Smiths of Winterforge</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allofthed/smiths-of-winterforge-a-game-for-2-5-dwarven-black&quot;&gt;Smiths of Winterforge&lt;/a&gt; is currently up for funding on Kickstarter. I’ll actually have a review of the game going up soon on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;, most likely this Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I have to say, and what you’re about to see, is that this is one of the best prototypes I’ve ever received. While it’s not the final product, it looks &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; close. As for the rest, you’ll need to wait for my review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, you can check out more about the game on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/allofthed/smiths-of-winterforge-a-game-for-2-5-dwarven-black&quot;&gt;Kickstarter page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Storyline Scary Tales</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/05/second-look-storyline-fairy-tales/&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Storyline-Unboxing/&quot;&gt;unboxed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ABYSWP4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01ABYSWP4&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=pawnsperspect-20&amp;amp;linkId=8529a8350c86f5f6da37a8274cdfeffb&quot;&gt;Storyline: Fairy Tales&lt;/a&gt;. Now Asmodee has released Storyline: Scarytales just in time for Halloween. It’s the same game, just spookier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Fairy Tales you’re getting 2 tales and over 100 cards. As is expected, you can combine both games to make even crazier stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t take as many shots of the game as I did the first one. Just enough to get an idea of how to new artwork, cards, and tokens look.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon: The First Movie Back in Theaters for Two Days.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pokémon movie will be shown at over 200 Cinemark theaters on Saturday, October 29, and Tuesday, November 1. The movie will run with the “Pikachu’s Vacation” short. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cinemark.com/pokemon-the-first-movie&quot;&gt;preorder tickets&lt;/a&gt; now for $5, which may be a good idea since I have a feeling shows will sell out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with the movie, and it’s tear jerker climax scene, it features Ash and Pikachu as they face off against the Legendary Pokémon Mewtwo. Mewtwo, furious at the humans who created him, clones Pokémon to create his own army for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Fone Bone 4-Inch Vinyl Figure</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bone/boneville.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bone Cover&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Jeff Smith’s Bone is the winner of 11 Harvey awards and 10 Eisner awards, including best cartoonist and best humor publication. It’s also been named the best comic book by the National Cartoonists Society.  Fone Bone, the series main protagonist is a widely recognized character and Cryptozoic has perfectly captured his likeness in a 4” vinyl figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fone Bone isn’t really meant for play. The figure is a collectible on a stand and is purely meant for display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wonder how well a character like Fone Bone will translate to the 3D world. He’s not very realistic, and while he looks great in the Bone comics, that doesn’t mean he’d look great taken from the pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s really nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptozoic has done an excellent job taking the character and faithfully reproducing him as a physical, collectible figure. It’s almost like they just plucked him off the cover of Out from Boneville and put him on a stand. Everything about this 4” vinyl figure seems to be a product of care and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bone/fone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fone Bone&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Straight from the page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Bone. It’s a great series, and Fone Bone is an excellent character. That being said, I had no idea what to expect from this figure. I’m more than pleased with how well it’s made, and I love seeing it on display in my office. The price can’t be beat either. At $25 you’re getting a pretty good sized figure. While 4” may not seem too large, you’ll be quite surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a Bone fan there’s no passing this figure up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Fone Bone 4” Vinyl figure was provided free for review by Cryptozoic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Supporting Links&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>New Pokémon and Characters revealed for Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s start this post off with some new Pokémon that were announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/moarpokemans.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Pokémon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silvally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Synthetic Pokémon Silvally is the evolution of Type: Null. This Pokémon changes its type when exclusive items are inserted into the drive on its head, and its somatic cells mutate and glow with different colors of light depending on its type. Silvally has the new Ability RKS System, which causes this Pokémon to change type when holding specific type-related items. It also has the exclusive move Multi-Attack, an attack which changes depending on which type-related item it is holding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;akamo-o&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Dragon-Fighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hakamo-o is the Evolution of Jangmo-o. Hakamo-o dance before battle to show their strength, clanging their scales together. A solitary Pokémon that enjoys training alone, its scales are often torn off, but they grow back nearly immediately. Hakamo-o view the number of lost scales as proof of how ferociously they have fought in battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kommo-o&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Dragon-Fighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kommo-o is the Evolution of Hakamo-o. There is a legend that says Kommo-o are covered in glittering scales in order to drive away a great darkness covering the world. This Pokémon can learn the new move Clanging Scales. When using this attack, Kommo-o scrapes the scales covering its body against one another, attacking with a loud clamor. After using this move, Kommo-o’s Defense is lowered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steenee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Grass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fruit Pokémon Steenee is the Evolution of Bounsweet. The calyx on this Pokémon’s head is very hard, and Steenee attacks by smacking its opponent with it, combined with kicks from its tough legs. This Pokémon’s fragrance is even more delectable than that of Bounsweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tsareena&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Grass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the strongest of Steenee are able to evolve into Tsareena. A very noble Pokémon, Tsareena use their strength to protect and rule over Bounsweet as their queen. This Pokémon attacks with very powerful, majestic kicks and uses its powerful fragrance to mesmerize its opponents. Some Tsareena have the exclusive new ability Queenly Majesty, which prevents opponents from using priority moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ribombee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Bug-Fairy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ribombee is the Evolution of Cutiefly. This Pokémon collects flower nectar and pollen to make into balls, known as Pollen Puffs, which it can then launch at its opponent in battle. Some of the Pollen Puffs that Ribombee make also have relaxing effects or can relieve tiredness. These Pollen Puffs are distributed all over the Alola region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been some new Alolan variation Pokémon announced, too. This time it’s Alolan Grimer and Muk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Grimer/Muk&quot; src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/grimermuk.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Grimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Poison-Dark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the population of the Alola region increased, dealing with garbage became a serious problem. As a solution, Grimer were imported from other regions and fed primarily on garbage, so their body composition changed—as did their form. What appear to be teeth in this Pokémon’s mouth are in fact residual toxins from the garbage it eats, which have hardened and crystallized. There are more than a hundred Alolan Grimer in Alola’s garbage-processing plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Muk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Poison-Dark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alolan Muk evolves from Alolan Grimer. The Muk in the Alola region produce and store their toxins within their bodies so, unlike Muk in other regions, you won’t detect any unpleasant aromas when you draw near one. Alolan Muk has the same poisonous crystals as Alolan Grimer, but they are all over the surface of its body. Alolan Muk uses them to attack, just like other Pokémon use their fangs or claws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is the announcement of some new characters in the Pokémon world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olivia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivia is the kahuna of Akala Island, the second island you visit across your island challenge. She is extraordinarily skilled and has served as a kahuna since a young age. Although highly skilled, she insists that she is just a normal girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ilima&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graduate of the Trainers’ school and an expert in Normal-type Pokémon, Captain Ilima is considered a hero by the students of his former school.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Out There: Ω Edition Free on Amazon Underground</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Out There: Ω Edition, the rougelike sci-fi that inspired Out There Chronicles, is currently free on &lt;a href=&quot;http://miclos.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=0342687b8b29c92bc2a5ab0a3&amp;amp;id=9bbc5836e5&amp;amp;e=c0f8783cab&quot;&gt;Amazon Underground&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Out There you are an astronaut awaking from cryonics not in the solar system, but… out there… in a far and unknown place of the galaxy. In Out There, you will have to survive, tinkering your ship with what you can gather drifting in the void, and spot garden planets to refill your oxygen supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of Out There Chronicles, and will be giving this one a shot as soon as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To snag the game you’ll first need to install the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miclos.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0342687b8b29c92bc2a5ab0a3&amp;amp;id=4f3be2def5&amp;amp;e=c0f8783cab&quot;&gt;Amazon Underground App&lt;/a&gt; on your Android device. Once that’s done just install &lt;a href=&quot;http://miclos.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0342687b8b29c92bc2a5ab0a3&amp;amp;id=f1287fabb7&amp;amp;e=c0f8783cab&quot;&gt;Out There&lt;/a&gt; from the Underground app and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Safari Ltd Behemoth and Crystal Cavern Dragon</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/safaritoys/howisafari.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How I Safari&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Safari Ltd has always put out quality toys. I always remember seeing their stuff in museum gift shops, zoos, craft shops, and more. I even had a few of their dinosaur, wildlife, and marine toys on my dresser in my bedroom as a kid. Over the years their catalog has grown and I’ve become more and more interested in their fantasy lines. Today I’ll be looking at their new Behemoth and Crystal Cave&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these toys are made for play. They’re rugged, have a great heft to them, and feel great in the hands. Their size makes them perfect for pretend play. Not too small as to get lost and stepped on. Not too large where you can’t get a good on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no moving parts any of the Safari figures. These aren’t action figures. That doesn’t make them any less fun, as my kids have already proved. They enter imaginative play with all the other toys scattered around our house seamlessly. My original plans were to incorporate these into some D&amp;amp;D campaign, but I don’t think I’ll be able to take them back from my kids at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/safaritoys/behemothown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Behemoth&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Large and in charge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation of these toys is key. Safari Ltd toys generally don’t have any packaging. The toys are put out on a shelf, or laid out in a box, with just a Safari Ltd tag around their neck or body. The same is true with the Behemoth and Crystal Cave Dragon. The toys speak for themselves with no other advertising other than their beautiful sculpts and paint jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crystal Cave Dragon is colorful and stands 4 ½ inches tall and is 5 inches long. The paint job gives it a prismatic, almost shimmery, look. It stands on 4 legs but also has two arms. Its long, slender neck ends in an inquisitive, non-threatening, head and face. There’s nothing scary about this Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Behemoth is a pretty stark contrast to the Dragon. It’s shorter, squat, and ferocious. Its 5-inch-long body is littered with scars and its color scheme is much darker, grittier, and earthy. The beady red eyes are set in a squarish head filled with rows of different sized teeth. The Behemoth is on all fours, but the front two appendages are more like arms/hands. The whole figure ends with a stout, spine covered tail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/safaritoys/crystaldragonown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crystal Cave Dragon&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Beautifully painted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved to stuff Safari puts out. Seeing their wares in the store always brings back memories of trips to the New York Museum of Natural History gift shop or those of zoos and aquariums. These two figures sent over are both great and I hope to add much more from the dragon and mythical realms lines to my collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Behemoth and Crystal Cave Dragon are both well suited for play or collecting. Priced at $14.99 and $11.99 respectively, they also won’t break the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Behemoth and Crystal Cave Dragon were provided by Safari Toys for review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Hasbro's Beyblade Burst</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got some samples in of Hasbro’s new Beyblade Burst Beys. These are currently already out in Canada and will be in on US shelves in January of 2017. So far I like what I see with the exceptions of the launchers and stadiums. I’ll soon post some video of the Beys in action, but until there here’re some shots of the actual Beys themselves. I’ve also included a pic of the Hasbro launcher next to the far superior Takara Tomy launcher, and a shot of some of the new Hasbro wheels above their Takara Tomy counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the Beys look really great. There are no sticker sheets in the packages, so all the detail is painted right on the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with videos that I’ll be posting here, I’ll also have a full review up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fone Bone 4-Inch Vinyl Figure</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bone/bone.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fone Bone&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hobby store shelves got a bit more exciting lately with the release of Cryptozoic’s Fone Bone 4” Vinyl Figure figure. For those unfamiliar, Fone Bone is the original protagonist of the classic Bone graphic novels by Jeff Smith. Fone is short, but brave, and the most courageous of his cousins in the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fone Bone’s sculpt is straight from the original cover for the first volume of Bone, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439706408/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0439706408&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=pawnsperspect-20&amp;amp;linkId=7a2b2f9cba55cc0876b71705e9167d27&quot;&gt;Out from Boneville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=pawnsperspect-20&amp;amp;l=am2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0439706408&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - A.E.G.I.S.</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gbg/aegis-combining-robot-strategy-game/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had taken a look at an early prototype &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2014/06/second-looka-e-g-i-s-arc-buster-starter-set/&quot;&gt;A.E.G.I.S.&lt;/a&gt; over at Purple Pawn a few years back while Zephyr Workshop was still working on the game. Now Greenbrier has picked up the game and currently has it up on Kickstarter. It’s my first Kickstarter pick for October, and it’s a game I’m really excited about. I enjoyed the game when I first tried it and now it looks more polished and perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t doubt A.E.G.I.S. will be funded, so make sure you get at least a $40 pledge in for one of two starter sets. The stretch goals are hidden for now, but I’m sure there are more robots, and possibly miniatures, in those somewhere. Unfortunately, the $200 tier is all gone, so if you were looking for a chance to become a permanent part of the Zephyr team you’re out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still have the original prototype Zephyr sent me, I should be getting one for the Greenbrier version in the next month or so. Once I do I’ll make sure to update my review over on Purple Pawn.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon Demo Drops Oct 18</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon Special Demo Version will be available to download from the Nintendo eShop on October 18th. The Special Demo Version introduces players to the Alola region and features Ash-Greninja, the Pokémon that appears alongside the hero Ash in the animated TV series Pokémon the Series: XYZ. Players will be able to transfer their Ash-Greninja from the Special Demo Version to their full version of Pokémon Sun or Pokémon Moon once purchased when the games launch on November 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also announced was the Festival Plaza. Players will be able to see other people playing near them, or other players that are connected to the internet to battle or trade. By talking to people and listening to their requests in Festival Plaza, players can receive Festival Coins. There are cool stores to spend Festival Coins in, such as dye houses, goody shops (where rare items are obtained) and even bouncy castles for Pokémon to train in. As players gather more Festival Coins, their Festival Plaza will rank up, yielding rewards and making more activities available. Players will even gain the ability to host missions, where multiple players can work together to try to achieve certain goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that was announced was Poké Pelago. In Poké Pelago, Pokémon that are stored in a PC Box can explore a variety of isles, play on athletic equipment and enjoy other fun activities. If players send many Pokémon to Poké Pelago, they can develop more facilities on the isles and also develop new kinds of isles. As these isles are developed and increase in number, they will allow players to obtain items and even raise Pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some of the most exciting new news, the first evolutions for each of the starter Pokémon have been released. Though leaked a while ago, it’s nice to have confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/starter2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Torracat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fire Cat Pokémon Torracat evolves from Litten. This Pokémon produces flames for its attacks from a bell-like sac attached at the base of its throat. Torracat has a great love for battle and will attack relentlessly. Its mane can sense what is going on around it, even in the dark, and is able to detect the presence of hidden enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brionne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pop Star Pokémon Brionne evolves from Popplio. Brionne can dance in perfect time with others and is always cheery and positive. A very hard worker, Brionne learns dances by imitating other members of its colony and can sometimes even learn dances from humans. As this Pokémon dances, it creates balloons and slaps them into its target, making them explode and deal damage to its opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dartrix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Grass-Flying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blade Quill Pokémon Dartrix evolves from Rowlet. Dartrix attacks by throwing its knife-edged feathers, and it possesses extremely sharp senses. This Pokémon can detect opponents behind it and can throw feathers to strike them without even seeing them. This Pokémon cares a great deal about its appearance, grooming its feathers in every spare moment it has.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - The Warlock of Firetop Mountain</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/firetop/firetop.png&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; alt=&quot;Cover&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;Back in 1984 Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone released the first of many Fighting Fantasy books, a popular series of solo adventures. This first book was The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, originally published by Puffin Books.  Its overwhelming success paved the way for the more than 50 Fighting Fantasy books that followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s available on Steam as a full, interactive tabletop adventure thanks to Tin Man Games, a studio that’s adapted eight Fighting Fantasy books already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain plays like a choose-your-own-adventure game, with bouts of miniatures combat tossed in here and there. As you progress through the dungeon you’ll be asked which directions you’d like to go a crossroads, if you want to attack or sneak by a monster, if you’d like to open a chest or ignore it, and other such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual adventure is fairly short, but there’s multiple paths to take, multiple characters to play as, and a bunch more characters to unlock. It’s also unforgiving. Most of the time you’ll have to start over if you die, though once you’ve played through a few times you’ll most likely start following a similar pattern each time you play (find the meat, sneak past the goblin, give the dogs the meat to bypass them, spring the trap in the chest, etc…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VE8OhYrkYoA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the writing and presentation of Warlock are where the game really shines. Your character is represented by a tabletop miniature, and all the miniatures have been digitally scanned in from Otherworld Miniatures line of figurines. Most of the artwork is the original Russ Nicholson illustrations with extra stuff added in for this edition. It’s a throwback to the 80’s, and really took me back. The writing is pretty much straight from the book, is immersive, and also incredibly 80’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a bit frustrating at first, The Warlock of Firetop Mountain retains the feel of the Fighting Fantasy books and became really enjoyable once I got the hang of things. Tin Man Games really did a great job translating this into a digital format, and you can tell a lot of hard work and care went into the game to provide the most authentic experience possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At $20 on Steam it’s a great game for people familiar with the old adventure books, or those who loved fantasy back in the 80’s. While there’s a bit of tactical combat involved, this game is mostly about reading and making choices on direction and actions. It’s also a bit short, but you’ll be playing it over and over again to experience everything to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Skud Pai Sho Online</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://skudpaisho.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Skud Pai Sho&lt;/a&gt; is a set of rules for playing Pai Sho using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://paisho.pbworks.com/w/page/24174526/Wiki%20Pai%20Sho&quot;&gt;Wiki Pai Sho&lt;/a&gt; tile set. I’ve been trying to get a game to the table for some time, having received a beautiful Pai Sho set from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lyrislaser.com/product/pai-sho-board/&quot;&gt;Lyris Laser Studio&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been tough for some reason. Now, the creator of the Skud Pai Sho variation has created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://skudpaisho.com&quot;&gt;play-by-email interface&lt;/a&gt; for playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished up a game, and was impressed with how it played. While still a work in progress, it’s fully functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to give the game a shot you can setup a game &lt;a href=&quot;http://skudpaisho.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Just make sure you read up on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://skudpaisho.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Assault Suit Leynos</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/leynos/leynoslogo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; alt=&quot;Cover&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;I can’t remember where I had gotten the game, but at some point in 1990, I first played Target Earth for the SEGA Genesis. I immediately fell in love with it. The graphics, the music, the difficulty, and the loadout based customization were an instant hit with a 9-year-old me. When I first heard about Assault Suit Leynos I thought to myself, “Wow! This looks great. It looks just like Target Earth!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because it’s a remake of Target Earth, or should I say, it’s a remake of the original Japanese title, Assault Suit Leynos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I feel a bit dumb. I’m not ashamed to admit that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/leynos/targetearth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Target Earth&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Such fond memories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those familiar with the original it plays almost exactly the same. The missions have been tweaked, some with multiple outcomes. Major additions to your arsenal are a shield, a boost, and a melee attack, all of which are extremely helpful throughout play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t familiar, Assault Suit Leynos puts you in the cockpit of a giant Assualt Suit. There’s 8 missions in the game, each with different objectives. Before each mission, you’ll choose a loadout from all your current equipment and then be sent off to do what needs to be done. Some missions involve destroying a certain target. Others, protecting one or more things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This updated version has a much faster pace to it, and a bit more of a bullet-hell feel. It also feels a bit easier than the original game, but if you’re looking for a challenge you can always play through the original from the options menu. For even more challenges, there are even ways to customize the game’s Arcade mode by unlocking modifiers throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really impressed with how Assault Suit Leynos looks. I’m even more impressed that the studio didn’t go full 3D. The 2D sprites are ultra detailed and comparatively bigger than their original counterparts. Weapon fire, explosions, and all that good stuff is in your face, sometimes blocking your view of the action. This isn’t a bad thing. It’s just what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Genesis obviously has limitations and had to reuse a lot of assets, the remake feels fresh throughout the whole game. The sheer size and breadth of the levels and enemies really takes things to a whole different level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest step in, in my opinion, is the interface. There’s not much screen space lost to things like your health, selected weapons, available weapons, boss health, etc… Everything is seamless, yet still keeps that old-school feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/leynos/bigger.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bigger and better&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Everything is a bit bigger and better&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a remake of Target Earth is a dream come true, and I’m extra glad that such care was taken in doing so. The game retains the feel of the original yet makes it modern in every way shape and form. The unlockable extras and classic mode are a great touch and the fact that they didn’t try to add any kind of multiplayer puts a smile on my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assault Suit Leynos is out on Steam and the PS4. It’s more than worth $20 even though the main campaign is a bit short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if someone would just remaster UN Squadron I’d be in geek heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Fantahzee: Hordes and Heroes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fantahzee/fantahzee.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fantahzee Box&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantahzee is a game about using Yahtzee rolls to activate heroes, kill monsters, and save the town. There’re lots of awesome combos that let you kill more monsters, earn more treasure, and hopefully beef you up enough to take down the bosses to win the game. Kill the most stuff to be declared the best hero ever. Wrap all of that up with beautiful fantasy/steampunk art and AEG has a winner on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantahzee starts you off by creating 5 horde stacks. Each of these is comprised of a boss shuffled into level 2 monsters and topped with a bunch of level 1 monsters. Then you shuffle up the treasures in a pile, the town cards in a pile, and the hero and action cards into a pile. Flip over the top card on each hoard, deal five cards to each player and start the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player’s turn is divided into several phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Action Phase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Dice Phase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Horde Phase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The End Phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each phase is pretty easy and goes by really quickly once you get into the swing of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fantahzee/bodyguard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bodyguard&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;In the Action phase a player can play 2 heroes and 2 action cards in any order. Up to five hero cards can be in a player’s party, so if you want to play another but already have five down you’ll need to discard one that’s already in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Dice Phase, a player rolls 5 dice, Yahtzee style. Basically, you get 3 rolls to try and match the dice on your hero cards to activate them. Once a hero has been activated you resolve its special ability and can add its strength to your attack in the next step. Once you’re done rolling and activating you add up the strength of all the activated heroes and go kill some monsters. You need strength equal or greater than a monster’s strength to kill it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead monsters are a good thing, but you need to be careful. If you kill a monster with a Counterattack you’ll have to hope you have enough shields or health the withstand the attack. If you don’t, some of your heroes are going to die. Also, if the monster you killed had a treasure icon on it then you can take a treasure and equip it on a hero. The number of treasure icons on the monster will dictate if you can use the level 1 or level 2 ability of the treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the Horde phase. First off, if there’s a monster in the 5th row it attacks the town. Flip the town card, resolve any special text, and place it in your victory pile for negative points at the end of the game. Then any facedown cards are flipped over and you add up the total Ambush value of the face-up cards. Apply this damage to your heroes, subtracting shields, and remove any unfortunate dead bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The End Phase is just cleanup. Draw 4 cards, discard down to your hand limit (default 5) and remove any dice from your heroes. Play continues clockwise following the described steps until 3 bosses are killed. Once that happens you add up all the victory points from your kills, subtract any village card negative points, and the player with the most VP wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the gist of it. I’ve linked to the full rules in the Supporting Links section at the bottom of this review if you’d like to get the whole picture with examples and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, AEG has put out an excellent product with Fantahzee. Production quality is high. The box feels great, the cards are durable, and the counters aren’t cheap. The artwork is colorful, beautiful, and really adds to the theme of the game. There’s even a great fabric bag to store the dice, a plastic insert to hold all the cards with spaces for future cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fantahzee/baroncloven.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bodyguard&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played Fantahzee with my 11-year-old son and 6-year-old son, and we all had a blast. The rules are simple enough that we were able to jump right into the game and learn as we went.  Card combos became more apparent the longer we played, and by the end, each of us was pulling off some pretty great turns. In the end, my 6-year-old ended up creaming us by coming almost 15 points ahead of my 11-year-old, and more than 20 points ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly honest, I hadn’t heard much about the game and probably would have just passed it by if it hadn’t turned up unannounced on my doorstep. I would have totally missed out if that were the case. Fantahzee is a great game that lets you chuck a bunch of dice and still have a bit of say on how your turn will actually go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it be for everyone? No. Fans of heavier Euro-style games with deep strategy and meaningful choices may not enjoy it. Then again you pretty much know the type of games you’re getting into when you purchase from AEG, and Fantahzee fits right in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It fits right into my game shelf as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Huge Spellweaver Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dream Reactor released a big update to Spellweaver yesterday including foil cards, new AI opponents, and a reworked tournament system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foil cards aren’t a new thing for digital CCGs, but they’re new to Spellweaver. This is a retroactive update, so all cards a player has obtained that should be foil, will be. Players are also give five extra foil cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All six of the new PvE AI opponents are Rare and will drop good rewards. There’s also four new Hard AI opponents that will test even the best players who’ve built strong decks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for tournaments, there’s now more tournament types. Prize pools have also been increased and there’s now two new bonus prizes: Completion Bonus and Top Bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the update is large it’s nothing earth shattering. It just makes an already strong game even stronger, and hopefully will help its longevity in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon Bank Updates and new Sun and Moon Pokémon.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Bank will be getting an update in January that will update the system to be compatible with Pokémon Sun and Moon. The update also will include the addition of a new National Pokédex. This new feature reads saved data from any compatible titles you connect to Pokémon Bank and collects information about all the Pokémon you have caught. You can then check out all of this information in the Pokémon Bank application and even see Pokémon that don’t natively appear in the Alola region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Poké Transporter will also be updated in January allowing players of the Virtual Console versions of Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow to transfer Pokémon caught in those games to the Pokémon Bank. From there they can be transferred to any Pokémon Bank compatible title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/pokebank.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also announced today were some new Pokémon from Sun and Moon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/evenmorenew.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Passimian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Fighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Teamwork Pokémon Passimian attack by throwing Berries at their foes. They tend to live in troops of 20–30 Passimian, who all follow one leader. These tribes work in teams to train and improve their skills. This Pokémon has the Ability Receiver, an Ability which no previous Pokémon has had. With the Receiver Ability, Passimian can inherit the Ability of an ally who faints in battle. Passimian only appear in Pokémon Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oranguru&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Normal/Psychic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sage Pokémon Oranguru live in the solitary deeps of the Alolan forests and, in fact, were once known as ‘the people of the forests’. Oranguru hold a fan-like object made of leaves and are known to be kind to other Pokémon in the forest, often giving injured Pokémon medicine or hungry Pokémon food. This Pokémon can exclusively learn the new move Instruct, a move which can make the selected target use its most recent move again immediately. Oranguru only appear in Pokémon Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previously revealed Puppy Pokémon Rockruff can evolve into a different form depending on whether you are playing Pokémon Sun or Pokémon Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lycanroc (Midday Form)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Rock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of Pokémon Sun, Rockruff is bathed in profuse amounts of solar energy, and Solgaleo’s influence causes this Pokémon to evolve into Lycanroc’s Midday Form. This form is known for speedy movement which can confound its opponents. A very loyal Pokémon, Lycanroc Midday Form dodges opponents’ strikes whilst attacking with the sharp rocks of its mane. Lycanroc Midday Form can learn Accelerock, a new move unique to the Pokémon, which is guaranteed to strike first, damaging opponents by slamming into them very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lycanroc (Midnight Form)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Rock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of Pokémon Moon, Rockruff is bathed in an abundance of lunar energy, and Lunala’s influence causes this Pokémon to evolve into Lycanroc’s Midnight Form. This Pokémon will sacrifice its own safety to strike down its foes. The stronger an opponent is, the more excited Lycanroc Midnight Form becomes, its eyes glowing with the thrill of battle. This Pokémon feels a deep trust towards a Trainer who can draw forth its true power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with new Pokémon announcements comes the announcement of two new Z-Moves for Pokémon favorites Pikachu and Eevee, as well as the new Pokémon Refresh feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pikachu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Exclusive Z-Move name: Catastropika&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pikachu’s exclusive Z-Move, Catastropika, is a super-powered attack move where Pikachu borrows its Trainer’s strength, wraps itself in extra-high-voltage electric power, and charges into its opponents. This is Pikachu’s most powerful attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eevee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Exclusive Z-Move name: Extreme Evoboost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eevee’s exclusive Z-Move, Extreme Evoboost, gathers together Sylveon, Jolteon and more – all of the eight Pokémon that Eevee can evolve into – and grants their powers to Eevee. This highly powerful move raises Eevee’s Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def and Speed by 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Refresh feature lets you care for your Pokémon. After a battle, Pokémon can sometimes end up rumpled and dirty. Pokémon Refresh lets you clean them up, care for them, feed them Poké Beans and even cure status conditions like poisoning and paralysis that were inflicted on them in battle. Pokémon that have been looked after in Pokémon Refresh can grow very affectionate and will battle to the utmost for you. This means that sometimes they may avoid attacks from opposing Pokémon or even hold out when they’re on the verge of fainting. Take good care of all your Pokémon in Pokémon Refresh, and they will be great allies on your adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecticut Festival of Indie Games Mid Year Event Wrap Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ct-fig.com/festival-info.html&quot;&gt;Connecticut Festival of Indie Games Mid-Year Event&lt;/a&gt; is now over, and it was a great time. As usual, the folks over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekfevergames.com&quot;&gt;Geek Fever Games&lt;/a&gt; put on a hell of a show. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/TabletopShopCT/info?tab=overview&quot;&gt;The Tabletop Shop&lt;/a&gt; was an excellent venue with tons of space for everyone and I’m glad I finally had a chance to take the ride over there. Huge thanks to Matt for letting everyone use the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The festival was filled to the brim pretty much the entire time I was there. I rarely saw an empty table. There were plenty of familiar faces about, and a lot of new ones, too! I had a chance to try a bunch of games I have played before, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/super-weapon&quot;&gt;Super Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samromage/no-regerts-the-game-of-art-and-poor-life-choices&quot;&gt;No Regerts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/shootagaingames2/home/looting-atlantis&quot;&gt;Looting Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, Sausage Factory, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full coverage of my time at CT FIG will be going up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; tonight. I really wanted to start yesterday, but a bit of a cold running through my family finally hit me. Rest assured I’ll have a full report of all the awesome stuff I saw completed by the end of the week!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stellar Armada - $1 Board Game</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/423304770/stellar-armada-1-board-game/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second Kickstarter pick for the month is a no-brainer as the game is only $1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/423304770/stellar-armada-1-board-game?ref=user_menu&quot;&gt;Stellar Armada&lt;/a&gt; is a game of space combat that removes the board and contains only two cards and some cardboard counters. There’s still shipping to pay, but really the game is still insanely cheap. Designer Jerason Banes even has a $5 version that includes dice and nicer tokens, or a print-and-play only version for $1 that doesn’t have a shipping cost. A total deal no matter which pledge level you go with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stellar Armanda is already fully funded and has smashed through most of its stretch goals. Jerason just send out a new update saying he’s trying to figure out what else to offer for higher stretch goals since the last one is on its way to being funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited for this one. Check out the video below for all the information you really need to know about the game, then go pledge your dollar for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eight New Safari Toys Include an Amazing Behemoth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Safari Toys has announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.safariltd.com/new-dragon-animal-dinosaur-toys/?mc_cid=086c062ed3&amp;amp;mc_eid=1308119b49&quot;&gt;eight new toys&lt;/a&gt; that are now available for purchase. One of those stood out to me immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.safariltd.com/behemoth?mc_cid=086c062ed3&amp;amp;mc_eid=1308119b49&quot;&gt;The Behemoth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This terrifying figure takes some of the classic Behemoth qualities like powerful legs and a thick tail and combines them with modern renditions like sharp teeth and spikes. The effect is striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s monstrous looking, with an amazing level of detail for a $14.99 toy. It’s 5”, which isn’t huge, but I wouldn’t expect it to be at that price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m expecting a both a Behemoth and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.safariltd.com/crystal-cavern-dragon&quot;&gt;Crystal Cavern Dragon&lt;/a&gt; in for review soon, so I’ll be able to post &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HowiSafari&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;#HowiSafari&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Looty Dungeon Hits Android on September 27th</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yodo1 is releasing &lt;a href=&quot;http://lootydungeon.com/&quot;&gt;Looty Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; to Android on September 27th. The game tosses 40 different classes, each with their own abilities, into increasingly difficult dungeons filled with monsters and traps. In a similar fashion to their wildly popular Crossy Road, Looty Dungeon features a “one-tap” control scheme. Of course it will also use a similar free-to-play model with paid unlockables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looty Dungeon is already available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/looty-dungeon/id1055455919&quot;&gt;iTunes App Store&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’ve got an iOS device you’re ready to dig in and play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - ORIGINZ: The Superpowered Card Game</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flavorfaction/originz-the-superpowered-card-game/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first September Kickstarter pick is a game I’m a huge fan on. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flavorfaction/originz-the-superpowered-card-game/comments&quot;&gt;ORIGINZ: The Superpowered Card Game&lt;/a&gt; is a self-contained card battling game with 12 different superpower decks. I’ve already done a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/09/kickstarter-preview-originz-the-superpowered-card-game/&quot;&gt;Kickstarter Preview&lt;/a&gt; for the game on Purple Pawn and have &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Originz-Tabletop-Simulator/&quot;&gt;streamed the game live&lt;/a&gt; over Tabletop Simulator with one of the game’s designers, Evan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part? The game is already funded. Pledge $40 to get your own copy, and that includes shipping. There’s also a $79 pledge level that gets your play mats for the game. Now all that needs to be done is to help Flavor Faction raise even more to include some great stretch goals, like increased card quality and Cosmic Powers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Wakanda</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wakanda/wakanda.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wakanda&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wakanda is a game about building totem poles. Being a Blue Orange game I expected it to be fun, easy to learn, and great with the kids. It was all three. The goal of the game is to claim 3 totem poles and have the highest value of poles at the end of the game. The rules clear, and the game only takes a moment to learn. Scoring is based on how your build your totem poles, and what village tiles they’re built on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to play Wakanda was a breeze. The rules are two pages long and are perfectly clear on how things are supposed to go. There’s 6 village tiles, 3 of which are unavailable to build on at first. On your turn your draw a totem piece, then take one of the following two actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place a totem piece on any available space on the board.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish a pole by capping it with one of your Headdress pieces. Once you do this you can turn activate a village tile that’s not currently available, and it can be used on future turns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game continues until all 6 poles are claimed. Points are scored by the village tiles your poles are on, and if there are any Sun icons on your pole (unless it’s on the Sun village tile.) Keep in mind that the villages you’ve built on score for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your poles, not just the one built in that village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the actual rule booklet by clicking the link in the Supporting Links at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wakanda/pieces.jpg&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;Wakanda&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;
Wakanda Blue Orange makes really nice games, and the wooden totem pieces and headdresses in Wakanda are really nice. The tiles are solid, and the pieces stand on them without any issues. The bag that holds the totem pieces is well made and doesn’t feel like it’ll break anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, I don’t expect any less from Blue Orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I haven’t played a game from Blue Orange that I didn’t like. Wakanda is very simple to learn, and provides a great challenge by making you choose when to build a pole higher, and when to claim a totem pole. There’s been plenty of times when I’ve had several good poles built up, only to have my opponent snag one on their turn. It’s a game of back and forth, trying to make sure you get the best builds for yourself on the best village tiles. It’s a bit pricey for what you get, but I really couldn’t imagine them charging any less that $20 for a game like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wakanda was provided free for review by Blue Orange Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Children Can Design Their Own Clothes With Picture This</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter is one of those super-creative types that I always wish I could be. Right now there’s nothing more in the world that she wants to do other than sew and create her own fashion designs. Today I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://picturethisclothing.com/#templates&quot;&gt;Picture This Clothing&lt;/a&gt;, a new service that allows your child to draw over a template, snap a pic, and have it turned into an actual piece of clothing. Right now they only do dresses, and matching doll dresses, but they’re planning to expand. Dresses are $49, with a matching doll dress (compatible with American Girl dolls) available as an add-on for $25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/picturethis/legodress.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lego Dress Example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only bad part is the waiting. Due to high demand there’s now an approximate 25-30 business day turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to have my daughter give this a whirl.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Castle Combat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/castlecombat/cardback.png&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Combat Card Back&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Thompson is the owner and operator of KidRealm Camps, a summer camp focused on gaming and creativity in Chantilly, VA. He’s also the designer of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.castlecombat.com&quot;&gt;Castle Combat&lt;/a&gt;, a self-published CCG for kids that takes place in the world of Sagaheim. I first saw the game at Toy Fair in 2013. I took home a sample card, and wrote Rob to see if I could get some cards to review. I’ve been playing with my kids ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Rob revamped Castle Combat in what he’s called the New Age of Sagaheim. Rules have been clarified, cards look better, and there’s new tournament Rules. The game has come a long way since I first found out about it, and Rob continues to support the product with new releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it’s core Castle Combat is very basic, it’s War. Of course it’s not that simple. Each player has their own deck which is constructed using collectible cards and follows a few rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use up to two different color cards. There are red, blue, yellow, brown, orange, purple, green, and black armies. You can also add in neutral grey cards as long as they follow the rest of the deckbuilding rules.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your deck can only be comprised of Good Guys or Bad Buys. No mixing!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decks are made up of 16 cards. Half of these can be Legendary. (Older cards that were Rare or Uncommon are now considered Legendary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Castle Combat card has a battle value, special power, and traits. The battle value is just that, how powerful the card is. Each turn you’ll play a card and roll a d6. Add the die to the battle value and if it’s higher than your opponent’s battle value your card goes into your winner pile, while your opponent’s card goes into their dungeon. Of course there’s special powers that can change the basic rules. Sometimes you may roll 2d6 and take the highest number, or lowest, and add it to your value. Some cards go to the winner pile if they have the lowest value in a battle. Some cards call for an Epic Battle where players lay all 3 cards from their hand on the table to fight. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the game you’ll draw three cards from your deck to form your hand. Each turn players place a card face down, flip them over at the same time, and resolve the battle as I’ve described above. A new card is drawn after that, and play continues. As you the game goes on you’ll build up your dungeon pile and winner pile. Once your deck runs out you shuffle your winner pile and it becomes your new draw pile. Play continues until one player’s cards are all in their dungeon and they can’t continue. The other player is then declared the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Castle Combat where all just battle value and dice rolls it’d fall pretty flat. The game really shines with all the card’s special powers, and all the combos you can create with a well built deck. Just like any CCG, there’s tons of strategies to use, and different types of decks to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had asked me about the quality of the cards before Rob released the New Age of Sagaheim set, I’d give you a very mixed reaction. Cards weren’t always cut perfectly, art was inconsistent, and sometimes very pixelated of jaggy around the edges. Text was always readable, but again, quality of it was inconsistent as well. The game was fun to play, but was very rough around the edges, sometimes literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Age of Sagaheim has fixed all that. The art on the cards is large, crips, and professional. Text is uniform, as is its placement on the cards. Everything is easy to figure out at a glance, easy to read, and more professional looking. The cut of the cards is now perfect, too. The feel great, sleeve wonderfully, and are finally a quality to be proud of. Rob has come leaps and bounds to put out a solid, quality product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/castlecombat/combatcards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Combat Cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first introduced my 6-year-old to Castle Combat back in 2013 when he was a little over 3. It was great to have a CCG I could play with him so he didn’t feel left out when his older siblings got to play Magic, Pokemon, and Yu-Gi-Oh!. The older kids then took an interest because it was something they could also play with him. Now he’s the reigning Castle Combat champ in the house, and keeper of the family’s collection of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the most complex CCG out there, but it’s a ton of fun and has a lot of charm. I always look forward to new cards, and it’s a game the kids constantly get out to play. Even my 2-year-old is starting to show interest, but is still too young to really play. You can’t get the cards anywhere except from Rob, but he’s quick to ship out orders, and his prices are fair. A booster pack of 7 cards costs $3.00, while a starter pack that contains a deluxe plastic case, two 16-card army decks, 2 rules cards, 2 battle mat cards, and 1 die is $12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend Castle Combat, especially for families with kids aged 4+. Younger kids will need a bit of help with the reading and math, but once they’re used to a deck you’ll be surprised with how much they remember of it’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon Sun and Moon Aether Foundation, Differences, More Reveals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some big news from The Pokémon Company today about the differences between Sun and Moon. Usually the different versions of a release have certain Pokémon that can only be caught in each one. Sun and Moon are also different in that the internal timer of the games are different. Sun’s time will coincide with the system clock of the 3DS, while Moon’s time will be shifted by 12 hours. Players will encounter different Pokémon on the same route depending on whether it is day or night, which means players will have different experiences according to their chosen version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dexio and Sina from Pokémon X and Pokémon Y also return in Sun and Moon, giving the player the Zygarde Cube and ask you to collect Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells. These will create a path to catching the final form of the Legendary Pokémon. Another new item in the game will be the Poké Finder, which will allow you to snap pictures of Pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokémon Sun or Moon will also feature the Aether Foundation, an organization that works in the Alola region and conducts various research projects. Residing on Aether Paradise, the artificial island that they created, their goal is to care for and provide shelter to Pokémon that have been hurt. Members of the Aether Foundation include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lusamine&lt;/strong&gt; The beautiful Lusamine is the president of the Aether Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Faba&lt;/strong&gt; Faba can be identified by his signature accessory—green sunglasses. He is the Aether Foundation’s second-in-command.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wicke&lt;/strong&gt; As the assistant branch chief of Aether Paradise, Wicke has a very caring personality and supports Faba. She is loved by all of the Aether Foundation’s employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/peeps.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aether Foundation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aether Foundation are researching Ultra Beasts, creatures that possess mighty powers and pose a threat to humans and Pokémon. One such beast is known so far: UB-01 is an Ultra Beast that has a body composed of a glass-like substance. It constantly changes shape, and its movements resemble that of a young girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of some of the new Pokémon announced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/sonew.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Null and Jangmo-o&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type: Null&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type: Null is a Synthetic Pokémon which was constructed to synthesize the strengths of various Pokémon, making it adaptable enough to complete a mission that requires a Pokémon as strong as the Pokémon of mythology. The mask fitted to this Pokémon’s head is a piece of equipment designed to control its power. Type: Null is the partner Pokémon of a newly revealed character—Gladion, the taciturn enforcer of Team Skull, who places a high value on being strong in battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jangmo-o&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scaly Pokémon Jangmo-o has the pride of a warrior and never neglects its training in its pursuit of becoming stronger. This Pokémon uses the scales on its head as a weapon both offensively and defensively. It lives in harsh locales, like canyons, where it can train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/raticate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alolan Raticate&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Raticate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type: Dark/Normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raticate in Alola live in urban areas, leading to a higher-calorie diet than that of Raticate elsewhere. This means they have tough bodies but have gotten a lot fatter. They stockpile huge amounts of food in their nests and prefer fresh fruit and high-class ingredients. Alolan Raticate is the Totem Pokémon of the trial that takes place in Verdant Cavern on Melemele Island in Pokémon Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - The Final Station</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/finalstation/hero.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hero&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A train game taking place during the end of the world? That’s just what The Final Station is. The game starts off during a beautiful morning, and by the end of your first day the world has ended and everyone is struggling to survive. Through traveling to multiple stations you’ll unravel exactly what’s going on, and hopefully save some people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s two different phases of play as you move through the world of The Final Station:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The train phase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The station phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the train phase you’ll be making sure your passengers are healthy and fed, fixing up the train, crafting new items, and listening to conversation. You’ll also get a peek at the world around you thanks to beautifully rendered backgrounds. It’s fairly simple, but can get a bit anxiety-including if you don’t have enough supplied to take care of passengers, and have to start cleaning up dead bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station phase is where you’ll be wandering towns and villages, trying to gather supplies, fighting turned humans, and learning more about what’s going on in the world. Again, it’s not terribly difficult. It’s easy to learn the patterns of the turned and save ammunition by killing them with melee attacks. Even if you do die, the game has a checkpoint system that always is just a few steps behind you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the turned, there’s a few types. None of them have names that I’ve found, but here’s what I’ve ended up calling them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normal - These just shamble slowly around and really pose no threat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Runners - These are small, and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fast. As soon as they see you then coming running at full speed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Armor - Normal turned that have swat armor. They can be killed by a melee hit to knock of their helmet, then a bullet to the head.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giants - Pretty much Normal turned, but bigger. They take the same amount of hits to take down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Burned - Normal types that are on fire. If you shoot them they’ll run toward you and explode.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humpers - Gross little Runners that stick to you and continue to do damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as protection, you get a pistol early on. Shortly after you’ll get a shotgun that’s great at taking out groups of turned at short range. Ammo is scare, but it’s melee attack is a bit stronger than your fists. I found myself using this for most of the game. Towards the end of the game you get a rifle. It’s the best weapon in the game, but comes a bit late. By that point you’ll have melee combat down with the shotgun, and only needing the pistol on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game progresses from train phase to station phase over and over again until the end. Where the game really shines is the story, which is unravelled through notes you find, people you talk to, computer terminals, other train operators, and conversations survivors have on the train. It’s really what kept me moving through the game once I had enough supplies to take care of people and enough skill to easily kill or avoid the turned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Final Station is a beautiful game with some amazing pixel art. While the characters and enemies are fairly simple, the beauty lies in the environments and amazing backdrops. There were several times where I was caught up in what was &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; my train that I neglected conversation, passenger well-being, and train maintenance. Combined with a wonderful OST, the game oozes theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/finalstation/final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Final Station Screens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun with The Final Station, but like I said earlier, I had a better time uncovering the story than through the actual gameplay. Don’t get me wrong, the gameplay was solid, but a bit repetitive. It was the visuals, music, and writing that kept me playing through the game. I had almost stopped playing the early beta I had of the game due to the lack of much of the story, and am glad I came back to play the final release. Is it worth the $14.99? Yeah, it is.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beyblade Burst on Shelves in Canada</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Bey Brad over at the World Beyblade Organization has posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbeyblade.org/Thread-Hasbro-s-Beyblade-Burst-OUT-in-Canada-First-Photos-LOTS-of-images&quot;&gt;some pics&lt;/a&gt; of Beyblade Burst on shelves in Canada. Toronto, Ontario, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be seeing them in the states soon, but it’s exciting to see English releases already. Of course there’s some difference already being spotted, like Hasbro’s Beys &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbeyblade.org/Thread-Hasbro-s-Beyblade-Burst-Energy-Layers-have-no-teeth-bursting-is-rare-UPDATED&quot;&gt;not having teeth&lt;/a&gt; on the Energy Layers. Instead there’s solid, sloped incline. This makes the parts incompatible with Takara-Tomy Burst parts. So far the Bursting effect seems uneffected, but the WBO will be conducting more tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep following up with my Hasbro PR rep in hopes to get a handful of Beys to test out, take pics of, and report on. More when I have it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokémon Sun and Moon Early Purchase Bonus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company International has announced a special in-game bonus for those who purchase Pokémon Sun or Moon before January 11th, 2017. Early purchasers will recieved a special Munchlax that will evolve into a Pulverizing Snorlax, a power Snorlax that hold &lt;em&gt;Snorlium Z&lt;/em&gt;, granting it the Pulverizing Pancake Z-Move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this announcement came the reveal of the Alolan Rattata:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/AlolanRattata.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alolan Rattata&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Rattata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Dark/Normal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike ordinary Rattata, urban areas are Alolan Rattata’s main habitat. They are nocturnal and live in nests of several dozen. Alolan Rattata have an excellent aptitude for sniffing out delicious fresh foods in Alola. They pay no attention to foods that aren’t fresh. Alolan Raticate serve as their boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to look forward to seeing all these new Alolan variations on the original 151, and hope we get more soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, I’ll post more info as it comes along. Until then you can watch the trailer for the above announcement below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

        <title>Review - Armadora</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armadora/armadora.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Armadora&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back ago Blue Orange Games sent me some of their older titles to review along with a new one they were pitching. Armadora was one of those. It’s a little game where you’re trying to get the most gold by placing influence and walls around the various hoards on the board. There’s also advanced rules where the different playable races (mage, elf, goblin, and orc) have different special actions they can take. It’s simple, quick, portable, and great with a full compliment of players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of players determines how many warriors each player gets for the game.  Power and reinforcement tokens are give to the players if the advanced rules are being used. Gold tokens are then placed into different sized piles and randomly places on the goldmines on the board, and the wooden palisades are placed off to the side to form a general pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s only 2 actions to take each turn if you’re playing the basic game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place a warrior face down on the board. Each of the warriors in a player’s pool has a number on it which determines how much influence it has.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place up to two palisades on the board. Palisades may still be played even if a player is out of warriors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play continues until each player passes their turn, then the game ends.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the game is to have the most influence over each pile of gold so you can claim it. Palisades create borders that separate influence pools, so at the end of the game you’ll have several areas to score to see who earns each pile of gold. The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advanced rules play a bit differently. On each turn a player may take &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place up to two palisades.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place a face-down warrior on the board.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place a reinforcement on top of one of their warriors that have already been placed on the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players may also activate one of their powers before performing one of the three actions mentioned above. Each faction has their own powers, as listed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8229/armador&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement tokens can only be placed on a full territory (an area surrounded by palisades that has no free spaces open), and only 1 may be played in a single territory. This bolsters that player’s total value by 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game end and scoring conditions are the same as the basic game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armadora is small and sturdy, like a dwarf. The box, board, and cardboard chits are stocky and feel great during play. The wooden palisades and gold cubes are excellent quality, and the ones in my copy had little to no defects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I like Armadora, though I have to admit I enjoyed the basic game more than the advanced rules. With how light and quick the game is, it almost felt like the advanced rules needlessly extended the game. I do wish the goldmines weren’t in fixed locations on the board, but randomly distributing the different sized gold piles helped a bit with this. It’s a good one to play with the family with its simple rules, quick setup, quick playtime, and satisfying play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end is it worth the $25? For some gamers, yes. Armadora is a good game if you know what you’re getting into. It’s nothing heavy, yet more than a filler. Better played with family than a game group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy Armadora was provided free for review by Blue Orange Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Final Station is Out Today</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing a beta build of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefinalstation.com&quot;&gt;The Final Station&lt;/a&gt; for some time now, but it’s finally been released on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/435530&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and the PS4. The game is a post-apocalyptic train game where you’re scavenging cities for supplies and survivors, trying to keep your train running, and trying to keep the survivors alive. It’s a constant juggling that provides an excellent challenge, all with a moody, pixel style and eerie soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have a full review up soon, but I highly recommend paying the $15 to snag this one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Assault Suit Leynos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of press releases, and more often than not I skip a lot of the video game related ones. Every once and a while something catches my eye. This time it’s Assault Suit Leynos, a side-scrolling-bullet-hell-mech game from Rising Star Games. Available now for &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=35733063&amp;amp;msgid=527186&amp;amp;act=8QBT&amp;amp;c=275324&amp;amp;destination=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F441350%2F&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and PS4 at $19.99 for the standard edition, with a digital-only special edition costing $24.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really caught my eye about this one was how much it reminded me of the 1990 Sega Genesis classic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Earth_(video_game)&quot;&gt;Target Earth&lt;/a&gt;, a favorite of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a review key for the game, and will stream/review it soon. It looks pretty great, and I’m hoping it really is a modern take on a classic favorite of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - The Lords of Rock</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bravefrontierstudios/the-lords-of-rock/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After ruling the universe for millennia, the gods have found their power diminishing and some have faded away completely. Those remaining are forced into a battle for their very survival: War would only lead to annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They have agreed that their battle for souls and power must be played out on the cosmic stage…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… and that stage only allows Rock and Roll.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t really sum up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bravefrontierstudios/the-lords-of-rock&quot;&gt;The Lords of Rock&lt;/a&gt; better than that, which is ripped straight from SolarFlare’s Kickstarter page for the game. The game has you pick four gods from a pantheon and battle it out in epic venues for the souls of mankind. The gods of Egyptian, Aztec, Greek, and Norse pantheons are part of the base game with Eldar Gods and the Chinese pantheon added in from the stretch goals. Venues like Atlantis, Alexandria, and more set the stage for the mighty Battle of the Bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art here looks amazing, and the whole premise of The Lords of Rock is just too awesome for words. The game is already funded, and has a little over two days left to go. The best part is that it’s just $20 shipped for the base game and all the unlocked stretch goals. That’s a lot of value. You can back a bit more to get custom guitar picks, poker cards, and t-shirts (because all good bands have t-shirts!) There’s even a great game mat available at higher tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 27</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most unusual circumstance or location in which you’ve game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already mentioned this back on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/RPGaDay-Day10/&quot;&gt;Day 10&lt;/a&gt;. There were times during summer camp where we’d play AD&amp;amp;D 2nd while in the camp van. It’s not super unusual, but it’s what I’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really wasn’t too hard. The Planescape setting at the time came in a box, so that’s where the dice were rolled. Clipboards were always readily available, so character sheets weren’t a problem either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really the only thing that was a problem was car sickness.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Pixel Glory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pixelglory/pixelglory.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pixel Glory&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zaftygames.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Zafty Games&lt;/a&gt; had a small booth setup at PAX East 2016 with tons of copies of Pixel Glory stacked all over their table. The minimalist black box and game’s 8-bit art immediately drew me to the game, and I was lucky enough to get a copy for review not too long after the show. It’s a super simple game that plays in two phases: a deckbuiling phase and a dungeon phase. It’s quick, easy to play, and overall light fare. The art is mostly 8-bit, with a bit of 16-bit mixed in when it comes to the monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I just stated, the game is played in two phases. The first is an auction phase where players are taking turns picking up face up spell cards to build their deck. Each player has auction cards labeled 1-9, and will play one each turn to determine the order in which players can choose cards from the table. Once an auction card is used, it’s discarded. When players take a spell card, they also get to take any number of basic elemental attack cards listed on that spell. All cards obtained are placed in a pile for the next phase. As players go through the rounds collecting spells, monsters are flipped over from the pre-constructed monster deck, giving the players an idea of what they’re up against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the players have exhausted their auction cards, the dungeon phase begins. The monster deck is shuffled with the Dungeon Keeper added in, and then the Dungeon Lord is placed at the bottom of that deck. Players remove all the unused cards from the auction phase and shuffle the cards they took into their deck. Three monsters are flipped over, each player draws four cards from their deck, and the game continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn a player must play all their cards, with the exception that one card can be kept in reserve. Monsters are attacked with basic attack cards and spells, with bonuses being applied for spell’s and attack’s elements. The goal here is to kill the monsters. Only the player who deals the killing blow to a monster gets the points at the end of the game. You need to juggle doing damage to monsters, but not so much that another player can steal the kill after your turn. Combo counters can be earned by meeting certain criteria on monster cards, or not killing a monster on your turn. Exchange three of these to draw four cards or kill any elemental monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cool rule here is that anytime you kill a monster you have the option to reshuffle your deck. This let’s you get powerful cards you’ve already played back into rotation. Also, having one card in reserve may give you the boost you need to pick off a monster before someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game ends when the Dungeon Lord is defeated. The player with the most points from their killed monster wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Glory is pretty much just cards with a few wooden cubes and hearts. The cards are flexible and sturdy, but nothing overly special. The wooden hearts are cool, and the cubes are your average wooden cube. A few of my cubes had chips/defects in them, but nothing that really inhibited gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids and I had a good time with this game, but I can’t say it’s something that’ll hit the table very often. While simple and fun to play, it didn’t really stand out as something we couldn’t get somewhere else. It’s by no means a bad game, just not a memorable one for us. The deckbuiling phase is very light, and the dungeon phase’s main challenge was not weakening monsters so much that other players could kill them. A few cool mechanics here and there are what pull this game into the “good” category, but aren’t really enough to make it shine. Monsters don’t do anything except take punishment, and there’s very little player interaction in the cards. At $30 I’d pass by this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy Pixel Glory was provided free for review by Zafty Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 25</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes a good character?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player makes a good character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not just talking about assigning stats, creating the backstory, etc… It’s all about how the player actually &lt;em&gt;plays&lt;/em&gt; their character. Even the most tired tropes and cliches can be great when in the hands of a good player. What makes a good player is hard to describe, but you always know when you’ve got one. A good player/character helps the game flow, making the story a more of a living entity as time goes on. They roll with the GM, helping to shape the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What game are you likely to give to others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different strokes for different folks. I can’t say there’s one game I’d give universally. D&amp;amp;D is a solid choice for many fantasy fans, but even then it may not be the best choice. I’d love to give Dungeon World for its simplicity. Apocalypse World for those who may not be into fantasy, but still would like the simpler system. Shadowrun is great and oozes an amazing theme. G.U.R.P.S is a gateway drug for many, with it’s staggering amount of content past the core rulebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to what I actually &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; given to people, there’s only 1 (two if you count editions.) I’ve only ever given the HDL System and Paragon: HDL 2nd Edition from &lt;a href=&quot;http://tremorworks.com&quot;&gt;Tremorworks&lt;/a&gt;, I publishing company I cofounded back in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/goawaymonster/goawaynew.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Go Away Monster, 2016 Edition&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gamewright.com&quot;&gt;Gamewright&lt;/a&gt; has released a new edition of their classic kid’s game, Go Away Monster. Originally printed in 1997, and again in 2003, 2005, and 2008, the game had previously looked pretty much the same up until this new release. The 2016 edition features a new box footprint, and brand new art to bring a bit more of a modern look to the game. Gameplay remains the same, and it’s still a game I’d recommend to any family looking to introduce games to kids age 2+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplay in Go Away Monster is very simple. Each player has a board that represents a bedroom. On this board there’s a few empty spaces: a bed, lamp, picture, and stuffed animal. Each turn players reach into a cloth sack to try and pull out one of these items for their board. If they find a piece they need, it goes on their board. If it’s a piece they already have, they can offer it to another player. There’s also a chance it could be a be a monster! If it is, the player yells “Go away monster!” and throws the piece into the box. The game ends when all players fill their boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very simple game that helps kids learn how to take turns and share. It also helps kids master a fear of monsters by putting them in control, tossing them into the box when they pop up. Of course kids can really do what they like with the critters. My two-year-old someones feels bad for the rejected monsters, sometimes offering them a space on the bed piece so they don’t feel sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/goawaymonster/goawayold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Go Away Monster, 2008 Edition&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;Go Away Monster is really about the art and pieces. Each piece is made from sturdy cardboard and has a unique shape. Through multiple plays children can learn what to feel for in the bag, knowing if they’ve got a lamp or a monster in their grasp. The art in this new edition is crisp, colorful, and friendly. The older editions had a more hand-drawn look, like an old storybook. The new edition has art that wouldn’t look out of place in modern children’s cartoons. It’s no better, or worse, than the previous editions. Just different. My 6-year-old, who grew up with the 2008 edition, seems to like the art on the new edition better, though he did say he really liked the look of the older monsters. They seemed more like something out of Sesame Street than Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game is must-have for families with really young children. My 2-year-old loves the game, and his older siblings (and my wife and I) love playing with him. He gets excited when pulling a piece that he needs, and loves to share pieces that he already has on his board. His reactions to the monsters are different each time we play. Sometimes the monsters get tossed into the box, but like I said earlier, sometimes he makes space on his board for them. He really seems to like the oval, orange monster, calling it the “Owl Monster.” It’s not a game that older kids will really take out and play on their own, but it’s not intended for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new edition of Go Away Monster is $14.99, and I’m glad it’s back in print. It was getting hard to find for a while, and my wife and I love to give this as a gift for new parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of the new edition of Go Away Monster was provided free for review by Gamewright Games. I had previously purchased the 2008 edition in 2008.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 23</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share one of you ‘Worst Luck’ Stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story is, once again, from an AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition game in my college days. I had recently rolled up a new character due to the untimely death of the last. I don’t even remember which character died, because he was a brief character rolled up after the untimely death of the character before him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a bunch of character deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new character was pretty great. He was a Human Psionic, and so far was having a great streak of luck. Basically he was surviving. Rolls were great, feats of great psionic powers were being done. I got a bit cocky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the underground lair of the amethyst dragon. I forgot why the party was there, or what the poor creature did to deserve our wrath, but we managed to get it into an open cavern and forced it to fly. Amethyst dragons aren’t the best fliers, so we figured we had the advantage. Through some amazing rolling I managed to jump on it’s back, ride it for a fair bit of time, and get setup for a great psionic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DM calls for a throw. Pfff. No problem. I’d been rolling great that night!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rolled a 1. I can’t even call it a natural 1, because it was one of those wild rolls that falls of the table, gets lost, then found, and the DM says to call it as it lay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That damn dragon dove for a tunnel and painted the ceiling of it with my innards.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Force Grey: Giant Hunters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I never thought I’d enjoy watching people play RPGs. I couldn’t quite get into &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekandsundry.com/shows/critical-role/&quot;&gt;Critical Role&lt;/a&gt;, though I love Matthew Mercer and crew. It’s just too long. Too raw. Then came Wil Wheaton’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekandsundry.com/shows/titansgrave/&quot;&gt;Titansgrave&lt;/a&gt;. It was edited into one hour chunks, had some cool art to go with it, and was a joy to watch. I also really enjoyed the one-off &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekandsundry.com/vin-diesel-nerdist-and-geek-and-sundrys-critical-roll-battle-in-ddiesel/&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;Diesel&lt;/a&gt; video that Geek &amp;amp; Sundry and The Nerdist put together with Vin Diesel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve discovered the Nerdist is putting out &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/force-grey-giant-hunters&quot;&gt;Force Grey: Giant Hunters&lt;/a&gt;, an edited D&amp;amp;D show with Matthew Mercer as the DM and a bunch of geek celebrities as the players. Episodes are around 30 minutes long, and follow the adventures of Whil Wee-Tawn (Chris Hardwick), Dagny Halvor (Ashley Johnson), Brawlwin Chainminer (Shelby Fero), Joppa (Jonah Ray), Hitch (Utkarsh Ambudkar), and eventually Calliope (Brian Posehn). It’s a bit more combat focused than Titansgrave was, but that’s not a bad thing. It’s also much shorter. 7 30-minute episodes as opposed to 10 1-hour episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show was put together with the help of Legendary Digital to promote the new Forgotten Realms Storm King’s Thunder adventure releasing in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been enjoying the hell out of this one, and am really hoping for more. Matt is a great DM, and the players are hilarious and a blast to watch as they stumble over each other and overcome the obstacles thrown at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checkout Episode 1 below, then watch the rest on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl4T6p7km9daNfMrrEpm9mFzuP-TSmDMe&quot;&gt;The Nerdist’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supposedly random game events that keep reoccurring?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever experienced this. GM’s that I’ve known, myself included, have certain events that we reuse in games, but it’s entirely intentional. It seems most people I’ve played with have their own ideas and signature bits and pieces that they always seem to include in a game as part of their style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example. I really like “approachable” villains. Characters who regularly interact with the plays, usually in non-violent ways. These are the types of villains who are so confident in themselves, that a chat with the heroes is just like sitting down and visiting with an old friend. They heroes and villain are familiar with each other, almost intimately. There’s a human connection that I find really enjoyable in stories. Do all the players I’ve GM’d for dig this? Not always.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funniest misinterpretation of a rule in your group?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortest. Post. Ever. I can’t think of a single time a group I’ve played in has misinterpreted a rule where it was humorous.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rpgaday/add2nd.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most challenging but rewarding system have you played?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AD&amp;amp;D 2nd. Not only was it difficult because it was my first RPG, but as far as all the systems I’ve played to date, it’s still the most complicated. Charts, THAC0, dice, etc…!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it’s one of my favorite systems, so I guess you can say it’s been rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most systems I’ve played since AD&amp;amp;D 2nd seem to focus on streamlining rules and having them be less invasive, though Traveller 5 seemed overly complicated. Probably the most complicated I’ve played to date. It wasn’t very rewarding, though. It was a hot mess.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 19</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Way to Learn a New Game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no better way than to play. It’s even better if you can play with someone who’s familiar with the system. Mistakes will surely be made, but you’ll get into the game and the important mechanics quickly enough, and soon you’ll be off with a familiarity that just can’t be gotten from reading the books alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying you &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; read the materials. A quick look through is always a good idea, but it can’t beat just sitting down and plunging in head first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell. I don’t think I’d have ever starting playing RPGs if I didn’t just sit down and play. I’d probably have the books on my shelf, sitting there collecting dust until I decided to flip through again and sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 18</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What innovation could RPG groups most benefit from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well here’s an interesting topic. Two main technologies come to mind: VR, and Holographic Projection. How better become immersed in the fictional worlds we play in? Of course both would take a lot of time and money invested to properly work, and in my opinion would take away from one of the main reasons to play RPGs. That reason? To unplug with some friends and enjoy some low-tech fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something charming about pencil and paper RPGs. Physically rolling dice, flipping pages to look up rules/charts, constantly updating a character sheet with various items, stats, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what would be great? Something like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://noteslate.com&quot;&gt;Noteslate&lt;/a&gt; preloaded with character sheets, maps, and books.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Baba Yaga</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/babayaga/baba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Baba Yaga&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamewright.com&quot;&gt;Gamewright&lt;/a&gt; games, and their latest, Baba Yaga, doesn’t disappoint. It’s a great card game where you’re trying to get your hand value down to 4 or less. One you do you can call “Baba Yaga” to end the game and have everyone tally up their hands. The lowest value overall wins. It plays 2-5 players ages 8+ in 15 minutes. I’d say that 8+ is really 6+, as my 6-year-old had no problem learning and playing the game independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baba Yaga consists of 3 draw decks, and two discard piles. The main deck is where players will be drawing from, while the two other decks contain Baba Yaga cards and Owl cards. the main deck contains potion cards valued from 1-7, wild cards, pelican cards, cat cards, garlic cards, and lost wand cards. Baba Yaga cards are all the same, and are worth 0 point. Owl cards can be used to purchase two Baba Yaga cards for a cost of 7. To start the game two cards are flipped from the main deck to form the two discard piles, and each player gets a hand of five cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn players can take one of three different actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Exchange a card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First discard a card into one of the two discard piles. A card can then be drawn from the main deck or the top of the other discard pile. The only exception is if the top card was a spell played the by the previous player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Cast a spell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discard potion cards that equal the cost of the spell you wish to cast, then discard the spell card on top of them and resolve it. Once you’re done, draw back up to 5 cards. Spells are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pelicans:&lt;/em&gt; Draw a Baba Yaga or Owl card.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Owls:&lt;/em&gt; Draw two Baba Yaga Cards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cats:&lt;/em&gt; Steal a Baba Yaga or Own from another player.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lost Wands:&lt;/em&gt; Each player (except the caster) must discard one Baba Yaga or Owl card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Call “Baba Yaga.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the total value of cards in a player’s hand is 4 or less they can call “Baba Yaga” to end the game. All players lay their hands face up and total all cards. The player with the lowest total wins. “Baba Yaga” is an action in its own right. A player cannot call it any time they have a value of 4 or less in their hand, only as their turn action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few notes. Wild cards can be played as any number, and are worth 10 points if in a player’s hand at the end of the game. Garlic can be discarded to protect a player from a Cat or Lost Wand. It is also worth 10 points at the end of the game. Players must always draw up to 5 cards after playing cards. This includes when cards are stolen, when discards are forced, and when garlic is played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much to Baba Yaga, being a card game. The box is a bit larger than the deck, but not overly so. It fits the cards and the rules perfectly with not much wasted space. The card stock feels durable, shuffles easily, and the artwork on the cards is quirky and kid friendly (if not a little weird).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids and I really enjoyed this game. It was very simple to learn, yet provided interesting choices throughout play. Choices of when to take a Baba Yaga card or Owl were numerous. Having multiple Baba Yaga cards is great for lowering your hand value, but gives you less space for potion cards to cast spells. Then there’s the anxiety of having a hand value of 4 or less and hoping it stays that way, or that no one else calls “Baba Yaga,” until it’s your turn again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At $11.99, Baba Yaga is a great deal. This is a must-have card game for families, and one that I can see taking on trips with us for a while in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 17</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What fictional character would be the best fit in your group?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer I go on with this RPGaDay challenge, the more I regret participating. I’m half tempted to stop and delete all the current posts I’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t though. I’ll push on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What fictional character would be the best fit? I have no idea. If I were to ask my kids they’d probably want someone from Pokemon, since they’re all currently obsessed. My older game group? Who knows. We all have varying tastes in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me? I’m currently in the middle of a few different books, so it would probably be someone from one of those. Maybe Kvothe from the Kingkiller Chronicles, or Ged from Earthsea. Possibly Bishop from the Generations Trilogy. Knack from The 33 to be sure. He’d be helpful to have around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are fictional characters I’d like to &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; with, though. They’re not necessarily ones that would be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh. I continue on with these crazy prompts…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Mint Works</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/five24labs/mint-works-the-pocket-sized-worker-placement-game/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next pick for the month of August is Mint Works, by Five24 Labs. It’s a pocket-sized, light worker placement game for 2-4 players, and fits in a mint tin. Mint Works supposedly plays in 20 minutes, yet provides a level of depth beyond it’s size and easy of play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/mintworksrules&quot;&gt;Download the rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief overview of the game from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/five24labs/mint-works-the-pocket-sized-worker-placement-game?ref=user_menu&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;• During the game each player will have a limited number of Mint Tokens, which represent their workers.&lt;br /&gt;
• Players will use these mint tokens to earn more tokens, take first player or buy and build plans.&lt;br /&gt;
• Plans are how players earn points. Some plans will only give points, others will give extra powers to the owner.&lt;br /&gt;
• Once a player has at least 7 points, play continues until the end of the the round, at which point the game ends.&lt;br /&gt;
• Whoever has the most points provided by plans they have built wins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game looks pretty sweet, with a minimal design and pleasing color-palette. A $10 pledge gets you the game, which is also a bonus. Since the game is funded already you’re guaranteed that copy, too, as well as all the stretch goals that have already been unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Formula μ</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/formulamicro/micro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Formula Micro&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/formula-micro&quot;&gt;Formula μ&lt;/a&gt; (Formula Micro) from Michael Groll’s Games when I had requested a review copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/11/second-lookoperation-dandelion/&quot;&gt;Operation Dandelion&lt;/a&gt;. Originally I wasn’t planning on writing a review of the game, but I figured I might as well give it a shot since it was sitting on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formula μ manages to pack an exciting racing game in a small package. The games has rules for a simpler, family version and a more strategic full-fledged version. You can check them out &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.thegamecrafter.com/1471479795/Rulebook%20printer%20friendly.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The game has what you’d expect from a racing game. Customizable cars, shifting gears, speed management, fuel, damage, pitstops, etc… It also features modular race tracks assembled with cards. It teaches quick, plays quick, and has a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; small footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids and I have played both the full and family rules. Both maintain the excitement of the race, though I prefer going whole hog and managing everything. The family version works well, but really is just meant to play with younger ones so they can get the feel of the game. My 6-year-old was a bit overwhelmed going past the family game, but held his own even though he got a bit frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s not the most beautiful game out there. It’s fairly plain, and the component quality isn’t outstanding. The cars are represented by wooden cubes, and the tracks are very minimal, using colors to indicate the speed limit of the spaces. The cards for each player are the most detailed component in the game, but are still more functional than anything else. The game is as visually barebones as needed to get the point across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit pricy, but that’s to be expected seeing as it’s made on demand through The Game Crafter. Even at $24.99 it’s worth taking a look. There’s a lot of choices during play, and a strategic depth that I wouldn’t have guessed at first glance. Formula μ feels like a big-box racing game, just with the visuals and size stripped down to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really glad I took a chance to try this one. Fans of racing games should definitely give this one a go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Tally Ho!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tallyho/product.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tally Ho!&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always enjoyed the Kosmos 2-player line. Classics like Odin’s Ravens, Hera and Zeus, Lost Cities, Blue Moon, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really excited when Thames and Kosmos wanted to send me a few of their latest 2-player games for 2016. One of these is a new edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thamesandkosmos.com/index.php/product/category/games/tally-ho&quot;&gt;Tally Ho!&lt;/a&gt;, a game about hunters and wildlife. It’s a two player game where one person takes control of the animals, and one the hunters. Each player takes turns flipping over tiles, and moving tiles of their own to try and remove the other player’s tiles from the board. There’s also pheasants and ducks that both players can capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is really simple to learn, but it fell kind of flat for me. So much is dependent on the luck of the tile flip, and the orientation of the tile. Hunters, for instance, can only fire in the direction their gun is pointed.  It’s not that easy to maneuver one to take a shot if tile flips aren’t in your favor. There’s also a time constraint. Once all the tiles are flipped there’s only a few turns left to try and wrap things up. Animals are trying to escape while the hunters are still trying to take them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve played a few times where things worked out and the game felt exciting. Unfortunately I’ve played more times were tile flips were just frustrating. My kids, on the other hand, really enjoy the game and have played it almost every day over summer vacation so far. Maybe it’s just not for me. You can download the full rules &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thamesandkosmos.com/manuals/full/691837_tallyho_manual.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to get a better feel for the game overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is something you’re interested in, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thamesandkosmos.com/index.php/product/category/games/tally-ho&quot;&gt;snag it&lt;/a&gt; from Thames and Kosmos for $19.95.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 16</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical person you’d like in your group? What Game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gygax. It’s gotta be Gygax. He’s the daddy of modern RPGs, and I’d love to play Chainmail with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I’d want to play in the back at the beginning when everything was fresh and new. I feel like if I were to play now it wouldn’t feel as magical. I would have loved to have been there things began. To play when things started to take off. To play those sessions where things didn’t work out quite as planned, or when they worked out so well that it was a no-brainer that they’d be part of the released system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To play Chainmail, and it’s eventual variation to D&amp;amp;D, with the man himself would be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hand of Fate 2 - New Companion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2014/08/second-lookhand-of-fate/&quot;&gt;Hate of Fate&lt;/a&gt;, though I got burnt out on it fairly quickly. It felt like a great start, but it needed a bit more. Hand of Fate 2 looks like it may deliver that, though I’ll have to see once it’s actually released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Defiant Development announced a new companion to help players. Colbjorn is a brutal melee warrior who also provides an extra die to roll during mini-games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While he’s been announced, his full debut will be at PAX West 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hand of Fate 2 will be released in Q1 of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 15</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your best source of inspiration of RPGs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s kind of a lame answer, but I’m sure it’s one most people would choose. Everything is inspiration. A hike through the woods. The sights/sounds while driving to work every day. Every movie I’ve ever watched. Every book I’ve ever read. The awesome art I saw online, or even some other great game I’ve recently played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If course if I had to choose just one I’d say books, both fiction and non-fiction. I read a lot, and am always pulled away into one fantastical world or another. Bits of this fantasy mixed with pieces of this sci-fi in a world very similar to this historical place. Every book is a world in and of its own, sometimes even a galaxy or an entire universe. How could you not be filled with innumerable ideas while visiting Middle Earth, Earthsea, Hogworts, Crescent Station, the depths of the 7th-Son facility, or the steampunk cities of The Gearheart.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - 4 the Birds</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/4thebirds/4thebirds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4 the Birds&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to say, right off the bat, that I was skeptical about &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakinggames.com/products/4-the-birds&quot;&gt;4 the Birds&lt;/a&gt; when it first arrived on my doorstep. Just from reading the flavor text on the back of the box I though it may be a bit boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That isn’t to say the game doesn’t have any issues, but the ones it does have are easily remedied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main complaints about the game were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1)&lt;/em&gt; The rulebook isn’t very clear on a few issues. Mainly what to do with you roll a Hawk and a Crow. There were a few other bits the rules aren’t clear on, but this was a big one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2)&lt;/em&gt; There’s little asterix tokens that come with the game that aren’t mentioned &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; in the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3)&lt;/em&gt; A card reference printed on the board references the cat piece. This doesn’t exist. The actual card has you move a Hawk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK. There’s my 3 biggies. Out of those three, two of those issues are fixed with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135056/4-birds-rules-v2-booklet&quot;&gt;v2 ruleset&lt;/a&gt; available on BoardGameGeek. This rulebook is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better than the one provided with the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last issue about the cat? Just ignore it. The card has the proper text, and it really has no effect on gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How’s the game overall? Really fun! The Crows, Hawks, action cards, and Pecking Order rules make it so much more strategic than your run-of-the-mill four-in-a-row games. The game takes a few minutes to really get going, but once the board starts to fill a bit you really need to make some decisions. There’s some cases where a well-placed Hawk will displace one of your birds in a direction you want them to move. Placing a crow in the right spot may force someone’s hand, making them play a card to get that crow out of their way and possibly making room for you to sweep in for the win. Well rolled doubles may land you a great action card back in your hand that’ll give you the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the components, they’re colorful and well made. Each bird is put together from two thick pieces of cardboard, and stands really well on the board. The board is more functional than anything else, but fits well among the multitude of colors and birds on it at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games rarely take more than 30 minutes. There’s virtually zero setup except sorting out birds to the players and placing a few Crows/Hawks on the board at the start. For a game I went into with zero expectations I was really surprised my how much fun we ended up having. The kids are upstairs now, supposedly sleeping, but actually talking about our last play and what they could have done differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, that’s the sign of a good game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth the $40? You bet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your dream team of people you used to game with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned some of these people already in previous posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dennis D.&lt;/strong&gt; - The person who first got me into RPGS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scott&lt;/strong&gt; - A great RPG player and GM that I spent many summers RP’ing with at camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe&lt;/strong&gt; - One of the best GM’s I’ve ever played with from high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian and Greg&lt;/strong&gt; - Two great people from my college RPG times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wouldn’t want the group to be much bigger than that. Also, I have no idea if this group would actually work well together. While they all had their strong points, and contributed to my history of playing RPGs, I have no idea if the group would really mesh well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Three Cheers for Master</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/threecheers/3cheers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Cheers for Master box&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlas Games had a mountain of &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlas-games.com/product_tables/AG1360.php&quot;&gt;Three Cheers for Master&lt;/a&gt; boxes at their PAX East booth this year. It was pretty hard not to notice as you walked by. Everytime I walked by the booth there were demos of the game being run with people crowded around the table. I never really got near the table, but I was able to bring a copy home to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master is sad. As one of his foreminions, you’ve decided to cheer him up with a cheerleading competition. You, and the other players, must make towers of minions to please the Master when he returns. It’s a shame that they’re not the brightest. They’re also mean, nasty, hungry, and out for blood. As you try to stack them they’ll be prone to break out in Big Hairy Fights, killing many of each other and toppling the towers you are trying so hard to build. Thankfully you can jump into the fray to try and keep things under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full rules? They’re at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is it fun? It took me and the kids a bit to get the hang of things, but once we did we had a blast. We made a few mistakes here and there during Big Hairy Fights, but the more we played the more fun we had. The minions are pretty hilarious, and it’s great to watch towers topple as they kill each other. The strategy of trying to build stable towers while placing nastier minions on other players’ towers, combined with mitigating damage they’re trying to do to you keeps you on your toes the entire game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that it’s easy to forget to move your foreminion around, but it’s a super important piece to have in play. Not only will it tame the aggression of the minion it’s on, but it’ll also save that minion from being attacked. That, and it provides a score multiplier at the end of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really enjoyed this one from soup to nuts. It takes a bit to fully understand the rules, especially how to resolve fights, but once you get it down you’ll have a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to snag a set for yourself? You should. Head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.warehouse23.com/products/three-cheers-for-master&quot;&gt;Warehouse 23&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just $19.95.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes a successful campaign?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these prompts feel like they’re really dialing it in…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a successful campaign? Both the players, and the GM, having fun. That’s pretty much the entirety of it. If you’re not having fun, then the campaign isn’t successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean a campaign can’t invoke anger, sadness, regret, or any other emotion. A good, fun campaign will play off your emotions. Make you feel love, or hate. Joy, and terrible sadness. Longing, loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end we play to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What game is your group most likely to play next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got two groups I’m lining up to play with. The first is my kids. We’ve been prepping and trying to find time to start a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nothankyouevil.com/&quot;&gt;No Thank You, Evil!&lt;/a&gt; campaign. It’s an awesome system for kids that encourages helping each other out, and lets kids really run wild with their imagination. The first campaign we’ll play is the included one, Lost in Dragonsnot Falls. They’re really excited, and I keep meaning to get the game started, but I’ve been buried with review games lately. Hopefully we’ll get this running before the summer is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the other group, I feel like it’ll most likely be D&amp;amp;D 5th, though I’d love to get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dungeon-world.com/&quot;&gt;Dungeon World&lt;/a&gt; to the table. I fell in love with the game as I read through the book for the first time, and have been drooling to play. I’ve heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://apocalypse-world.com/&quot;&gt;Apocalypse World&lt;/a&gt; is actually a bit better, so I look forward to grabbing the new edition once it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hasbro's Beyblade Burst App Briefly Hits iTunes Store</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday some Beyblade fans were lucky enough to grab Hasbro’s upcoming Beyblade Burst app as it popped up on the iTunes store, then was quickly taken down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit user &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com/user/n0xWave&quot;&gt;n0xWave&lt;/a&gt; was able to grab some screens for me, since he was able to get the app before it disappeared. In the shots you can get a good look at the interface, and some of the app’s functionality. We also get a glimpse of what Hasbro is renaming some of the Beys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/beybladeburst/bbb11.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beyblade Burst Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see it’s similar to past Beyblade apps released by Hasbro, but with some extra functionality like a scanner, most likely for scanning codes that come with physical Beys. In the past they used codes you had to enter by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it’s looking pretty slick, and it’s nice to know we’ll get seeing Burst in the states soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 11</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which gamer most effected the way you play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t really say one player has effected the way I play more than others, as my experience as a role-player only grows with each different person I play with. Was is Dennis D., the first person to introduce me to RPGs back when I was 8-years-old? Was it Scott, who first introduced me to different campaign settings? How about Gabe, the most excellent GM I played with in high school? Greg, who both ran and played so many different campaigns in college? What about Wil Wheaton? I’ve read and watched his thoughts/experiences with RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so many people who’ve opened my eyes to may different ways and styles of play. I can’t just choose one and say they’ve had the greatest impact on me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokemon Sun and Moon Team Skull and More</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company International announced Pokémon Sun and Moon info today, including: new Pokémon and the new antagonists, Team Skull!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new creatures announced today include: Wishiwashi, Pyukumuku, Morelull, and Alolan classics Alolan Meowth, Alolan Marowak, and Alolan Raichu (who surfs on his tail!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/morenew2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More new pokemon&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wishiwashi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wishiwashi have a new Ability, Schooling, which no Pokémon has previously had. Under certain conditions, Wishiwashi will change in battle to their School Form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solo Form&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single Wishiwashi is tiny and weak. Measuring just eight inches from nose to tail, Wishiwashi is very small, even for a Pokémon. Yet the people of the Alola region seem to view it as a terrifying Pokémon. When it’s in danger, Wishiwashi’s glistening eyes catch the light and shine out, sending a distress signal to its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;School Form&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seemingly weak Wishiwashi is called the demon of the sea because of its ferocious School Form. When Wishiwashi receive a distress signal, they unite in a huge battle formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pyukumuku&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to their appearance and way of life, Pyukumuku are considered unappealing to tourists. Part-time work pulling Pyukumuku off the beach and chucking them back into the sea is available at tourist beaches. But no matter how far they’re thrown, Pyukumuku will always return to the same spot. Pyukumuku have a new Ability, Innards Out, which no other Pokémon has had before. When this Pokémon faints, Innards Out lets it dish out a final bit of damage to its opponent, equal to the amount of HP it had left before it received the final blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morelull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Grass/Fairy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morelull are nocturnal Pokémon that walk around at night on their leg-like roots. They move because staying in one spot and sucking all the nutrients from the soil would cause surrounding plants to wither. With their roots, they make contact with other Morelull and communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/alolaold2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alola Classics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Meowth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Dark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meowth is a Pokémon that did not originally live in the Alola region. They were sent to the royal family of Alola as an offering from another region, and only a select few could have them as partners. It’s said that the Meowth that were offered to the royalty lived a life of luxury and pampering, which led them to have a selfish and prideful attitude. This caused Meowth’s form to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Marowak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Fire/Ghost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marowak in the Alola region take bones and light both ends on fire by rubbing them against their foreheads. Then they spin the bones around! Marowak’s rarity and its fearsome appearance when it dances with its bone led the people of Alola to dub it a conjurer and regard it with fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Raichu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Electric/Psychic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Raichu in Alola have two types—Electric and Psychic—and they are able to wield psychic power. What’s more, they can gather their psychic power in their tails and then ride on them to float in the air!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Skull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/teamskull.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Team Skull&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Alola region, a group of ruffians known as Team Skull are new baddies in Sun and Moon. Typical stuff. Stealing Pokémon, messing up trials, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Skull Boss: Guzma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guzma is the boss of Team Skull, the one who holds these ruffians together. Guzma pours on the attacks, battling without mercy. He certainly does seem strong, but he claims that he “never could become captain.” He seems to have a bone to pick with Professor Kukui, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Skull Admin: Plumeria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plumeria is considered the big sister of Team Skull. She’s a tough lady who keeps the members of Team Skull in line and working together, in the sort of way a strict older sister would. She seems to care for the Grunts who are below her in the pecking order, and she’s not one to let it go if anyone gives them a walloping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Skull Grunts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both male and female Team Skull Grunts wear matching black Skull Tanks. And these uniforms aren’t even provided for them—all Grunts have to buy their own!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 10</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Largest in-game surprise you have experienced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprises are always fun, even when they’re not. They a bit of excitement and can dramatically change the tone of a game session. One of the largest, and well pulled off, surprises I’ve experienced in a game was during an set of extended Planescape sessions. The session in question was played over the course of a summer, mostly at camp. I was probably 13-14 years old, and it was my first introduction to the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren’t many of us. There was the DM, and 2-3 players including myself. It wasn’t a very serious campaign, or ultra structured. We played here an there, with longer sessions taking place on rainy days where we could sequester a place indoors and could spread out a bit. The game mostly had us in Sigil, the city of doors, with a few sessions taking place in other planes. It was my first time playing a in specific D&amp;amp;D world, and not just one made up by the DM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the summer wore down we came upon the close of the campaign. I remember playing a bit in a van on the way to a tubing field-trip, then talking out-of-charcter the entire time we tubed down a river that day. The DM said we’d probably close out the game that day, and we played a bit more on the drive back to camp. That night we spent the night at the DM’s house, and finished our game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big surprise? We were the villains all along, and the game ended with our inevitable defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit cliche, but at the time it blew our tween minds.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Emergents: Genesis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/emergents/emergents.png&quot; alt=&quot;Emergents Art&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/11/emergents-genesis/&quot;&gt;first heard&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://urbanislandgames.com/emergents-genesis/&quot;&gt;Emergents: Genesis&lt;/a&gt; back in November of 2015 and was instantly interested in the game. Then, at PAX East this year, I finally had a chance to sit down and play the game. I also left with a copy to give it a proper review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergents is a comic book themed deck builder where 2-4 players get a hero and a starting deck. The deck building aspect is pretty standard fare. Buy cards using resources from your hand. Bought cards are placed in your discard pile. Once your deck is exhausted you then shuffle your discard pile and create a new draw pile. By now we’re all pretty used to these mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a combat mechanic built-in, like a few other deck-builders, but what’s unique about Emergents is a defend/counter system. I can attack another player, or play cards that would hurt them, but they can stop me from doing so by defending or countering with a tactic card. This makes the game a bit more interactive between players at a level that most other deck builders don’t have. Add in the individual player’s Heroes and their special abilities, and all the crazy card combinations available to play, and duke it out until there’s one player left standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t really talk about Emergents without discussing the amazing art. The game truly looks as if it were ripped out of the pages of a comic book. Of course this is to be expected with art from some amazing people in the comic industry like Jason Narvaez and Steve Ellis. The art on these cards is print-worthy, and I’d love to have some of these in poster form my for game room walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of deck building games, and Emergents is definitely in my top 5 in the genre. It’s a must have for deck building fans and comic book fans alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those interested in taking a look at the rules of the game, you can find them &lt;a href=&quot;http://urbanislandgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rulebook_sm.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Urban Island Games also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xt7MnqpN2dZqr5wFE1F5p4-zDwfDS0Y2gFKL8ygoC-I/edit&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; setup to answer frequently asked questions about the game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 9</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the game, what’s involved in an ideal setting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of things that are important to a great setting, but the absolute most important thing is preparation. A good GM should have a solid plan, and the players should have a solid grip of what’s going on headed into the game. Of course this still kind of falls into the realm of the game, but there’s items here that don’t. The play space should be organized, materials needed where they can be easily reached, drinks/snacks nestled away in safe areas away from the actual play space, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this won’t always be the case, but when it does all come together it can make an already great session sublime. I can’t say I’ve ever played an RPG where everything was setup perfectly and things went without a hitch, but I’ve been involved in some sessions that have come close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course sometimes it doesn’t even matter. Sometimes it’s just a good vibe that settles over everyone, and everything works out without any prep at all. It’s those rare sessions that are truly amazing, and are the ones we talk about for years after. I remember a pickup game of Vampire we played on night in college in a friend’s apartment. It was all so rushed. Characters quickly made, story made up on the spot, and nothing was planned. Still. Everyone was super chill, and had an amazing game, even though the actual story/play wasn’t on point.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Mega Man: The Board Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/megaman/promo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mega Man Board Game&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Mega Man. I grew up with Mega Man games, starting on the NES and playing them in all their sequels, spin-offs, and remakes throughout the years on various systems. As a kid I would put on my dad’s motorcycle helmet and run around pretending to be the Blue Bomber, stopping evil Robot Masters from helping Dr. Wily take over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I was &lt;em&gt;mega&lt;/em&gt; excited to see Mega Man: The Board Game hit Kickstarter. Though I didn’t end up backing the game, Jasco Games was kind enough to help me get my hands on the retail version of the base game along with the Time Man and Oil Man expansion. I was a bit bummed that I wouldn’t be getting the extra heroes and other plastic bits, but was still ecstatic when the game arrived in the mail. I refrained from reading reviews, watching gameplay videos, etc… so I could experience all the glory of Mega Man on my own terms. I took some &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Mega-Man-Unboxing/&quot;&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt;, then waited until I had a good amount of time to get it to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of George Takei, “Oh my.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying that Mega Man is a physically stunning game. All the pieces are well made, sturdy, and amazing looking. The only two exceptions here are the &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; challenge cards, and the colored dots used to differentiate the players’ Mega Man figures. The cards are smaller than the cards in the original Ticket to Ride. I have no idea what Jasco was thinking with these. The colored dot stickers were impossible for me to get off the sticker sheet, and I ended up tearing the thing in half trying to pull them off. I guess I’ll have to paint colored dots on the player figs, or just color their entire bases with some spray paint. All in all, the game is striking to look at, and play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only the rest of the game were as amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are written well enough, though hard to grasp in some areas. I had to reread the game setup several times, and constantly refer back to them. The rules also reference items that were only Kickstarter extras, and aren’t for sale to the public yet. It would have been nice to leave this info out, and include it only with the add-ons. Even with all that, once my kids and I got into the swing of things we were able to move through the game with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game states on the box that play-time is 60-90 minutes. This is an outright lie. It took about an hour just for the four of use to each take two turns. Granted it took a bit longer for us to get through our first turns, but our second turns were still really long even though we knew what we were doing at that point. None of us had even beaten a boss until around 90 minutes in. A more realistic time estimate for the game would be 4 hours, likely more if you add more players and the expansion in. Probably a bit more if you add the Yellow Devil piece into the game, which adds an extra boss fight before Dr. Wily…who you have to beat &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that the Yellow Devil doesn’t come with the game, even though he’s got a clearly marked spot on the board? He’s not even for sale yet, and I doubt he will be seeing as I don’t believe this game is going to do very well in the long run. Other player characters such as Roll, Proto Man, Dr. Light, and Rush were also only available via Kickstarter, and I doubt they’ll see the light of day for public sale either. I’m probably out of luck hoping to see Bass and Treble added to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mega Man is a push your luck game, and I feel like underneath it all there could have been a good game here. Everything just takes &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too long. A player flips a challenge, can play a card, other players can then play cards, repeat until no one can/wants to play more cards, then dice are rolled to meet the challenge and anything else added to it. Beat the challenge and you can try another one. Fail, and your turn ends. You also have an exorbitant amount of health to lose, and 3 lives you can lose before you have to start a boss’ level over again. Once you reach a boss your have to whittle down their extremely high amount of hit points to beat them and earn their Robot Power. You then have to do this all over again with another Robot Master before you can take on the Wily challenges and then fight Wily…&lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt;…to beat the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a slog, and gets pretty boring pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like Jasco would have had better luck pushing this as a 4-player game with 4 different player characters in the base box. Even then, the rules would need a complete overhaul to keep this game in the 60-90 minute range the box advertises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really a shame, because like I said earlier, it looks amazing. The game is begging for house rules to clean it up a bit so it doesn’t just gather dust on the shelf. I feel kind of bad for people who shelled out insane amounts of money getting all the extras and plastic bits during the Kickstarter campaign. Hell. I feel bad for those who paid full retail price for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Mega Man was discounted for review by Jasco Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 8</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you prefer hardcover, softcover, or electronic books? What are the benefits of your preference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not both (or all 3?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love the feel of a sturdy, hardcover RPG. It’s a wonderful, tactile experience from when the book is brand new all the way until it’s been worn down and time and play. I still have my original AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition Player’s Handbook from when I was 8-years-old. It’s falling apart, dog-eared, and neigh unusable at this point. Yet every time I pull it out and flip through it’s pages I can remember all the great games it served me through. On the other hand, I have a Collector’s Edition Vampire: The Masquerade with a leatherette cover that I never used for gaming, but kept on my shelf because it &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; so cool. It’s in great condition still, even though it’s a box in the basement now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Softcovers are great for their portability, (literal) flexibility, and cost. There’s also the fact that some RPGs just don’t come in hardcover. My copy of Dungeon World is softcover, and a great size to keep on my nightstand or in my bag when I travel. Back when I co-founded &lt;a href=&quot;http://tremorworks.com&quot;&gt;Tremorworks&lt;/a&gt; softcover was the only way we could get Sean Boyle’s HDL System books published. The cost was just too high to print hardcover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My least favorite of the three would be digital. I just have a hard time reading RPGs in a digital format without my head hurting or losing focus. RPGs on the Kindle look and read great, but the hardware is just too slow, and the interface too clunky, to really be useful. Digital RPGs do have one great advantage over physical books, and that’s search. It’s really easy to search a book, or multiple books, and get exactly what you’re looking for quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a place in every gamer’s shelf for all three formats, though I dream of the day where we can have affordable, full-color, 8.5x11 eReaders with amazing speed and controls.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 7</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What aspect of RPGs has had the most effect on you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about RPGs is the social aspect. People coming together to tell a story together and have a great time. RPGs have always filled a social need in my life. Playing at a friend’s house. Playing at camp since I wasn’t much into sports. Telling stories with like-minded individuals in high school. Playing with groups of great people in college, since the party scene was never my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s how I feel about tabletop gaming in general, but RPGs tend to bring out the fantastical in people. It transforms a basement/bedroom/living room into a completely different world. The players become more than just kids/teens/adults. They’re heroes. They’re villains. They comrades or foes. In the end, they’re all part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all about the people. It’s all about sharing those good times.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 6</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most amazing thing a game group did for their community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a short one today, mostly because none of any game group I’ve been part of has done anything for the community as a group. We’ve all done our own things, whether it be donating time, money, or items in need, but never anything as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great idea, especially for long established groups or public groups that allow anyone to attend and play. What better way to both spread the joy of gaming and help those in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing a bit of email tag now for almost a year with an organizer of the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simsburyabetterchance.org&quot;&gt;ABC program&lt;/a&gt; where I live, trying to setup a game day. I’m now going to give her an email again to see if we can connect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 5</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What story does your group tell about your character?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in high school my friends and I played World of Darkness games for a while. Mostly Vampire and Werewolf. While Vampire was our go to game that I usually GM’d, we would sometimes take a night to let one of my other friends GM a Werewolf story. This kid was a great GM, and always made stories interesting with lots of opportunities for us to do cool things. Werewolf was very generous with dice pools when you were in full werewolf form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember many of the details about how it was pulled off, but my character found himself locked in a museum and surrounded by mages. While the following battle really wasn’t overly special, the flow of the game had our group retelling the story of the mages’ demises for weeks after. I can’t even take the credit for it. I can’t say it was my play choices, roleplaying, or even luck of the die. It was all our GM, and how masterfully he let the situation play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end it was also the beginning of the end for our werewolf games. It felt like nothing could top the excitement of that entire night’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame, really. I remember loving the world of Werewolf.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HEX: Shards of Fate – Herofall Set Announced</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gameforge and HEX Entertainment have announced HEX’s upcoming fifth set, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.hex.gameforge.com/news.html?p=7711&quot;&gt;“Herofall”&lt;/a&gt;. The latest card set brings an additional 275 new cards to HEX: Shards of Fate, and is slated for release this fall. Alongside the new cards, we will see the first tournament based on the newly introduced ladder system in the “Cosmic Crown Showdown”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosmic Crown Showdown pits all the players who have reached the Cosmic tier against each other, with the top 64 from both the constructed and limited ladders being able to participate. Finalists are expected to be announced in August, with the first  Cosmic Crown Showdown starting in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the new set, 18 legendary cards and 20 new champions will be introduced, along with new sleeves. The conflict between HEX’s two factions—between the Ardent and the Underworld—will be in the spotlight for the new troops, actions and heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Attila</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/attila/attila.jpg&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; alt=&quot;attila&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blueorangegames.com/index.php/games/attila&quot;&gt;Attila&lt;/a&gt; is a 2-player strategy game from Blue Orange Games where players are try to force their opponent into spaces on the board where they can’t make a move. The two small game boards and two large game boards can be combined in any manner to create the play space. Each turn a player moves one of their three tokens similar to how a Chess knight moves (two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally). After a player moves they place scorched earth tile anywhere on the board. That space is now blocked off, and can’t be landed on by either player. Play continues like this until one player can’t make any more moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some things to keep in mind here. Pieces can move &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; scorched earth tiles, they just can’t land on them. Pieces can also move off the board as long as they can land on a legal space. That’s pretty much it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attila is a great little filler game, especially for families. It’s simple, portable, and comes in a cool tin. It’s also only $15. It’s the kind of game I’d except to find in mass market stores, though the quality of play is much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got kids, Attila is a great game to add to family game night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Attila was provided free for review by Blue Orange Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most impressive thing another’s character did?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/RPGaDay-Day3/&quot;&gt;Yesterday’s post&lt;/a&gt; had a lot to do with the story I’m going to write today. I gave a very vague overview of what transpired, but gave no detail. Let me shed some light on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem player in our AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition game was becoming a bigger and bigger problem. Eventually he started accusing the DM of lying and holding out information on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are the voices we hear hobgoblins? I speak hobgoblin!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, they’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to tell us if there are! I speak hobgoblin! I’d know! I want to roll to listen in on the hobgoblins.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are no hobgoblins.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d know if there where! I speak hobgoblin!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On, and on, and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I had said. One of the other players had enough, and decided he was going to take it upon himself to kill the problem character. After walking with the DM, and eventually the rest of the party, it was agreed that this attempt could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the most experience player, I would be the babysitter. The problem player and I split off from the main party into an alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hear something in there! Probably hobgoblins!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course he went blindly running into the alley with me, because he spoke hobgoblin, damnit! Meanwhile the rest of the party waited for us to play out our little alley adventure. Except not really. Our murderous player announces he’s going to roll to hit, as part of the pre-concocted plan. The rest of the party would be at the mouth of the alley as soon as we were far enough in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DM smiles, “You can take your shot, but Rob’s in the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem player is confused. Is our friend firing on hobgoblins? Where are they! He’d be able to hear them if they were there. By the gods! He speaks hobgoblin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it should have been an easy save for me, being a half-dragon ninja. Of course I was the WORST ninja there ever was, though my stats should have been good enough so I could dodge the ranger’s arrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murderer rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damnit. I’m going to die, or take some serious damage. I grab my die and, already defeated, half heartedly throw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No way. There’s no way. Everyone is gasping, “oh shitting”, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DM decides that’s it. He’s done. This session is going out on a high note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ranger looses his arrow and it flies down the alley, headed straight for my head. In a flash, I spin problem player around to face the arrow, dodge out of the way, and manage to get my hand behind the arrow with lighting fast speed. A quick thrust of my palm drives the arrow straight through problem player’s eye, felling him on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why the hell did you guys just do that to me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much excitement, pats on the back, and explanation of what went down to problem player, we help him roll up a new character. He agrees to chill, loves his new character, and sticks with us for many more weeks of awesome AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He never spoke hobgoblin again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character moment you’re proudest of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s prompt is a tough one, mostly because it ties in with tomorrow’s “Most impressive thing another’s character did?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I can give an overview today, and get into the gory details tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session was back in ‘99. We had gotten a group together at college to play AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition in my dorm room. My roommate at the time was the DM and there were around 3-4 guys other than myself, most who weren’t as experienced with RPGs as my and my roommate. One player in particular, the least experienced, was very … overzealous with his character. Everyone was fine with his questions about the rules, what he could and couldn’t do, and any other out-of-character help he needed. What they weren’t fine with was his portrayal of his character, who was obnoxious to the point of spoiling everyone else’s fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another player had enough. His character had to gotten rid of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My roommate and I talked about how to handle the issue, and we decided to let the player’s choice ride. Then it was time for some planning sessions with the other players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the overall experience is not one of my proudest gaming experiences, my character’s performance in the following plot was something to look back on with pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll fill in more details tomorrow. Hopefully I can retell the experience and convey the humor, excitement, and overall absurdity of the whole experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Elemental Mystics</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elementalmystics/elemental-mystics-a-mythological-expandable-card-g/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Kickstarter pick, already?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elementalmystics/elemental-mystics-a-mythological-expandable-card-g&quot;&gt;look this game&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t even look up how it’s played before I backed the project. I backed it purely on it’s design. Of course I went back and watched the “How to Play” video right after to make sure I didn’t make a horrible mistake. It’s a bit over the top, but gave me a good idea that I made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention that you probably don’t want to watch the actual Kickstarter video at top of the project page. It’s pretty … terrible. The video you want to watch is the one I’ve embedded at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can download the rules &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elementalmystics.com/uploads/6/4/0/0/64007259/rule_book.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elemental Mystics is going to be an Expandable Card Game (XCG), so if any cards are produced past this base set they’ll be available in pre-made sets instead of boosters. The project is hoping to raise $91,215, a lofty goal, so I’ll see if even the base set is produced before getting my hopes up for future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post Edited 8/11/16 9:36am. Project relaunched. Updated links and embeds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best gaming session since August 2015?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I stated in my first #RPGaDay post, I don’t play many RPGs anymore. It’s something I’m hoping to fix, but I need to find the time, the system, and the people to play. That being said, I still had a few experiences over the past year to draw from for the this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best session that comes to mind happened at PAX East 2016 at a table filled with small press RPGs. For the life of me I can’t remember what the game was called, and there’s no picture of the booklet in my collection of photos from the convention. What I do remember is that it was a small print run that was pretty much a PAX East exclusive, at least for now. The game had to do with lovers on opposite sides of a mech war finding each other and dealing with different scenarios that occurred during said war. These could be a dance, a skirmish, a treaty meeting gone downhill, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played a quick scenario with the designer, and really loved the give-and-take mechanic this little RPG used. I could say that I was going to the enemies camp to gather info, and he would choose to what varying degree I succeeded. Each of his choices came with it’s own consequence and benefits/pitfalls. Gameplay continued back and forth until one of us had to concede, and the scenario came to a logical conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was smooth, fun, sometimes humorous, and had me making choices that I wouldn’t normally make in an RPG. I wish I had bought the little book, or at least remembered something more about the name or designer so I could contact him and get a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully he’s there next year, and I can snag one for myself if there’s any left.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#RPGaDay 2016 - Day 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The past few years I’ve seen several people participate in #RPGaDay, an event in August where people write about a specific RPG-related topic for each day in August. It’s a great idea, but since I really don’t play many RPGs as much as I’d like to anymore I’ve just enjoyed reading everyone’s content without participating. Then I read Thomas Deeny’s, a fellow Pawn, &lt;a href=&quot;http://denaghdesign.com&quot;&gt;latest post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject, and how last year he used #RPGaDay as an exercise in writing. I figure I may as well give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real dice, dice app, diceless, how do you prefer to “roll?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that’s a loaded question, isn’ it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rpgaday/poly.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;dice&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;Growing up in the 80’s I cut my teeth on RPGs with AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition when I was about 8 years old. This meant I was used to roleplaying with lots of polyhedral dice. In fact, I still have my original set of dice (pictured left) stored safely in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wyrmwoodgaming.com/product-category/products/dice-vaults/&quot;&gt;Wyrmwood Gaming Dice Vault&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve always found rolling handfuls of dice highly satisfying. That, and there’s just something wonderful about a large, leather dice bag filled with all sorts of dice of varying size, sides, colors, and patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dice bring back fond memories of gaming, and my childhood. A chipped dice that was thrown after a bad roll, a lucky d20 with the numbers almost worn away from years of use, sets of dice that are so hard to read, but were just too pretty not to purchase. I remember my dad driving me to various hobby shops to see what AD&amp;amp;D books they had in stock, and to checkout their hoard of dice for sale. It’s something I’ve passed down to my kids. Both my 11-year-old and 6-year-old sons have started their own dice collections. My 9-year-old daughter has now expressed interest in starting one her own. The 2-year-old is a bit young, but I’m sure he’ll inherit the dice bug, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rpgaday/robbie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AD&amp;amp;D 2nd&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition taught me dice love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I love dice. Do I always need them? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dice serve their purpose, but there are times when they’re just not needed. Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://storium.com&quot;&gt;Storium&lt;/a&gt; for example. It’s uses a great system for roleplaying where dice are just not needed. Every year I see loads of tiny, small-press RPGs at conventions that barely have a rulebook, less use any dice. There was a great RPG a while back called Untold that only used cards, and had a great mechanic where your deck was your character and you took damage in the form of losing cards from your deck. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a system is fun it doesn’t matter if it uses dice or not. Yes, I love rolling dice. I love collecting dice. I love spilling dice from my bag and going through them with my kids, and surprising my kids with this or that cool dice I pick up at a convention. I also love streamlined or experimental systems where dice just aren’t needed. As long as I’m having fun, I’m cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as dice apps go? Blech. If you’re gonna roll, roll for real!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokemon Sun and Moon Z-Moves and More</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company International announced Pokémon Sun and Moon info today, including: new Pokémon, Z-Moves, Poké Ride, and the Island Challenge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for new Pokémon, a bunch were unveiled today, including some new variations on some classics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/oricorio.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Oricorio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oricorio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oricorio changes its form by sipping the nectar of certain flowers. Since it has four different forms—the same as the number of islands in Alola—it would seem that different Oricorio live on each of the islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baile Style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Fire/Flying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baile Style Oricorio is very passionate, and power fills its body when it dances. It sends downy fluff flying during its intense dances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pom-Pom Style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Electric/Flying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pom-Pom Style Oricorio is very friendly toward people, and it uses dancing to encourage Trainers who are feeling glum. When it dances, its feathers are charged with static electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pa’u Style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Psychic/Flying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pa’u Style Oricorio acts at its own pace, which sometimes makes it difficult to deal with. It sharpens its spirited moves through dance, which increases its psychic power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sensu Style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Ghost/Flying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sensu Style Oricorio is quiet and collected. By means of its dance, it gathers the spirits drifting about in an area and borrows their power to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Rock/Flying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minior are formed in the stratosphere and live by absorbing the detritus around them. When they’ve consumed a large quantity of particles, their bodies become heavy, and they fall toward the planet’s surface. Minior has a hard and heavy outer shell with a core within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gumshoos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Normal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gumshoos is the Evolution of Yungoos. It will call on Yungoos allies and stand in the way of trial-goers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fomantis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Grass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fomantis is nocturnal, and it performs photosynthesis while it sleeps during the day by spreading out its leaves in all directions. Because of the danger of staying in the same location two days in a row, Fomantis begins its search for the next day’s spot as soon as the sun sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lurantis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Grass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lurantis draws opponents near to itself with its flowerlike appearance and aroma—and then it takes them down. It’s said to be the most gorgeous of all Grass-type Pokémon, due to its brilliant coloration and elegant moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mudbray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Ground&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mudbray could once be found all over the world but is now a protected species. It’s said that the Alola region is the only place in the world where Mudbray can still be found in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/morenew.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More New Pokemon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Adapted to the Alola Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Pokémon have adapted to the distinctive microclimates of the Alola region and have taken on different forms than they have in other regions. These Pokémon are called regional variants. After taking root in the Alola region, they live like native Pokémon. These regional variant Pokémon can have different appearances and types, and their way of living can also differ from that of the forms previously known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/alolaold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alola Classics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Exeggutor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Grass/Dragon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other Exeggutor, the Alolan Exeggutor has a fourth head—on its tail! This fourth head controls the tail independently and can take on opponents to the rear that can’t be reached by the main heads’ attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Vulpix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Ice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said that Vulpix came to the Alola region together with humans, but the Fox Pokémon moved to the snowy mountain peaks to avoid the normal habitats of other Pokémon, and thus it ended up taking on this form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Ninetales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Ice/Fairy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alolan Ninetales is able to produce ice crystals from the fur that covers its body. It can use these ice crystals to block attacks, or it can form balls of ice, which it fires like bullets at opponents. These ice missiles have enough power to pulverize rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Sandshrew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Ice/Steel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandshrew have historically lived in desert areas, but the frequent eruptions of nearby volcanoes drove them to abandon the desert and migrate to snowy mountains where they took on this form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alolan Sandslash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Ice/Steel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alolan Sandshrew of the snowy mountains evolve into Alolan Sandslash with spiny backs that are covered in ice. Alolan Sandslash hide themselves in the snow when strong enemies appear, leaving only their needles exposed and ready for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Island Challenge, Z-Moves, and Poké Ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the tried-and-true Gym model that Pokémon has stuck to for years, the Alola region hosts an Island Challenge for their trainers. Each of the 4 main islands of Alola hosts a challenge to trainers, and it’s not always just a Pokémon battle. There may be items to find, or puzzles to solve. At the end of each trial, a mighty Pokémon known as a Totem Pokémon will be waiting. A Totem Pokémon is much larger than others of its species, and its body is enveloped in a special aura. When Totem Pokémon battle, they summon ally Pokémon to join them. With the support of these allies, the Totem Pokémon become more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final trial on each island is called the grand trial where Pokémon battle against the Kahuna who leads that island. Kahunas are chosen by the Pokémon known as guardian deities, which are also found on each island. If a trial-goer succeeds in clearing this grand trial, they will be publicly recognized as having cleared all of the island’s trials and can move on to the next island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z-Moves are a new element that has been introduced into the Pokémon battles in Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon. Z-Moves are powerful moves that can only be used once during battle. The explosive force of a Z-Move is the result of both the Trainer and Pokémon releasing their full power together when their wishes resonate with each other. All Pokémon are capable of using Z-Moves in battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Z-Moves, two key items are required: a Z-Ring and a Z-Crystal. The Z-Ring fits on a Trainer’s arm, and Z-Crystals are set into it. If a Pokémon holds the same variety of Z-Crystal as its Trainer, the two will be able to resonate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be a physical Z-Ring toy made by TOMY that will light up, vibrate, and play sounds along with the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, is Poké Ride. Pokémon and humans depend on each other for transportation in Alola more than any other region. The practice of Poké Ride is the result, and Pokémon that are not part of your team can be called upon in certain areas that are not accessible by human strength alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sunmoon/leaders.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kahunas and More&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Pages of War</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jkloudgames/pages-of-war/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pages of War is a game I previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/03/kickstarter-previewpages-of-war/&quot;&gt;previewed&lt;/a&gt; on Purple Pawn, and has just hit Kickstarter. There’s been a few changes since I’ve played, but apparently nothing so major that my impressions of the game should differ in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game you’re a bard telling the story of one of four great races:  The Men of Blue Mountain, The Orcs of the Black Hills, The Dragkins of the Cloudy Peaks, or The Elves of the Verdant-Wood. Throughout the game you’ll be forming ranks and clashing back and forth until you’re the lone victor. One great thing about the game is the lack of player elimination. If a player is defeated in a 3-4 player game they can lend their remaining troops to another play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pledge $1 to get a print-and-play version of Pages of War when it’s funded, or $29 to get the full, boxed game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the game when I tried it out back in March, and I’m looking forward to it funding and getting the see the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spellweaver - Valiant Dawn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dream Reactor has just released the first major expansion to &lt;a href=&quot;https://spellweaver-tcg.com/&quot;&gt;Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;, Valiant Dawn. The new set brings a load of &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.sparkpostmail1.com/f/a/0jjhaQGqN7nCZUHsJxEpaw~~/AACSLQA~/RgRZfjf6P0EIAKvNPj7RRJlXA3NwY1gEAAAAAFkGc2hhcmVkYQNuZXdgDTU0LjI0NC40OC4xNDJII1RoZSBWYWxpYW50IERhd24gRXhwYW5zaW9uIGlzIEhlcmUhQgoAAiu0m1fvHuQLUhNya2FsYWppYW5AZ21haWwuY29tCVEEAAAAAERGaHR0cHM6Ly9zcGVsbHdlYXZlci10Y2cuY29tL3ZhbGlhbnQtZGF3bi1leHBhbnNpb24tbWVjaGFuaWNzLWV4cGxhaW5lZEcCe30~&quot;&gt;new mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, 6 new heroes, new skills via shrines, and multi-aspect cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All booster packs have the possability of containing Valiant Dawn cards, even ones you previously have aquired but not yet opened. There’s also new Valiant Dawn Expansion Packs that only contain cards from the new set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spellweaver/vdawn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Valiant Dawn Cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 30th-31st there will be Release Celebration tournaments; 9 total, of which 3 will be free to participate in. Events start roughly every 3 hours. The full schedule is &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.sparkpostmail1.com/f/a/-aXk0GNoMgrnvEa2yhgzQg~~/AACSLQA~/RgRZfjf6P0EIAKvNPj7RRJlXA3NwY1gEAAAAAFkGc2hhcmVkYQNuZXdgDTU0LjI0NC40OC4xNDJII1RoZSBWYWxpYW50IERhd24gRXhwYW5zaW9uIGlzIEhlcmUhQgoAAiu0m1fvHuQLUhNya2FsYWppYW5AZ21haWwuY29tCVEEAAAAAERHaHR0cHM6Ly9zcGVsbHdlYXZlci10Y2cuY29tL2V4cGFuc2lvbi1jZWxlYnJhdGlvbi1ldmVudHMtYW5kLWRpc2NvdW50cy9HAnt9&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some unopened packs, and currency to buy some new packs, so I’m going to dig in tonight and get myself some new cards!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Arena of the Planeswalkers - Shadows Over Innistrad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of excitement in our house today as we just received our copy of Magic the Gathering Arena of the Planeswalkers: Shadows of Innistrad. It’s a new base game, so it can be played without the original boxed set. The Battle for Zendikar expansion is fully compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to like in this box. Great miniatures, awesome plastic structures, and wonderful art. The downside? Giant cardboard terrain, just like the original. It seems we’re never going to see masses of plastic hexes like we did with Heroscape again. The cardboard terrain is double sided, though, so there’s some nice variation there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll most likely be playing this over the weekend, so thoughts will go up shortly after that!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discovering Tak - Part 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest things about Tak is the open nature of the game. Cheapass Games provides the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cheapass.com/node/215&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; online, along with piece dimensions. People all over have been making their own Tak sets, and some of them are just awe inspiring. I’ve started keeping a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/rkalajian/tak/&quot;&gt;Pinterest Board&lt;/a&gt; with sets I like, but I figured I’d spotlight a few here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posted by reddit user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Shiddha&quot;&gt;Shidda&lt;/a&gt;, this board is simple, functional, and beautiful.  Simple wooden pieces on a stitched board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;imgur-embed-pub&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; data-id=&quot;a/neAWo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//imgur.com/neAWo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tevk/&quot;&gt;TevK&lt;/a&gt; created two different board with two different techniques. He provides instructions for both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tevk/27171427796/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tak/TevK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TevK Boards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is a really beautiful boxed set created by a reddit user that I can’t seem to find again (apologies!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;imgur-embed-pub&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; data-id=&quot;a/9lKd7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//imgur.com/9lKd7&quot;&gt;Tak Board - Created for me by my beautiful and amazing gf!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, my absolute favorite. Imgurian &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/user/AaronSchmersal&quot;&gt;AaronSchmersal&lt;/a&gt; created a board that’s both beautiful and thematic, using characteristics taken from the Kingkiller Chronciles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;imgur-embed-pub&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; data-id=&quot;a/9n950&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//imgur.com/9n950&quot;&gt;Tak Board Progression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still struggling to make a set that I’m happy with, but I don’t even have a fraction of the talent these fine folk have. I’ll just have to settle with what I have until the official sets come out in November.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pox Nora's 29th Expansion Launches July 27</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SIJSX4DuEjo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poxnora.com/index.do&quot;&gt;Pox Nora&lt;/a&gt; has been around a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time. I remember playing the game back in 2006 when it first came out. Now, on July 27th, Desert Owl Games will release the 29th expansion for the game. Planar Disturbances will add 49 new runes, including 32 champions and two limited-edition versions of existing runes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion will introduce a quest line that unveils a new threat lurking in the mountains of the mighty dragon Valdac. Those who brave this campaign will be rewarded with a limited-edition version of the fan-favorite champion, Commander Nisk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the release of Planar Disturbances, it was also announced that Pox Nora will be released for the PlayStation 4 and Vita in Q4 of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I need to dig back in and see what I’ve missed all these years!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Infinity Wars Reborn Coming to Steam</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Infinity Wars is a free-to-play CCG on Steam. As my readers will know, I’m a sucker for free CCGs, even if I only play each one for a short while. Sometimes you find a great one that sticks. I’ll be giving Infinity Wars a spin soon to see if this is one of those titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this year Infinity Wars will be getting a major update, and a name change. Infinity Wars: Reborn will contain over 100 new cards from the new Rebellion Set, the first in a wave of three sets totaling over 750 cards. You can actually play the Beta of &lt;a href=&quot;http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001BE1MCcg31kvC9mDg6BietPJAbTimThISkN-q6sios_b_t2EwOJvUr1Ig2_nxPUs8fU5dsywCfwfJswFPbMkOJn1ljiInazloq7W0jjxCE95-8JLl-_Z20EHO0HfI_1TW5PvKhVxVQfNVEyQ4WTsBT2ewhbYqflrm3LV-CyDRAriRwB_iTmiU5Dd0oE4_TXSWRDwPAW43Ydk=&amp;amp;c=aZHCvDXaOE3_L45izMFISjr92IzsqurVbk5mesioB6sHOGTAjAzGjg==&amp;amp;ch=8GMzshl9x1OpYWQASryU4ZZoVSU0JIhyinGv0_Cd6cJHpocaYu5z0A==&quot;&gt;Reborn&lt;/a&gt; on Steam now. An update this month just added 21 missions to the game’s single-player campaign to start ramping up for the full release, as well as a new PvP mode, and some Rebellion preview cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently downloading the game, and will stream some play of it soon. A full review will be up once I get a good feel for it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Originz Prototype</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got my hands on a physical prototype of Flavor Factions’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.originzthegame.com/&quot;&gt;Originz&lt;/a&gt;, and I couldn’t be more excited. Having played the game a fews times at both CT FIG and over &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Originz-Tabletop-Simulator/&quot;&gt;Tabletop Simulator&lt;/a&gt;, it’s great to have a copy of my own to try out with my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I had to take some pictures before sitting down and breaking in my copy, so here they are for your enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another game that I’ll be posting a full preview of on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; once its Kickstarter launches.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Aurora</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/aurora1&quot;&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; is a game about the evolution of a solar system that was entered into The Game Crafter’s Learning Games contest by Rampage Games. I got a chance to see it briefly at CT FIG, but now have my own copy to review and take some pictures of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything has a wonderful “space” feel, and it’s always great to see how far The Game Crafter’s components have come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have a review of this one up shortly, so make sure to keep an eye on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; to see when it lands.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Silver Case HD Remaster</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Grasshopper Manufacture Inc. has announced that they’re remastering SUDA51’s debut game, The Silver Chair, in HD, along with localizing the game in English for the first time. The first trailer for the game just hit YouTube, and contains scenes from the game’s first chapter, “Decoyman.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Silver Case is an interactive novel which progresses as the player solves various puzzles. The story revolves around the player, a member of a special forces unit called “Republic,” trying to uncover the identity of a serial killer made famous from The Silver Case killings 20 years prior. The killer, known only as Kamui, has resurfaced and must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grasshopper Manufacture has already opened store pages for the game on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/476650&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://playism-games.com/game/285/the-silver-case&quot;&gt;PLAYISM&lt;/a&gt;. It should hit this fall for $14.99. I’ll post an in-depth review once I get my hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Pokemon and Features Announced for Pokemon Sun and Moon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company International announced six new Pokémon today, along with a bunch of new features for Pokémon Sun and Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/sunmoon/morepokemon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Sun and Moon Pokémon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Wimpod&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Bug/Water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wimpod is the Turn Tail Pokémon. This Pokémon is a cowardly scavenger that eats or stores anything that’s been dropped in the sea meaning it is highly valued across the Alola region as a cleaner of the sea. Wimpod has the new Ability Wimp Out which causes this Pokémon to run away or swap out for another Pokémon when its HP drops below half in battle.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Bounsweet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Grass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bounsweet is the Fruit Pokémon which gives off a delicious aroma. This aroma has a calming effect on humans, so many people across Alola let them live inside their homes as an air freshener.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Comfey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Fairy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Posey Picker Pokémon Comfey picks flowers which it carries around with it. Comfey uses its soothing aroma to help treat people and Pokémon at Pokémon Centers and hospitals.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Mudsdale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Ground&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mudslade is the Draft Horse Pokémon with incredible power and stamina. Its legs are coated in a protective mud and its kick can destroy a car in a single blow. Mudslade has the Ability Stamina, a new Ability which raises a Pokémon’s Defense by one when hit by an attack.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Bewear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Normal/Fighting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bewear is the Strong Arm Pokémon that must never be approached carelessly. With its strong and highly developed arms and legs, Bewear loves to give crushing bear hugs that will split anything in two.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Mimikyu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Ghost/Fairy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Disguised Pokémon, Mimikyu lives its life constantly covered by its cloth. Mimikyu’s Disguise Ability allows it to escape danger from an enemy’s attack once, then its appearance changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New features for the game include and updated Pokémon Global Link to include Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon, as well as Online Competitions and Live Competitions that players can host. Online Competitions are played over the internet, while Live Competitions are setup for players who are all in the same location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for the first time ever, players will be able to increase attributes of Pokémon that have reached level 100. The new feature, Hyper Training, will be accessed by visiting Mr. Hyper and paying him in Bottle Caps, a new item that can be collected in the Alola region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, is the announcement that the mythical Pokémon Magearna, which is planned for distribution in North America later this year, will be distributed with a Bottle Cap held item.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Light of Dragons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/lightofdragons.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; alt=&quot;Odd World&quot; /&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/9317481/791540056?token=066e3700&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; for Roots of Mali, &lt;a href=&quot;http://suncoregames.ch&quot;&gt;SunCoreGames&lt;/a&gt;’ new base set, hitting tomorrow I figured I’d get my review of last year’s Light of Dragons up. Light of Dragons and Roots of Mali are both the same game, just with different tribes. The tribes in both games have different spells and innate powers, making them play completely differently. Both games are completely stand-alone, but can be mixed for varied gameplay. I’ll be posting a preview of Roots of Mali on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow, so this post will strictly be about Light of Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While seeming very thematic with amazing art and some lore in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://suncoregames.ch/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LOD_Anleitung_english-1.pdf&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;, Light of Dragons is actually a tactical, abstract game of positioning. Both players have identical sets of six-sided dice, each side containing the same 6 creatures. Throughout the game you’ll be moving, upgrading/downgrading dice, casting spells, and attacking your opponents forces. You’ll always know exactly what your opponent has on the board, what they can do, and how many dice they have left in reserve. With 100% of the information available to both players, it’s all about putting what you have to good use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal in Light of Dragons is to earn 10 Might Points. You do this by attacking your opponent’s dice. Defeat a level 4 creature, get 4 Might Points. Do so in one of the 3 rows on your opponent’s side of the board for +1/+2/+3 bonus points, depending on how close to their side of the board you are. Creatures can only attack creatures that have a lower value, with the exception being that level 3 creatures can also attack level 6 creatures. Creature powers and spells range from moving a different number of spaces. moving diagonally, splitting into several weaker creatures, forming barricades, moving through other creatures, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The units in Light of Dragons are powerful, and make for a fairly fast game. Many creatures focus on lowering the power of other creatures, getting more creatures on the board, and providing extra Might Points. As you’ll see in my preview of Roots of Mali tomorrow, this set plays &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; differently. My oldest son and I actually played Roots of Mali first and were amazed at how much faster Light of Dragons plays, and how different it feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really liked it. My oldest son is a huge fan of abstract strategy games, and took right to it. It took us both a bit of time to learn what each creatures can do, and how they work together, but really enjoyed the whole process. The basics of the game are really easy. The complexity comes from the tribe and its abilities. The mark of a good abstract is that it’s easy to learn/tough to master, and I feel this fits that pretty well. Add the beautiful art, excellent dice, and the scattering of lore in the rulebook, and I was hooked. My biggest complaint? &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Light-of-Dragons-Roots-of-Mali-Unboxing/&quot;&gt;The box&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a bit large and unwieldy considering there’s just dice, a small board, a rulebook, and summary cards inside. While it’s beautiful to look at, it’s not easily stored on my shelves with other games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that effect the game at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can snag Light of Dragons from SunCoreGames for $40, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/9317481/791540056?token=066e3700&quot;&gt;Kickstarter for Roots of Mali&lt;/a&gt; lands tomorrow, like I stated earlier. From the Kickstarter preview, it doesn’t look like they’ll be any special deals to get both games, so you’re not missing out on any savings by ordering Light of Dragons today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Light of Dragons was provided free for review by SunCoreGames&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Yashima</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenbriergames.com/main/index.php/project/yashima/&quot;&gt;Yashima&lt;/a&gt; is another Greenbrier Games release I have in for review. I first saw it at PAX East, and was instantly drawn to it by it’s art style and amazing looking miniatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The components are sparse, but top notch. The tiles are thick and sturdy, the miniatures of a high quality plastic, and the cards are nice and snappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a lot of good things said about Yashima, and I’m excited to dig in and see what all the hype is about!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Originz on Tabletop Simulator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The other night I sat down with Evan from Flavor Faction to play their super hero card game, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.originzthegame.com/card-types#!/page/418080/about-flavor-faction&quot;&gt;Originz&lt;/a&gt;. I had a chance to play this back during CT FIG, but this time I got to play over Tabletop Simulator to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=718481315&amp;amp;searchtext=Originz&quot;&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it play? Really well. All the cards look great, and the game plays like you’d expect. Evan and I had a great match, trading blows back and forth for quite some time before I finally slipped up and he got the upper hand. I’ll be posting a more indepth view of the game once Flavor Faction launches their Kickstarter. Until then, you can snag the module for TTS &lt;a href=&quot;steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=718481315&amp;amp;searchtext=Originz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll also need the &lt;a href=&quot;http://image9.photobiz.com/3850/20160708080528_214270.pdf&quot;&gt;rulebook&lt;/a&gt;, and you may want to watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0APCBxQQeE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;How to Play Video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160&quot;&gt;Tabletop Simulator&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $20 on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some screenshots from the game:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Odd World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/featured/odd-world.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; alt=&quot;Odd World&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxmind.com/games/1625-odd-world&quot;&gt;Odd World&lt;/a&gt; is a new release from FoxMind, developed by Jack Degnan. It’s a small, inexpensive card game with easy-to-learn rules, but with a little bit more than you’d expect from a kids’ title like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the game is simple: have the most points when the cards run out. Look a little deeper and you’ll see there’s a bit more to it. To earn points you need to have sets of matching planets. Not only that, but your sets have to have an odd number of cards to actually score. Have four planet Earth cards? That’s worth zero points. Have three, or five? You’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cards are set up in two equal piles at the start of the game. Each card back features two different planets. Only one of those planets is on the flip side. Players need to pick a card from one of the piles, decide to keep it or give it to another player, then the card is revealed. It’s a balancing act trying to keep your sets of odd numbers while trying to even out other players’ sets. In the end, it’s really quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve played Odd World with my 10-year-old, 9-year-old, and 6-year-old. They all enjoy the game, especially because it’s so easy for them to take out, set up, and play on their own. It’s a game I can play without cringing when they suggest it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only complaint? It would have been really nice to have different planetary facts on each card. It wouldn’t make or break anything, but it would have been a great touch to an excellent kids game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Odd World was provided free for review from FoxMind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - ABXY</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brokengames/abxy-0/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month ABXY has caught my eye. It’s marketed as a simple, 2-player game of monster battles. The overall design of the game is what really drew my attention, but then watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tb9lhvbGOs&quot;&gt;how to play&lt;/a&gt; video really gained my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABXY is all about out maneuvering your opponent. You’ve got 4 actions available to you, 2 of which you’ll play during a round. Some actions are changed my the monster you currently have out on the table. The end goal? Defeat the other player’s monsters. You can checkout the full rules &lt;a href=&quot;http://static1.squarespace.com/static/576d4c6715d5db6720905902/576e93a785c5bdef44e51ead/576e93a985c5bdef44e51eec/1466864553498/rules-image.png?format=original&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$15 gets you a copy of the game when the project ends, if it funds. There’s still a long way to go, but I’m really hoping this one sees the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Light of Dragons and Roots of Mali</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got a box from &lt;a href=&quot;http://suncoregames.ch/en/&quot;&gt;SunCoreGames&lt;/a&gt; containing their 2015 release, Light of Dragons, and their current prototype, Roots of Mali. Both look really top notch, and I should be playing them soon and posting my official review. Until then, here’s some pictures of what comes in each box. In all the following, Light of Dragons will be on the left of the pictures, and Roots of Mali will be on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that my copy of Roots of Mali is a preview prototype, so things can change between now and when the game is release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really impressed with the artwork, and the quality/feel of the dice with these two.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokemon GO Launched</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.PokemonGO.com&quot;&gt;Pokemon GO&lt;/a&gt; was released in the US for &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pokemon-go/id1094591345?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;. The eagerly awaited game lets you explore the real world for Pokemon that you can use to battle at Gyms and try and win control of them for your faction. Various real-world landmarks will host Pokestops where you can replenish items for free, or as previously mentioned Gyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokemon can be caught just about anywhere, and you can always see which ones are nearby. So far I’ve seen mostly common ones around, but I’m sure there’ll be some harder to find ones in areas of import, or on out-of-the-way hiking trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only just started playing, so I can’t really give my in-depth thoughts yet. Right now the initial excitement is high, but it remains to be see how much playability the game has, and how buggy or not it currently is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, get out there and Catch ‘em All!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dead Man's Doubloons on Tabletop Simulator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I had a chance to play &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekfevergames.com&quot;&gt;Geek Fever Games&lt;/a&gt;’ upcoming game, Dead Man’s Doubloons. The cool part? I got to play over Tabletop Simulator and Skype with the game’s designer, Jason Miceli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are unfamiliar, Tabletop Simulator lets you play tabletop games over the internet. It’s all manual, with very little bookkeeping built in. Jason spent a good chunk of time getting his new game &lt;a href=&quot;http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=709659224&quot;&gt;implemented&lt;/a&gt; in the system, and it’s now available through the Steam Workshop. How is it? Excellent. Everything looks and feels great, and gameplay is smooth (once you’ve gotten a handle on Tabletop Simulator’s controls.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to get much unto the game, itself. I’ll be writing my impressions up soon on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; around the time it launches on Kickstarter. My gut reaction? It’s a really good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested in giving the game a shot now, download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekfevergames.com/uploads/2/3/9/9/23991524/dead_mans_doubloons_-_rules_1.2.pdf&quot;&gt;rulebook&lt;/a&gt; and add in the Tabletop Simulator module from &lt;a href=&quot;http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=709659224&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll need a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160&quot;&gt;Tabletop Simulator&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s $20 well spent. You can probably even find Steam codes for it for less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some screenshots Jason took from the game:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Grimslingers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://press.greenbriergames.com/sheet.php?p=project_grimslingers&quot;&gt;Grimslingers&lt;/a&gt; just arrived in the mail yesterday, and I just had to crack it open. Everything from the box to the cards is beautiful, and I can’t wait to get this one to the table! I love the fact that it can be played quickly in versus mode, or can be played as a longer, 4 session co-op story mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenbrier has a history of some amazing looking games, and even though this comes in a smaller package than their usual fare, it still looks just as stunning&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discovering Tak - Part 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing my earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Discovering-Tak/&quot;&gt;Tak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Discovering-Tak-Part-2/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;, I figured I’d look into some Tak bots. Sometimes it’s nice to practice against an AI, and i’ve played with 3 pretty good ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one I tried, and it’s actually a newer AI, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cdbfoster/takkerus&quot;&gt;Takkerus&lt;/a&gt; by cdbfoster. It needs to be compiled in Rust of OSX and Linux, but there’s also Windows binary available to play. It’s text based, and you need to know &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Tak/wiki/portable_tak_notation&quot;&gt;Portable Tak Notation&lt;/a&gt; to play. I really like it, and it provides an excellent challenge. I have yet to beat the bot on Takkerus’ default setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nelhage/taktician&quot;&gt;Taktician&lt;/a&gt;, a bot written in Go by nelhage. It’s another text-based bot that’s a bit faster than Takkerus, has been around much longer, and is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too good a bot for me to play against with its default settings. I like it, but I like Takkerus better. It may just be because I tried Takkerus first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last, and my current overall favorite, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://playtak.com&quot;&gt;playtak.com&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a web-based, graphical implementation of Tak that allows you to play against several bots of varying skill and difficulty. Being graphical, it’s a bit easier to visualize without exporting PTN files and using something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsfiddle.net/bwochinski/043hpzwu/embedded/result/&quot;&gt;PTN Viewer&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I’ve logged more games with Takkerus, I can say with certainty that this will be my default for solo play from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to love Tak. I love playing with my kids. I love playing against bots. I love discovering the layered complexity of play. I look forward to November when the official sets come out, though I’m still working on creating better and better sets on my own before then. I’m currently testing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1546860&quot;&gt;new set&lt;/a&gt; of 3D printed pieces by Ingo Dellwig. Instead of printing piece-by-piece, each players’ set is done all at once. It’s taking about 7 hours, but my first 31 tiles came out great, with the second set currently printing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step is to create a nicer board on the lid of a wooden box I picked up at the craft store. I’m thinking of stenciling gears and dots on top. Gears for the 5x5 board, and the dots in between for 6x6 play. After that I think I’m going to try some wood and metal filaments for my printer to create better looking/feeling tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Wrath of Dragons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I first played &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catalystgamelabs.com/casual-games/wrath-of-dragons/&quot;&gt;Wrath of Dragons&lt;/a&gt; at PAX East this year. The giant fire-breathing dragon kind of caught my eye while at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catalystgamelabs.com&quot;&gt;Catalyst Game Labs&lt;/a&gt; booth, and I just had to request a demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is a Resource Destruction game where you’re trying to destroy the most stuff by the end of 6 centuries. It’s a fairly standard Euro, but comes together well for a really satisfying game. There’s a ton of crunchy bits inside the box, along with some great artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two words: Dragon Meeples.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Kodama</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Solis is an amazing game designer. I haven’t played a game of his that I didn’t like. A while ago Daniel had created a card game called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drivethrucards.com/product/139066/Kigi&quot;&gt;Kigi&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful game about painting the most lovely trees. It was self-published and sold through DriveThruCards. A while later Action Phase Games picked up the game, rethemed it, and had Daniel flesh it out and refine it bit more. Thus &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actionphasegames.com/pages/kodama-the-tree-spirits&quot;&gt;Kodama&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked the game up at PAX East this year, and absolutely love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what’s inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Gamer Deck 1</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1238697612/gamer-deck-1-mechanics/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though not what I plan to normally do, I’ve made a 2nd Kickstarter pick this month. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1238697612/gamer-deck-1-mechanics?ref=user_menu&quot;&gt;Gamer Deck 1: Mechanics&lt;/a&gt; is a card system/poker deck highlighting different game mechanics. It’s a standard card deck featuring game mechanics as a theme. The four suits are: Cards, Meeples, Hexes, and Pawns. Each card in a suits has a game mechanic that relates to its suit. Each card also has a die faced on it equal to its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cards can be used in many ways. You can use them as a standard card deck, or a mechanism for game design ideas. You could even come up with your own games using the cards and the information contained on them. They look beautiful, and I was lucky enough to get in on the early-bird special for a $6 deck. Even at full price, $12, it’s not too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamer Deck 1: Mechanics is already funded, and has 6 days left in the campaign. It’s a simple project, so there aren’t any stretch goals. What you see if what you get, and that’s OK by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has a September deliver date, but it’s expected to deliver earlier than that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Card Master Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having already signed up as an early backer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/05/card-master-up-on-prefundia/&quot;&gt;Card Master on Prefundia&lt;/a&gt;, I was excited to get a prototype in today to preview. For those unfamiliar, Card Master is basically &lt;a href=&quot;http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Triple_Triad&quot;&gt;Triple Triad&lt;/a&gt;, a popular card mini-game found in Final Fantasy 8. Not collectable, it’s a deck of 81 cards with the numbers on the sides only ranging from 1-3. The rules for the game are simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/cardmaster/cardmaster.png&quot; alt=&quot;Card Master Rules&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a huge Triple Triad fan. Having lost all my old physical cards a long time ago, and not willing to pay hundreds of dollars on eBay for more, Card Master got me excited. How does it stack up? Pretty well, though a bit more limited due to it’s non-collectible nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the fun of the original Triple Triad was having control over your deck. The random nature of the 5 card draw here means you can get stuck with a real stinker of a deck while your opponent snags some pretty sweet cards. A draft, or different set of draw rules would be a good idea to keep games a bit more fair. Then again, we’re only talking about the numbers 1-3 here, and with the Double, Adding, and Chain rules you can make just about any hand work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cardmaster/cards.jpg&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; alt=&quot;Card Master Cards&quot; /&gt;All in all I’m already having fun with the cards. The prototype deck I got is crude, but gets the job done. The final decks will look the same, but me professionally manufactured. Also, if people pony up the money when the Kickstarter hits, other monsters my be included on the cards. Right now only the standard Card Master blue and red monsters will be featured on every card. It almost makes me want to design my own custom deck with more designs, but I have absolutely no skill in doing such things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Card Master be worth it? Depends on the final cost of the game. I believe the Kickstarter can be successful when it launches, but the price needs to be right. I couldn’t see paying more than, say, $10-$12 for the game. If designer Jeff Hurcomb can make that happen, it’d be a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kickstarter campaign should be starting soon, so keep your eyes peeled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype Card Master deck was sent over free for preview purposes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Mystic Vale</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back during Toy Fair 2015 I saw an early set of notes for Mystic Vale at the AEG booth. To be more specific, it was rough information about the Card Crafting System, as the game was still early in development and didn’t even have a name or specific theme. Ever since that day I’ve been waiting for AEG to announce what the game would be. Then came the news about Mystic Vale. I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully AEG sent me a copy to review. I haven’t had a chance to play yet, but I snagged some pictures of what’s in the box. It’s not my best work, but it will give you an idea of what’s inside the box, and how the cards fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/mysticvale/mystic_storage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mystic Vale Storage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can see, there’s a lot of cards. There’s also a bit more room in the box for future cards. Let’s hope the game is popular enough to see those slots filled!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - VA-11 Hall-A</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I almost passed on the opportunity to review &lt;a href=&quot;http://waifubartending.com&quot;&gt;VA-11 Hall-A - Cyberpunk Bartender Action&lt;/a&gt;, a new game by Sukeban Games. Something about the logo caught my eye, and a quick lookup of the game had me hooked at the music. After that, I figured it couldn’t hurt to request a review code and give the game a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VA-11 Hall-A (pronounced Valhalla) is an interactive fiction game where you’re interacting with patrons in the VA-11 Hall-A bar located in Glitch City. By interacting, I mean making drinks. There’s no dialogue trees or branching menu options here. Everything plays out depending on the drinks you make. Sometimes you can loosen someone’s tongue by adding a bit more alcohol in the drinks. Sometimes it’s just remembering someone’s usual drink. Sometimes even the wrong drink can steer a conversation in a different direction. There’s multiple endings to the game based on your performance as a bartender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cast of characters is interesting. Some may seem pretty shallow at first, but the more and more you interact with the rotating customers, the more you get a feel for them and the city you all live in. VA-11 Hall-A tells an interesting story through fleeting conversations over the bar. Pair the great writing with the excellent soundtrack, cyberpunk visuals, and little details like checking the news, blogs, and shopping for the main character, Jill, at night, and you’ve got something pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/va11halla.png&quot; alt=&quot;VA-11 Hall A Screens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m only just a few hours into VA-11 Hall-A, but I’m enjoying myself immensely. The game has you reading more than anything else, but the world is so rich with much to be discovered. I’ve always enjoyed interactive fiction, but this one really hits a lot of great buttons to make it stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note though. This game is definitely made for adults. While there’s nothing graphic, there’s plenty of bad language and adult themes brought up in the conversations with VA-11 Hall-A’s patrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/&quot;&gt;snag the game&lt;/a&gt; now on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux for $14.99. Totally worth it in my opinion. You can also grab the game’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://garoad.bandcamp.com/album/va-11-hall-a-prologue-ost-sounds-from-the-future&quot;&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; over at Bandcamp for $4.99. Another worthy purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Steam key for VA-11 Hall-A was provided free by Sukeban Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discovering Tak - Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/Discovering-Tak/&quot;&gt;earlier Tak post&lt;/a&gt;, I figured I’d give my initial thoughts on the game. I finished my set, and have played more than a handful of the game, teaching 3 of my kids to play over our recent vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I’ve created my own box/board combo to store and play the game. Based off the beautiful Devi’s board, one of the most expensive tier rewards from the Tak kickstarter, I created the Tarbean Waterside Board, also known as Pike’s board. If you’ve read The Name of the Wind, you’ll get the joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tak/pikesboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tak Printed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played using the latest Beta Rules from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cheapass.com/node/215&quot;&gt;Cheapass Games&lt;/a&gt; site, which are well written, and contain lots of interesting tidbits on vocabulary and the traditions of Tak. It’s a wonderfully simple game to learn with more depth than you’d initially guess. In no time the kids and I were testing our newly found Tak skills and figuring out new and clever ways to win the game. I’m proud to say that each of my kids were able to best me at one point or another, and all in different ways. Each of them have their own play style, and I’m excited to see how they evolve over more play, and possibly moving to bigger boards (we play 5x5, but 6x6 and 8x8 supposedly provide much different gameplay and strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking on making a better set for myself in the future, possibly 3D printing new pieces using wood filament. I’d really love to make a nice board, or at least find a nice Chess board and create overlays and add diamonds to the intersections to be more like the Cheapass hybrid board. Of course I can’t wait to get my hands on an official set in November, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids and I are still very new to the game, but we’re all excited to play. Tak is an excellent game so far!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Designer Modifies Game Developer Barbie for His Wife</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mattel recently released a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.mattel.com/product/index.jsp?productId=99225426&quot;&gt;Game Developer Barbie&lt;/a&gt; after a pretty nasty snafu with a similar theme in a book back in 2014. Thankfully the new Barbie hits the nail on the head, and is a great doll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game Designer &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/marcusingames&quot;&gt;Marcus Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wearegamedevs.com&quot;&gt;wearegamedevs.com&lt;/a&gt;, wanted to get the doll for his wife. No problem, right? Not quite. Game Developer Barbie only comes in one skin tone (which wasn’t the tone he was looking for.) Being a resourceful guy, he fixed the problem and saved the day. Pics from his &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/marcusingames&quot;&gt;twitter account&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barbiefix.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Game Developer Barbie Fix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple fix that looks great. Unfortunately, he had to buy TWO dolls to get the one his wife wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Encounters! Bravest Warriors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I actually played Encounters! Bravest Warriors for the first time during PAX East 2015. It’s by new means “new”, but Catalyst sent me both decks to get a better look at along with some of their newest stuff after this year’s PAX East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is based off the popular Cartoon Hangover show, Bravest Warriors. It’s by the same guy who does Adventure Time, which is very apparent just by looking at the covers on each box. Encounters! Bravest Warriors comes in two decks: Red and Blue. The Red deck lets you play as Danny, Beth, Catbug, or Jelly Kid. The Blue decks lets you play as Chris, Wallow, Plum, or Impossibear. You can also combine both decks for up to 8 players, or just more monsters and items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bravestwarriors/BWRedBox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bravest Warriors Red&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bravestwarriors/BWBlueBox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bravest Warriors Red&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has a very Munchkin-like feel, though really doesn’t play like it at all. Each turn your pushing your luck my flipping monsters over and using rolled dice to meet the exact number on the card. The dice you use become locked, and cannot be used again until you’ve used ALL your dice to defeat monsters, which gives you all your dice back and has you start a new column of monsters. You can stop at any point an collect your rewards, or you can fail miserably and lose everything you’ve accumulated. There’s also a system that allows other players to jump in and help if you fail, or coattail off your earlier victories. You don’t get a say in this at all, though you’ll get a share of the rewards if their help is successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a really easy game to pick up and play, and it’s really enjoyable. Not being familiar with the show, I’m glad I looked at the cards before trying to sit down and play it with my kids. While there’s nothing terrible, there are some inappropriate cards for younger players. &lt;em&gt;Sexier Beth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Unicorn Strippers&lt;/em&gt; come to mind off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cool thing? You can play solo, which is always a nice touch when you can’t find anyone else to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At $12.99 for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.battlecorps.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=3471&quot;&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.battlecorps.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=3470&quot;&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; it’s a pretty good deal. Just one deck will provide you with quick, quality entertainment for quite a while. Packs easy, too, which makes it great to take with you when you travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copies of both Encounters! Bravest Warriors decks were provided free for review by Catalyst Game Labs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing King of Tokyo 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the 5th anniversary of the game, there’s a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iellogames.com/KingOfTokyo.html&quot;&gt;King of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; out with brand new artwork. The game is exactly the same as before, but got a facelift to match the upcoming mobile version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new version also sees two new monsters, Space Penguin (not really new to the game, but hard to find) and Cyber Kitty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KOT is a hot game in our household, and the new edition was met with much excitement by me and the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Oh My Gods</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gameworthylabs.com/games/oh-my-gods&quot;&gt;Oh My Gods&lt;/a&gt; is a game I first played at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ct-fig.com&quot;&gt;CT FIG&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve got a review of the game coming shortly, but I figured I’d take some pictures and get them posted before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there’s not much in the box. Don’t judge the game by that fact, though, as there’s a lot of fun to be had here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite little bonuses is the inclusion of both a book of tear-off check sheets and several cards that work with dry erase markers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Fallen Angel</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;563&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1928897770/fallen-angel-0/widget/video.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month I decided to back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1928897770/fallen-angel-0?ref=hero_thanks&quot;&gt;Fallen Angel&lt;/a&gt; by Asteria Board Game Creation. It was a tough call, as there’s some really great projects out there right now. Fallen Angel has a few things going for it. The game itself sounds really interesting, has great looking components, is affordable, and comes with a dice tower!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fallenangel/fallenangel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game as a very sci-fi meets fantasy look and feel, and the mechanics revolve around rolling dice and using the results to take various actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about all I have to go on right now. Undead Viking has done a review explaining the game a bit more, but I’m holding off watching it until I can play and get my own feel for it before writing my own review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of right now Fallen Angel is almost fully funded. With 20 days left to go, I’m sure this one’s in the bag. Rewards should be shipping in November of this month, so hopefully I’ll be able to do an unboxing and review then.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Haiku Warrior</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some may know Jason Anarchy as the designer of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drinkingquest.com/games/drinking-quest-journey-into-draught-preorder-price-5-off&quot;&gt;Drinking Quest&lt;/a&gt; the card-based, drinking RPG. Jason has a new game, Haiku Warrior, that’s similar, but much more subdued. It can be played solo, or up to four players. The cards still drive the adventure, and every card carries a haiku. Jason told me at PAX East that he wanted to make a solo variant for Drinking Quest, but the thought of people drinking alone was too depressing. Hence, Haiku Warrior was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/haikuwarrior/haiku-contents.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Haiku Warrior&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game starts by choosing a character. Each character has their own stats and special power. Info is recorded on your character sheet and then you start flipping cards off the quest piles. There’s 6 main quests, and a free expansion that contains haiku written by Jim Zub, Ryan North, Becky Cloonan, “Fearless” Fred Kennedy, Masked Intruder, Lunar Baboon, Rock Paper Cynic, Parry Gripp, MC Lars, Robin Laws, and more. The number of quest cards you need to best before moving onto the next quest varies by number of players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/haikuwarrior/haiku-hats.png&quot; /&gt;If a card contains a monster, you fight it. Combat is dice driven, and fairly simple. If you beat the monster you get gold and souls. Gold is used to buy better equipment, fruit, and other buffs at the start of each turn. Souls are accumulated towards victory. It’s a balance between pushing your luck, inventory management, and luck of the draw. You can also draw cards that have you forage for food, or raid treasure. Pass a save roll for free fruit, hats, or boots. Hats and boots give you special abilities, and have the added cool factor of fitting over your character card to make it look like your character is wearing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’ve reached the amount of souls needed for victory, you win! Of course you can keep going to see how far you can make it through the game. You can also try the expansion quest, which is more like a hard, monster-only dungeon, instead of the main quests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only played the game solo, and I really enjoyed it. It’s light, easy to play, and portable. I keep my copy at my desk at work so I can play a few times over lunch. I’m hoping to rope some of my coworkers into a game soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Haiku Warrior sounds interesting to you, it’s available for $25 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drinkingquest.com/games/haiku-warrior&quot;&gt;Jason’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Haiku Warrior&lt;br /&gt;
A jovial RPG&lt;br /&gt;
Worth its price in fruit”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Haiku Warrior was provided free for review by Jason Anarchy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discovering Tak</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cheapass games wrapped up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cheapassgames/tak-a-beautiful-game&quot;&gt;wildly successful&lt;/a&gt; Kickstarter to bring Tak to life. For those unfamiliar, Tak is a fictional game in Patrick Rothfuss’ novel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/books.asp&quot;&gt;A Wise Man’s Fear&lt;/a&gt;. Though the mechanics of the game are never laid out in the story, James Ernest set it upon himself to bring the abstract game to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m eagerly awaiting my copy of the game, but until then I decided to 3D print my own set using models &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1042991&quot;&gt;designed by ts52&lt;/a&gt; on Thingiverse. I’m currently in the process of printing the regular, non-grooved pieces. I’m using my Solidoodle Press since it’s faster than my Micro 3D, and since there’s not a lot of fine detail it’s doing a fine job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few pics of my process so far. I’ll be sure to post the finished product once I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tak/takpieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tak Pieces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: I’ve finished! Just a paper board for now, but it’s enough to play at 5x5 game!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Hex Shards of Fate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another free-to-play, digital CCG, Hex: Shards of Fate attempts to combine CCGs with MMOs. Players navigate through the world and narrative battling anything that stands in their way. It’s very familiar to veteran CCG players, using gems as energy to cast cards. Each gem adds to your total mana count, but each color adds to your color level. This means that a ruby and diamond give you two mana, and 1 level in red and 1 level in white. It’s pretty easy to pick up on once you play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about where the ease of play stops. Hex is complex. Almost needlessly so. Hex has a priority system that lets players interrupt each other at pretty much every step during a turn. The interface for this is a bit clunky, with players always having to hit the “Pass Priority” button. Combine that with mediocre starting decks and an insanely hard AI, and Hex is just an unforgiving game to get into. I’m guessing this tactic is used to make you purchase better cards, but there’s no way I’m spending money on a game that doesn’t even give me an inch in the first 15 minutes of play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hexpriority.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pass Priority&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that Hex doesn’t dole out free stuff nearly as generously as other digital CCGs. They &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want you to spend money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s people out there who love Hex. Hell, I might even like it if it gave me a bit more wiggle room to breathe. Unfortunately a complicated system with crappy starting cards, a hard as hell AI, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a really clunky interface means that I’ve already moved on to bigger and better things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just way too many digital CCGs out there, and so far I’ve enjoyed just about all of them more than Hex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pass Priority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokemon Alola Region and Legendaries</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company has released more Pokémon Sun and Moon information today, including information on the Alola Region, Legendaries, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon take place in the Alola region, which centers around four tropical islands and one artificial island. When the main character moves to Alola, the story begins. Players will customize their character, choose their starter Pokémon, and jump straight into the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/sunmoon/alola.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alola Region&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more information on the new Legendary Pokémon, Solgaleo and Rowlet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Solgaleo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Category: Sunne Pokémon&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 11′02″&lt;br /&gt;
Weight: 507.1 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Psychic/Steel&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Full Metal Body&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honored as an emissary of the sun since ancient times, Solgaleo is referred to with reverence as “the beast that devours the sun.” Solgaleo’s body holds a vast amount of energy, and it shines with light when it is active. It has a flowing mane with a remarkable resemblance to the sun. Its signature move is Sunsteel Strike, an attack that charges at an opponent with the force of a meteor, disregarding the target’s Ability. Solgaleo’s Ability is Full Metal Body, a new Ability that no previous Pokémon has had. With the Full Metal Body Ability, a Pokémon’s stats will not be lowered by the effects of an opponent’s moves or Ability.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Rowlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Category: Moone Pokémon&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 13′01″&lt;br /&gt;
Weight: 264.6 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Psychic/Ghost&lt;br /&gt;
Ability: Shadow Shield&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since ancient times, Lunala has been honored as an emissary of the moon. Referred to with reverence as “the beast that calls the moon,” Lunala is constantly absorbing light and converting it into energy. With its wings spread to absorb the surrounding light and glittering like the crescent moon, it resembles a beautiful night sky. Lunala’s signature Moongeist Beam attack releases an ominous beam of light that disregards the target’s Ability. Lunala’s Ability is Shadow Shield, a new Ability that no previous Pokémon has had. With the Shadow Shield Ability, a Pokémon will take less damage from an attack that lands when the Pokémon has full HP.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/sunmoon/sunmoon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sun Moon Pics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New characters were revealed as well, including the new Professor, Kukui. In Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon, Professor Kukui provides a special Pokédex known as the Rotom Pokédex. It is inhabited by Rotom, a Pokémon with the power to reside in various electronic appliances. The Rotom Pokédex does much more than record Pokémon info—it has its own personality. Besides showing the player’s current location and their next destination, the Rotom Pokédex also provides advice on where to go next, based on the conversations players have with other characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also see Lillie, the professor’s assistant, and Hau, one of the main character’s first friends on Alola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, Sun and Moon will include a QR reader players can use to get information on Pokémon they haven’t caught yet. I’m curious to see if this aspect will contain clues on how to catch more elusive Pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Storyline Fairy Tales</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having just written a review for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/05/second-look-storyline-fairy-tales/&quot;&gt;Storyline: Fairy Tales&lt;/a&gt;, I figured I’d take the time do take some unboxing photos. The game doesn’t contain much except cards and tokens, but the production value is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about Storyline is how the Narrator Cards and Story Cards combine to look like pages in a book. Combine this with excellent fairy tale artwork, and a party game mechanic made into a kids game, and Storyline is an excellent way to spend time with the family.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Triple Triad on Mobile</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a fan of Triple Triad ever since I first played it in Final Fantasy 8. I even bought some physical cards back in the day, though I have no idea whatever happened to them. I hit a bit of nostalgia for the game when I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/05/card-master-up-on-prefundia/&quot;&gt;Card Master&lt;/a&gt; over on Purple Pawn the other day. Card Master is basically just Triple Triad with a different theme. I need it. Let’s move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not having access to a copy of Final Fantasy 8 anymore, I did a search to see what my options were. Lo and behold I come to find out there’s a new version of Triple Triad for mobile phones bundled in Square-Enix’s (mostly ad filled) app, Final Fantasy Portal. The gameplay is the same with some added rule variations. Also, cards now span across every Final Fantasy title, not just characters and monsters from 8. It’s just as much fun as I remember, with the exception that you only get 5 plays until your crystal meter refreshes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup. It’s Freemium. You can play all you like if you’re willing to wait for you crystal meter to recharge, or you can buy more crystals if you’re impatient. It’s a crappy model that anyone who plays games on a mobile device is familiar with. It’s a shame, really. I’d pay for a stand alone, full Triple Triad game. As it stands, I’ll take what I can get. Even if it is wrapped in an app that’s mainly geared towards advertisements and my play is limited to a few rounds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can snag the Final Fantasy Portal app on both &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-portal-app/id933149812?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.ffportal_w.googleplay&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to see me play a few battles, check out my recordings of two different streaming tests below. I’ve finally figured out how to stream off my phone, though the first time I didn’t think and streamed in portrait mode. The first test was streaming to YouTube live, while the second was streaming to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitch.tv/rkalajian&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9ZXlVgLyLY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

        <title>New Pokemon GO Details Revealed</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;More details for Pokémon GO came out from The Pokémon Company and Niantic, Inc. today, including information on the battle system, a new peripheral, and microtransactions. The game has also entered a closed-beta phase while it’s still being developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pokémon GO players can catch Pokemon at real locations using their phone. Pokéballs and other special items used to capture Pokemon and battle can be found at places of interest: museums, historical markers, and monuments. Pokémon Gyms will also be scattered across real life locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/goscreens.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pokémon GO Screens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s Pokémon without Pokémon battles? Players can battle using the Pokémon they’ve caught to gain control of a Gym. By using their own Pokémon’s attacks and dodging incoming attacks by swiping left and right on the screen, trainers can defeat the defending Pokémon to reduce the Gym’s Prestige. Once the Gym’s Prestige is depleated, the defending team loses control of the Gym, and the victor’s Pokémon can be assigned to defend the Gym. Gyms allow players to train their Pokémon and earn the Gym more prestige. The more prestige, the better the training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also announced was the Pokémon GO Plus, a device that connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth and notifies the player about events in the game using vibration and and LED. It’ll also allow simple controls to catch Pokémon using a button on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, is the microtransaction aspect of the game. Pokémon GO will be free to play, and like I said earlier, you can find items scattered around landmarks. You can, of course, buy in-game currency to purchase more items without having to search for them. It’s nothing new, and it’s just something people have come to expect from the mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Cthulhu Realms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;floatimageleft&quot; src=&quot;/images/cthulhurealms/realms1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cthulhu Realms&quot; /&gt;A few days ago &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitewizardgames.com&quot;&gt;White Wizard Games&lt;/a&gt; provided me with a review code for the Android version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whitewizardgames.cthulhurealms&quot;&gt;Cthulhu Realms&lt;/a&gt;, the Lovecraftian re-theme of &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starrealms.starrealmsapp&quot;&gt;Star Realms&lt;/a&gt;. Eager to give the game a shot, I immediately downloaded the game and dug in. If you’ve played Star Realms, there’s nothing really new here gameplay wise, yet the amount of detail put into Cthulhu Realms is truly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app boasts the game features as the Star Realms app. Single player campaign, online play, vs AI, and pass-and-play. The level of polish is top notch, the music eerie and unsettling, the art a mix of comedy/horror. The interface is tight and smooth, never getting in the way of gameplay, and provides an overall satisfying experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cthulhurealms/realms2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cthulhu Realms Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fans of Star Realms who are also into Lovecraft, Cthulhu Realms is a no brainer. While I’m more partial to the Sci-Fi theme, I’ll be keeping Cthulhu Realms around for my kids, who really get a kick out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download Cthulhu Realms for free and play a bit of the single player campaign. The full game is only a $4.99 purchase to unlock everything else, and more than worth that price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of Cthulhu Realms for Android was provided free for review by White Wizard Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Awaiting Pai Sho</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since gamers saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2010/09/pai-sho/&quot;&gt;Pai Sho&lt;/a&gt; played on Nickelodean’s Avatar: The Last Airbender, they’ve been coming up with ways to play. Pai Sho, in a playable form, has come a long way. There’s been many rules sets, and even tile sets, and lots of people have made their own boards and pieces. You can find a bunch on Etsy, but one of the most impressive sets I’ve seen comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lyrislaser.com/product/pai-sho-board/&quot;&gt;Lyris Laser Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Their full set includes a board, two sets of tiles, and a beautiful wooden box to store the tiles in. The best part? I’ve got a set on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/paisho.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pai sho set&quot; class=&quot;floatimageleft&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Soon I’ll have one of the nicest Pai Sho sets I’ve seen, and I’ll finally be able to enjoy a game I’ve been reading about since 2010. While there’s may rule sets out there, the one I think I’ve settled on is &lt;a href=&quot;https://skudpaisho.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Skud Pai Sho&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an attempt to take the best ideas from multiple rule sets an combine them into a simple, sophisticated set for maximum playability. It also uses the Wiki Pai Sho tile set, which happens to be the set I’m getting from Lyris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I wait patiently for my set to show so I can play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. Not so patiently. I really can’t wait for it to get here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come once I’ve had a change to play. I’ll make sure to get some good pictures, and a full review of the Skud rules.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - New BCW Products</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every once and a while BCW shoots me some samples of their new products to take a look at. It’s nice, seeing as I’m a huge fan of their line of stuff, and we can always use some new deck boxes, card protectors, and folios in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around they sent me a deck box filled with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcwsupplies.com/cat/deck-guard-m80-teal&quot;&gt;80 teal, double matte deck guards&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcwsupplies.com/cat/board-game-sleeves-45x68&quot;&gt;45x68mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcwsupplies.com/cat/board-game-sleeves-41x63&quot;&gt;41x63mm mini card sleeves&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcwsupplies.com/deck-case-locker-lt-brown&quot;&gt;Deck Locker LT&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcwsupplies.com/deck-case-commander-locker-lt-brown&quot;&gt;Deck Commander LT&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcwsupplies.com/cat/card-game-supply/card-folder/9-pocket-zipper-folio-lt-brown&quot;&gt;9 pocket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcwsupplies.com/cat/card-game-supply/card-folder/12-pocket-zipper-folio-lt-brown&quot;&gt;12 pocket Z-Folio LT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the sleeves are high quality, tough, and fit cards snugly. The Folios are leatherette, with a zipper, side loading sleeves, and can handle cards with or without sleeves. I’ve already reviewed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/04/second-lookbcw-deck-locker-play-mats-inner-sleeves-and-more/&quot;&gt;Deck Locker LT&lt;/a&gt;, and the Deck Commander LT is pretty much the same thing, but will hold at 100 card Commander deck. The biggest difference between the LT line of products and the LX is the faux suede interiors, which is a nice touch. It rounds out BCWs line with a choice of a luxury product that’s a set up from the already impressive LX line of leatherette items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BCW continues to put out a quality product at a great price. As I’ve said before, you’re looking at similar, or better, quality than Ultra Pro products, for a lower price. BCW continues to be my brand of choice for sleeves, deck boxes, and folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/BCW.png&quot; alt=&quot;BCW Products&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samples of BCW’s new products were provided free for review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Total War - WARHAMMER Stream</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was lucky enough to receive and early access copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/&quot;&gt;Total War: WARHAMMER&lt;/a&gt; for review/streaming. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/rkalajian/v/67447447&quot;&gt;quick stream&lt;/a&gt; of the game’s Campaign Mode using the Empire and running through the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve exported the video to YouTube. It runs about 19 minutes long, and you can watch me play while having no idea what the hell I’m doing. The tutorial wasn’t much help, but I think I just need to play the game a bit more. Once I do, I’ll be sure to get a review up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHeQdCFJkHo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strike&gt;Now for the fun part. Want a copy of the game with the DLC before it comes out? Comment on this post and I'll pick a winner by 5pm EST tomorrow!&lt;/strike&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A winner has been chosen! Bryan Roos! Get me your email address and I’ll shoot you the Steam keys. Congrats! Thanks everyone who participated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Long Road Ahead</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;/Drowning&quot;&gt;yesterday’s post&lt;/a&gt; I decided to sit down and take inventory of everything that’s come in recently. In line with my estimates, I’ve got 50 games on the dot that need to get played and reviewed. Again, this doesn’t include games already played, digital titles, toys, or gaming accessories. There’s a long road ahead, but I’ve already started planning &lt;strong&gt;r_day&lt;/strong&gt;, and am hoping to lock down a date and location soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the latest additions to the list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Battle for Zendikar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Hasbro&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Mega Man&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Jasco Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The Rose King&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Kosmos&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cryptazoic&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Storyline&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Asmodee&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Aurora&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Rampage Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Perspective&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sun Moon &amp;amp; Stars&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Minion Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Odd World&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fox Mind&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;san.ni.ichi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ironmark Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bravest Encounters&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Catalyst&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Jarl&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Catalyst&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Mix Match &amp;amp; Robbers&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Haba&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Space Planets&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Haba&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Tambuzi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Haba&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Pixel Glory&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Whatz Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Epic&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;White Wizard&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ophidian Wars&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cave Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Japanese the Game&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Japanese the Game&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ravens of Thri Sahashri&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Osprey Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Haiku Warrior&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Jason Anarchy&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Three Cheers for Master&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Atlas Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Fhtagn&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Atlas Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Boomtown Bandits&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Breaking Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Emergents: Genesis&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Urban Island&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yashima&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Greenbrier Games&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Paperback&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Tim Fowers&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Burgle Bros&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Tim Fowers&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fugative&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Tim Fowers&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more on the way, too, plus a few requests I’ve put out for Kickstarter prototypes of games I’m especially interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to knock off some of the lighter card games this weekend, getting a game group going at work, and possibly setup a few “play dates” in the next few weeks. I’m thinking &lt;strong&gt;r_day&lt;/strong&gt; may have to wait until later in June or early July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a long road, but that doesn’t mean it won’t be a good time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Drowning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of games to review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a look at my review queue and counted 23 unplayed games on there. That’s actually not too bad for me. It means I’ve gotten a lot off the list in a good amount of time. Unfortunately I haven’t updated the list since PAX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took home 13 new games from PAX, and have had steady shipments of games arriving in the mail since. I also took home 2 new games from CT FIG, with more in the wing from there, too. Not to mention normal review requests coming in from PR contacts from various companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t sat down to update my sheet and get an accurate number, but I’m guessing my queue will grow to around 50 games. That number doesn’t include digital games, toys, and gaming accessories. Oh yeah, I’ve also got 12 games that &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been played, and are waiting on a write up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason I started A Pawn’s Perspective was to give me another outlet to review things. I’m limited to the amount of review items I can post on Purple Pawn at a time. being it’s mainly a news site. That being said, I can’t go back and tell people the review they thought they were getting on Purple Pawn will now be posted here. I need to get through my backlog, post the reviews on Purple Pawn, and start setting up reviews with the expectation that they’ll be posted here in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s a guy to do when he’s got too many games to play? Start a convention! Of course not a real-deal convention, but more of full day of gaming with invited friends, designers, and local publishers. Preferably in a hall or someplace that can accommodate a good sized group to people for a full day of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s how my wife and I came up with the idea of &lt;strong&gt;r_day&lt;/strong&gt;. A day of gaming with Rob (that’s me) to play as many games in my review queue as possible. I’d hope I could at least get through a good stack of my queue in a day, and even if I couldn’t, it’d be a fun thing to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a lot of planning to do, then a lot of invites to send. If it works, it’d be awesome. I’m starting to drown in new games.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review - Spellweaver</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/05/spell-weaver-dlcs-now-available-on-steam/&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about the release of the two new Spellweaver DLC packs, I realized I had never gotten around to actually reviewing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spellweaver feels like a mix of &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/&quot;&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.hex.gameforge.com/landing.html?kid=a-94345-02245-1508-b3507172&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjw3-W5BRCymr_7r7SFt8cBEiQAsLtM8knD5UmqmRsnaqaV3raaeucps_HFRrQROeZPbMlTAiYaAk8x8P8HAQ&quot;&gt;HEX&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://magic.wizards.com&quot;&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/429680/&quot;&gt;free-to-play&lt;/a&gt;, but supports microtransactions and DLC packs if you’re looking to expand your collection quickly. Of course you can unlock cards through play, and Spellweaver actually gives you some pretty great deck-building opportunities with just common and uncommon cards. There never really feels like there’s a &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to purchase cards in casual play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplay is similar to other CCGs. Each turn you can play one Shrine to either give yourself +1 Mana, or a level in whatever faction the Shrine represents. To use a card you’ll need to have the appropriate mana to pay for the card, but also the appropriate faction level. Mana gets each turn depleted when it’s spent, levels do not. There’s also two rows you can play your cards in, front and back. The back row is mostly for support cards, but there are cards that can deal some combat damage from back there. You’ve also got 1 Hero card which provides a spell ability that can be used for a cost. Additional abilities can be given to a Hero through special Shrine cards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spellweaver/spellweavercards.png&quot; alt=&quot;Spellweaver Cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I went into Spellweaver rather skeptical, but found myself really enjoying the game. The interface is smooth and pleasant, and there’s plenty of opportunities for both single-player and mulitplayer play. Dream Reactor even runs tournaments with cash prizes, though I haven’t entered any of these, nor will I probably ever do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a great collection of cards already, thanks to some free in-game currency provided for this review, and I’ve gotten a good feel of some of the six factions (Order, Wisdom, Nature, Rage, Dominion, and Corruption). Wisdom and Corruption really make for some nice decks, though I’ve seen some really amazing deck combinations from every faction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really you can’t go wrong with Spellweaver. Being free-to-play, the only thing you’ll really lose if you don’t enjoy it is some time. While it may not rise Magic or Pokemon in my eyes, it fits in a solid 3rd place over many other CCGs, including Hearthstone. I’m a big fan, and I can’t wait until June when new cards are finally released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spellweaver/spellweaver-screens.png&quot; alt=&quot;Spellweaver Screens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital in-game currency was provided for review purposes by Dream Reactor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Monarch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Flanagan, designer and publisher of Monarch, sent me a prototype of the game while she was Kickstarting it a while back ago. Immediately I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/03/kickstarter-previewmonarch/&quot;&gt;hooked&lt;/a&gt;. Gameplay is simple, fast, and tight. Back then most of the art for the game hadn’t been finished, so there was a lot of placeholder art on the cards, tiles, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 years ago at Toy Fair Mary was at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiltfactor.org&quot;&gt;Tiltfactor&lt;/a&gt; booth and happened to have some of the art on her laptop. To say it was amazing is an understatement. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kateadamsillustration.com/&quot;&gt;Kate Adams&lt;/a&gt; created each piece of art on scratchboard tiles. These tiles were then scanned and colored for the game. The effect is stunning, giving Monarch a one-of-a-kind look and feel. Combine this with overall high production value, and the already high quality play, and Monarch is a treasure for any game collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the bit of glare in the photos. I was trying a new photo setup with a cooler light and a vinyl mat instead of cotton sheet. I need to diffuse the light a bit to reduce the glare. At least it’s working better than my previous setup!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kickstarter - Avoid the Void</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geekfevergames/avoid-the-void-a-board-game-of-chaos-and-survival/widget/card.html?v=2&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I don’t regularly do is back Kickstarter projects. Sure, I cover plenty of them for &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;, but I generally ended up getting them for free for writing such coverage. I’d like to change that a bit here on A Pawn’s Perspective. Ideally I’d like to back a project per month. Something I’m really interested in. Cream of the crop in my opinion and price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For May it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geekfevergames/avoid-the-void-a-board-game-of-chaos-and-survival&quot;&gt;Avoid the Void&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/04/pax-east-2016-avoid-the-void-by-geek-fever-games/&quot;&gt;game I covered&lt;/a&gt; from PAX East 2016. A really excellent game that’s not getting the funding it rightly deserves. Truthfully, I’ve seen a lot of crap get funded that has both asked for more, and raised even more than asked. Avoid the Void is a game that’s accessible, a good time, and a solid design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a day left in the campaign, and a bit over $5k left to raise to see the game funded. $25 will get you the retail game, which is a pretty great price considering how much board games can go for these days. Impulse buy for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon Launches November 18</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Company International and Nintendo have finally announced the release date of the latest Pokémon titles, Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon. On November 18th Pokémon fans will enter a new region, choosing from 3 new starter Pokémon: Grass and Flying-type Pokémon Rowlet, Fire-type Litten, and Water-type Popplio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Rowlet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rowlet&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Rowlet&lt;/strong&gt;
Category: Grass Quill Pokémon&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 1’00”&lt;br /&gt;
Weight: 3.3 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Grass/Flying&lt;br /&gt;
Starting Move: Leafage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of the potential partners is the highly adaptable Grass Quill Pokémon, Rowlet. This Pokémon can fly silently through the skies, sneaking up on its opponent without being noticed. It can attack its opponents using powerful kicks, and it can also attack from a distance using the razor-sharp leaves that form part of its feathers. Rowlet can survey its environment and turn its neck nearly 180 degrees from front to back, so it can see directly behind itself. When in battle, Rowlet turns its head to face its Trainer when waiting for instructions.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Litten.png&quot; alt=&quot;Litten&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Litten&lt;/strong&gt;
Category: Fire Cat Pokémon&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 1’04”&lt;br /&gt;
Weight: 9.5 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Fire&lt;br /&gt;
Starting Move: Ember&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool-headed Fire Cat Pokémon, Litten, is the next choice for a first-partner Pokémon. Litten’s fur is rich in oils and is immensely flammable. It constantly grooms itself by licking its coat, collecting loose fur into balls. It then ignites these hairballs to create fireball attacks. When the time comes for Litten to molt, it burns off all of its fur in one glorious blaze.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Popplio.png&quot; alt=&quot;Popplio&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: Popplio&lt;/strong&gt;
Category: Sea Lion Pokémon&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 1’04”&lt;br /&gt;
Weight: 16.5 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;
Type: Water&lt;br /&gt;
Starting Move: Water Gun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third possibility is the acrobatic Sea Lion Pokémon, Popplio. Popplio can create balloons made of water from its nose and utilize them to create a variety of different strategies and attacks in battle. This Pokémon is better at moving in the water than on land, and can swim at speeds over 25 mph. On land, it uses the elasticity of the balloons it creates to perform jumps and acrobatic stunts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokesun.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/images/pokemoon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pokémon Moon&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any new Pokémon, I’m super excited for these to come out. Of course it may come with the bitter disappointment of terrible Pokémon designs, but with any new Pokémon game there’s bound to be a handful of really cool ones. I can already say I’m not a fan of any of the three starters, or the new Legendaries, but I will hold out hope that there’s something amazing in the new batch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Mega Man</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mega Man is a game I’ve been waiting to get my hands on for a while now. I still haven’t had a chance to get it to the table yet, but I couldn’t resist tearing into it and seeing all the wonderful bits inside. I’ve got pictures from both the base game and the Time Man/Oil Man expansion, so there was a lot to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bestill my beating heart. These are some of the best pre-painted miniatures I’ve ever seen come with a game. I can only hope the game does well enough so we get Bass, and Treble. They had Dr. Light, Roll, and Protoman as Kickstarter add-ons, and unfortunately, I don’t have those…yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get into too much detail with the card decks between the two boxes as they’re pretty much the same, with only minor variation for the different boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really hoping the game turns out to be halfway descent, because it looks great. It’d be a shame to have all these cool bits for a game that doesn’t live up to the Mega Man name. Hopefully I’ll get a chance to play soon, and get my review up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bacterionomicon - The Creatures of the Healing Blade</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ct-fig.com&quot;&gt;Connecticut Festival of Indie Games&lt;/a&gt;, and while there’s a ton I’m going to be posting on &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; soon, there was an item there that didn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; fit in with the regular fair that I wanted to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mrsa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MRSA&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nerdcoremedical.myshopify.com/collections/books-and-comics/products/bacterionomicon2&quot;&gt;Bacterionomicon: The Creatures of the Healing Blade&lt;/a&gt; is a book of art based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://nerdcoremedical.com&quot;&gt;Nerdcore Medical&lt;/a&gt;’s upcoming card game, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healingblade.com&quot;&gt;Healing Blade&lt;/a&gt;. The book is one part hard medical science, one part RPG bestiary, and one part high-fantasy art book. Included inside are entries for 46 “Lords of Pestilence” from Acinetobacter baumannii to Yersinia pestis, and 30 “Apothecary Warriors” from Amoxicillin/Clavulanate to Vancomycin. Each entry contains a beautiful illustration, descriptive text, and information on how the Lords or Warriors fight, and their weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a copy of the book sitting next to me, and it’s amazing. The entire book from cover to cover is amazingly detailed, feels great in the hands, and is chock full of information. The ideas running through my head about how to uses these creatures and heroes are firing off like crazy. Adventure ideas for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dungeon-world.com&quot;&gt;Dungeon World&lt;/a&gt;, hero ideas for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nothankyouevil.com&quot;&gt;No Thank you, Evil!&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bacterionomicon is &lt;a href=&quot;https://nerdcoremedical.myshopify.com/collections/books-and-comics/products/bacterionomicon2&quot;&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt; for $46.99. I’d recommend it to any RPG buff, fantasy lover, or pathobiologist.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eternal Destiny - Animation Card Battle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Exploitive Anime: Animation Card Battle would have been a better name for this pile of rubbish. The original press release I got for this game promised “an epic card game inspired by myths, legends, and H.P. Lovecraft.” I don’t know what the hell they were talking about, because I’m not seeing much Lovecraft here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eternal Destiny was a free-to-play card game chock full of microtransactions originally launched on the PS Vita. The Steam version does away with the microtransactions in favor of a $9.99 price tag. Just because you take a shit game, remove the shitty fees from it, and put it up on Steam parading it as an actual, full-fledged game, doesn’t make it any less of a shit game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The card mechanics are pretty much the same we’ve seen in any tired, anime-inspired card battler. You can evolve cards to make more powerful cards that basically just smash against each other until enough damage makes its way through to the opponent and ends the match. All with a glossy coat of semi-NSFW anime art to keep the teens coming back for more. It’s pretty damn disgraceful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your $9.99 and self respect and stay clear of this one. Better yet. Take that $9.99 and put it towards some &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/429680/&quot;&gt;Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/410380/&quot;&gt;HEX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/en/int?r=hearthstone&quot;&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-duels&quot;&gt;Magic Duels&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/play-online/&quot;&gt;Pokemon&lt;/a&gt; cards. You’ll get a lot more play, and a lot more quality, with any of those titles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Coattails</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thomas Deeny (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DenaghDesign&quot;&gt;@DenaghDesign&lt;/a&gt;), another &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; Editor, wins the award for making me laugh so hard I almost fell out of my seat today. Thomas handles our Crowdfunding Highlights, and has started reporting on “Marketplace Confusion/Parody/Coattail Riding” games. Generally these are party games that are following in the footsteps of Cards Against Humanity. Usually these games are terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he added a new image to this section of the Crowdfunding Highlights, and I’m in love with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/PPCAH.png&quot; alt=&quot;CAH&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably laughed way more than I should have, but seriously, there are so many of these games hitting crowdfunding sites that it’s almost a joke in itself. This card is just the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Legend of Vyas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/04/second-looklegend-of-vyas/&quot;&gt;review of Legend of Vyas&lt;/a&gt;, by Vansh Games, went up today on Purple Pawn.  The game is a CCG based on the Indian epic, The Mahabharata. Along with it being a great game, the box and components are top notch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to future card releases, as we had a ton of fun with this.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Card Hunter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess I’ve been living under a rock, because I hadn’t heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cardhunter.com&quot;&gt;Card Hunter&lt;/a&gt; until I wrote up the release of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/04/penny-arcades-acquisitions-incorporated-comes-to-card-hunter/&quot;&gt;Penny Arcade Acquisitions Incorporated&lt;/a&gt; addon that was just released. Figuring I’d see what it’s about, I signed up for an account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Card Hunter is pretty much like playing D&amp;amp;D battles with a deck-building card mechanic. There’s a storyline where a Dungeon Master makes comments as you play through modules (old school art style and all) that pit you in battle against battle of monsters. There’s taverns to recruit more characters, and shops that sell new items. Every item you equip adds a certain amount of cards in your deck. Cards are used to move, cast spells, attack, etc… Everything is wrapped in a nice tabletop feel from the paper miniatures to the game board with assorted dice and things around the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Card Hunter is free to play, but (of course) there’s paid add-ons to expand the game, ones to give you better items when you complete a dungeon, and in-game currency (pizza) for premium items like custom minis and more. So far I’m enjoying the solo, free play. Eventually I’ll dig into the multiplayer, which I’m sure is a blast. Nothing like delving into dungeons with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Onitama</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wrote up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/04/second-lookonitama/&quot;&gt;review of Onitama&lt;/a&gt;, by Arcane Wonders, for Purple Pawn.  It’s an amazing little game with a ton of strategy, depth, and staying power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also beautiful, as you’re about to see.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecticut Festival of Indie Games</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2016/02/connecticut-festival-of-indie-games/&quot;&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; the start of a new convention in Connecticut, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ct-fig.com&quot;&gt;Connecticut Festival of Indie Games&lt;/a&gt;. The convention, hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ElmCityGames/&quot;&gt;Elm City Games&lt;/a&gt; in New Haven, is taking place on &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekandsundry.com/table-top-day/&quot;&gt;International Tabletop Day&lt;/a&gt; and will feature independent game designers from all over New England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will I be there covering the show for &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll be there as a judge as well. The “Figgies Awards” will be give out for Best 1st Impression, Best Artwork, Most Innovative, Most Sprit, and Best in Show. The winners receive some cool perks, as well as being able to use the Figgies Award badge on their game box, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s shaping up to be a great event, and I’m looking forward to playing all sorts of new game. If you’re going, don’t be afraid to hit me up for a game if you see me!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PAX East 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of year again! On Friday I’ll be heading to PAX East, this time for the full 3 days. I’ve already got a lot of appointments lined up with various game companies, and I’ll be wandering the tabletop area on the lookout for cool and exciting things. Of course, being there longer than I usually am, I’ll be looking to play more games!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to be at the show, gimme a shout on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rkalajian&quot;&gt;Twitter &lt;/a&gt; if you’re up for a game or have something new to show.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unboxing Dragoon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in March of last year I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/03/kickstarter-previewdragoon/&quot;&gt;preview of Dragoon&lt;/a&gt;, by Lay Waste Games, for Purple Pawn. Lay Waste had a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign, and a bit over a year later, I have the final product in my hands. The version I received is the Full Metal Mantis. This is the full color, full metal, version of the game available at the $75 pledge level of their campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eager to dig in, I decided to do an unboxing of the game in photo format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/dragoon/dragoon-box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dragoon Box&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/dragoon/dragoon-box-open.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dragoon Box Opened&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/dragoon/dragoon-cards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dragoon Cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is excellent, and I can’t recommend it enough. Lay Waste did an excellent job producing the game with all its excellent bits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forced Showdown</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to see several video games use the deck-building mechanic now. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2014/08/second-lookhand-of-fate/&quot;&gt;Hand of Fate&lt;/a&gt; was a fun distraction for a while, though it’s repetative nature got to me after a bit. Now I’ve gotten a review code for Forced Showdown, a twin-stick, rogue-like game with a deck-building mechanic to it. From what I’ve seen on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://forcedshowdown.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, it seems pretty cool. I’m hoping to get a chance to play it tonight and see for myself. If I do, I’ll make sure to stream it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitch.tv/rkalajian&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: I got a chance to play and stream! Check it out below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Pawn's Perspective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I’ve never really had a direction on this blog, or any of its previous incarnations. I’ve decided to change that, and start a focus to these posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you may know I write for &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;, a tabletop news website. I’ve been doing that now for over 6 years, and it’s something I’ve enjoyed immensely. I’ve branched out a bit, posting to my Instagram account, Periscope account, and even Twitch, in order to help reach a wider range of people. I’ve also been thinking of longer-form posts that may not always fit in the scope of Purple Pawn’s format. That’s what I intend to do here. That, and short snips that may be too short for Purple Pawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a new experiment, and one I hope pans out and that you all find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Office Aquarium</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I started a new job where I’m working in an office again. I’ve got a great cubicle, and the OK from my boss to put a small aquarium in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to go with a 3 gallon, planted shrimp tank, and have already begun the process of setting it up. I’ve got an &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/a/8ScPd&quot;&gt;Imgur&lt;/a&gt; gallery going with progress shots as the tank progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this post, my setup is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Tetra-29095-Cube-Aquarium-3-Gallon/dp/B008CA7W7E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1457490874&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tetra+3+gallon+cube&quot;&gt;Tetra 3 Gallon LED Cube&lt;/a&gt; (filter discarded)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/AZOO-AZ13097-Mignon-Filter-60/dp/B005VEWCMO&quot;&gt;AZOO Mignon Filter 60 filter&lt;/a&gt; (filter media discarded)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Aqua-Clear-A1370-Aquaclear-20-Gallon/dp/B0006JLO5K/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk&quot;&gt;Aquaclear 20-Gallon Biomax Bag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fluval-Plant-Shrimp-Stratum-4-4-Pound/dp/B00JGQIY48/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1460579376&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Fluval+Shrimp+Stratum&quot;&gt;Fluval Plant and Shrimp Stratum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GR0LKN8?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00&quot;&gt;HDE LCD Digital Fish Tank Aquarium Thermometer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/GEOsystem-11817-Mopani-Driftwood-Small/dp/B001URR3CA/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1457491033&amp;amp;sr=8-8&amp;amp;keywords=mopani+wood&quot;&gt;GEOsystem Mopani Driftwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 pieces of laval rock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Java ferns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Anubias&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LVRRROS?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00&quot;&gt;LUFFY Giant Marimo Moss Balls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m keeping an aquarium log with tank parameters, etc… using &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dyhwang.aquariumnote&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Aquarium Note&lt;/a&gt; for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end goal will be to get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aquaeden.co.uk/blue_velvet_shrimp.html&quot;&gt;Blue Velvet shrimp&lt;/a&gt; in the tank once it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.htm&quot;&gt;cycled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dragon Dice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sfr-inc.com/dragondice.php&quot;&gt;Dragon Dice&lt;/a&gt; has become something of a new obsession of mine. I recieved a Starter Set to review over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepawn.com/2015/09/second-lookdragon-dice-firewalkertreefolk-starter/&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve become quite smitten with the game. It has a long history, and is still kicking, but I figured I’d do my best to spread the word about it. Hopefully I can even get some demo time in at a few game stores around here in hopes that they’ll carry dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I’m just starting out, but I’ve found a bunch of great reference material online. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfr-inc.com/bb/index.php&quot;&gt;SFR Forums&lt;/a&gt; are an excellent place to start, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1860/dragon-dice&quot;&gt;Dragon Dice page on BGG&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/79660/unofficial-dragon-dice-reference-sheets&quot;&gt;excellent set of materials&lt;/a&gt; on the latter which are a huge help in getting started, as the main rulebook is pretty large with over 20 years of expansions and dice explinations packed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part? It’s fairly inexpensive to get into. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfr-inc.com/cart/index.php?cPath=21&amp;amp;osCsid=effd6a42017b05b99d0ac68f70bd5c51&quot;&gt;Starters&lt;/a&gt; are $33, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfr-inc.com/cart/index.php?cPath=22&amp;amp;osCsid=5ba02b2313d18c5d06fe47475db63f10&quot;&gt;Kickers&lt;/a&gt;, think booster packs, are around $10 each for 8 additional dice. You can also find tons of stuff on eBay, but the prices aren’t always the best unless you get lucky. You can also pick and choose your dice by heading straight to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chuckpint.com/frame.html&quot;&gt;Chunk Pint’s Dragon Dice page&lt;/a&gt; where he keeps of list of all the dice he as for sale, and what dice he currenlty needs and is willing to trade for. You can flesh out an army pretty inexpensivly there if you stick to more common dice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2014 Five and Dime List</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OK. I really meant to do this closer to the start of the year, but I kept forgetting. Below is my Five and Dime list for 2014. What’s a Five and Dime list? It’s a list of all games I played 5+ or 10+ times. I review a lot of games, so not a lot get repeat play. It’s always interesting to see what games actually got played this much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 or more plays&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic: The Gathering: 13 plays&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5 or more plays&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokémon Trading Card Game: 9 plays&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleminis: 8 plays&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golem Arcana: 6 plays&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knee Jerk: 5 plays&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsuro: 5 plays&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>High Roller</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, I really just need to start off my post with this image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/highroller.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;High Roller&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup. That’s me at Toy Fair riding an adult sized Big Wheel. The bike is make by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highrollerusa.com&quot;&gt;High Roller USA&lt;/a&gt; and is an absolute marvel. I actually got to tear down the isles of Toy Fair on this bad boy, and the awesome people at the booth even taught me how to power slide on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This this is built tough. The frame handled my bulk with no problem at all. The large front wheel is rubber making from some great traction, while the back wheels are plastic and made for drifting. Basically you turn the front wheel sharply and the back wheels just slide nice and smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do these puppies cost? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highrollerusa.com/cart&quot;&gt;$650&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a bit steep, but not really that outrageous when you consider how much other well made bikes cost. It’s also totally worth it to relive your youth and show all those toddler punks how it’s done on the mean streets of adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Am Elemental</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While at Toy Fair this year, the women over at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goldieblox.com&quot;&gt;Goldieblox&lt;/a&gt; booth had told me I just &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to go see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamelemental.com&quot;&gt;I Am Elemental&lt;/a&gt; booth. I’m really glad I did, because what they had to show off was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar, I Am Elemental makes a line of action figures for girls. Seeing an problem with the current selection of female action figures on the market, they came up with powerful superheroes with a more realistic body type. The women are also race-neutral, letting girls (hey, boys too!) to personify them as they wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://pawnsperspective.com/images/iamelemental.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Courage Line&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line of figures are based on courage, each heroine an element of courage. There’s Bravery, Energy, Persistance, Honesty, Industry, Enthusiasm, and Fear. It’s interesting to note that these aren’t women with superpowers, but the elements our courage personified. It’s also important to note that Fear isn’t the villain here. Courage cannot exist without fear, and the I Am Elemental team believe it’s important for children to know and embrace this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I recently ordered the full set of figures for my daughter’s 8th birthday at the end of the month. I can’t tell if we’re more excited to give them to her, or more excited that we’ll get to play with them too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly suggest giving them a look. I’ll post more here once my daughter has opened them and put them through their butt-kicking paces.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PAX East</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m off to PAX East to cover the show for &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplepawn.com&quot;&gt;Purple Pawn&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I’m there to cover tabletop games, I’ll be sure to post other interesting things I find here, with some pictures on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/r_kalajian/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; feed.&lt;/p&gt;
