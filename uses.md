    * [Logitech G915 TKL keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L8BP9KK/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_WDVRS47WTZXA40TMFV13)&#8212;I love, love, love the low profile switches on this mechanical keyboard. Turns out I should have bought the full keyboard because I do just enough numerical entry that it would be helpful.
    * [Logitech M705 Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z733CM/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_HCRMNWZ03T2QA8F45Z1T)&#8212;I've owned at least five of these mice over the years. They are lightweight and have an excellent battery life.
