### More Information

Graduate Students
I am actively seeking students who are in interested in phylogenetics, birds, and biogeography. If you are interested in getting a M.S. in Biology, please contact me directly at sreddy6{at}luc.edu and get more information about the graduate program at LUC.

Undergraduate Students
I am looking for motivated Biology and Bioinformatics students with an interest in evolutionary biology to join our lab team. Students need to have good communication (both oral and written) and organizational skills. 

Students working in my lab have to commit to at least 1.5 years and are expected to be in the lab 10-15 hours/week during the semester and if possible (funding is usually available) full-time during the summer. 

Here are the questions I generally ask students who are interested in working in my lab:
What are your future career goals and how will research on the evolution of birds help you attain these goals?
What interests you about birds and their evolution?
What are your goals and expectations about research in my lab?
How much time can you commit to working in the lab during the academic and summer months?
What previous experience do you have working in a lab or doing research?
Please name at least two Biology professors whose course you have taken and when.
