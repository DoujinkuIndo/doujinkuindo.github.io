My own research interests primarily lie in understanding why various kinds and numbers of species live in different environments. While this is seemingly simple question, the answer often tends towards complexity. The reason for this is that there are a significant number of processes that determine where species may persist, and who they may coexist with. These processes arise from the interaction between one or more axes of environmental heterogeneity, evolutionary trade-offs among organisms, and the density of different resources species may need in a given locality. Common trade-offs that species may exhibit within a habitat patch include differential resource use, abiotic tolerances, stress or disturbance tolerances, or sensitivity to predators. The fact that trade-offs occur is true across environments, from the most natural and far off reaches of planet Earth to my own back yard in Chicago. It is my goal to better understand these processes so that we may better conserve wildlife.

My pursuit of this goal can be broken down into two different areas.

### Urban ecology

In the last decade humanity has transitioned from primarily living in rural to urban areas, and in response urbanization rates have increased worldwide. And even though it is clear that urbanization profoundly alters the distribution and abundance of wildlife, there is still much to discover to better conserve biodiversity on an urbanizing planet. Through my research I seek to better understand how urban wildlife communities respond to urbanization across multiple spatial scales (e.g., both within and between cities). By doing so, we can improve our understanding of how urban wildlife populations and communities form and persist, how they interact with humans, and how they can better be conserved.

### Quantitative ecology

The models that ecologists develop, be they graphical, mathematical, or statistical, are abstractions of the truth and function as a means to extract useful information from data. Maps, for instance, are a model of the geographic features of a region, and good maps can be very useful. Ecologists are mapmakers of the natural world, and it is our job to simplify and approximate what we can so that we may better conserve and understand the species around us. Our ability to do this is, in part, conditional on the methodological tools at our disposal. I have a keen interest in developing techniques to get the most ecologically relevant information as possible from observational data, especially when data is collected imperfectly. By doing so, we can better answer both applied and basic questions in ecology.
