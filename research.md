We design __statistical models__ and __machine learning methods__ specialized for analyzing __neural data__.

## Neural Coding

How is information represented in the *noisy* spatio-temporal pattern of neural activity?

* Data-driven neural encoding model (visual, olfactory, auditory, tactile)
    * Generalized linear/quadratic model
* Population model of neural spike trains
    * Universal binary model
    * Latent process model

## Neural Computation and Dynamics

How does neural population compute?

* Perceptual decision making

## Machine learning and Signal Processing

* Stochastic variational inference for time series models
* Deep learning for spike patterns
* Kernel methods for spike trains
* Bayesian kernel adaptive filtering
* Brain machine interfaces
* Dimensionality reduction
* Non-parameteric Bayes
* Spectral method

## Statistics

* Hypothesis tests for spike trains
* Estimation of information theoretic quantities
* Scalable models for high-dimensional data
