### Urban ecology

In the last decade humanity has transitioned from primarily living in rural to urban areas, and in response urbanization rates increase worldwide. And even though it is clear that urbanization profoundly alters ecological processes and the distribution and abundance of wildlife, there is still much to discover to better conserve biodiversity on an urbanizing planet. For example, we currently know little regarding how ecological processes vary within and between cities across multiple scales. By describing and predicting similarities and differences among cities we can improve understanding of how urban wildlife populations and communities form and persist, how they interact with humans, and how they can better be conserved. Through my research, I seek to better understand whether urban wildlife communities respond to urbanization and...
