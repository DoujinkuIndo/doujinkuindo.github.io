My main evening project has been writing here at johnuhri.com. I have a few side projects I'm working on, but they get sporadic attention at best. The code I do write is much more fun as a hobby than my first responsibility at work.

Ski season is done for the year, at least for me. Now I'm looking forward to summer and getting the boat out on the water.
