My main evening project has been writing here at johnuhri.com. I have a few side projects I'm working on, but they get sporadic attention at best. The code I do write is much more fun as a hobby rather than my first responsibility at work.

Currently, I'm learning all of the 46 presidents in order. It's part of a goal to read a biography of each president.

Ski season is done for the year, at least for me. Now I'm looking forward to summer and getting the boat out on the water.
