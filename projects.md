Below you can find projects I have done that I have made usable enough for them to be demoable!

Persian Vocalizer
-----------------
This project takes text written in the Perso-Arabic script and tries to guess the vowels that are missing using an HMM trained on the Tajik dialect of Persian. Vocalized and pronounceable text to the user is then returned. It was created as part of a course I took on Language Engineering at KTH.
