title: Web Scraping - APIs
---


This is a follow up to my [first post](https://gerket.github.io/Web-Scraping-HTML/) about web scraping with HTML. Web scraping is the act of pulling information directly off of the internet. This is an important skill because we won't always have the data that we want in nice, clean databases or `.csv` files.

There are multiple ways of scraping data off of the internet. You could use an API (Application Program Interface - a tool made by the programmers of the website to help other programmers interact with their data or other aspects of the site) or you might just pull the HTML of the website. I'm going to give a rundown on how to do some HTML web scraping here.
