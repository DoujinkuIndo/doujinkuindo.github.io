    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To think of an idea for the game and what it would be about</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To think of a name for the game and give a clear description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I put a lot of detail and time in my work explaining the sprites the story behind the game what the objective is and lots more </td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I kept thinking of more ideas for my game even if I thought it already had too much detail and things(objectives,sprites,cars,weapons etc)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I did not question as me myself thought it was a rather simple task. I also finished my game idea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked alone on this game as I had a lot of creative ideas for the game. I did not ask my peer for any help or ideas </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I looked back at my work at home to see what i can improve or add using some of the ideas on the board to help me explain in more thorough detail</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged a lot in this activity and looked very keen to designing a game, due to this i was able to add a lot of information and detail to my game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I should have come up with a game that is not similar in ANY way to another game as mine was a bit similar to a game but not fully as i added a lot more objectives and things to do (going to mainland, trying to protect yourself from the animals that are very dangerous).</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think i could have asked my peer for his ideas as then i could think about what others enjoyed and particularly liked about games. This would give me more ideas on what people like about games.</td>
