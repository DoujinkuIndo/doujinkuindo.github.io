> " _This mind is the Buddha_ says the same thing. Beyond this mind you'll never find another Buddha. To search for enlightenment or nirvana beyond this mind is impossible. The reality of your own self-nature, the absence of cause and effect, is what's meant by mind. Your mind is nirvana. You might think you can find a Buddha or enlightenment somewhere beyond the mind, but such a place doesn't exist." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p9

> "Buddhas don't save Buddhas. If you use your mind to look for a Buddha, you won't see a Buddha. As long as you look for a Buddha somewhere else, you'll never see that your own mind is the Buddha." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p11

> "Don't use a Buddha to worship a Buddha. And don't use the mind to invoke a Buddha. Buddhas don't recite sutras. Buddhas don't keep precepts. And Buddhas don't break precepts. Buddhas don't keep or break anything. Buddhas don't do good or evil." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p11

> "Whoever sees his nature is a Buddha. If you don't see your nature, invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras, making offerings, and keeping precepts are all useless." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p13

> "If you don't see your nature and run around all day looking somewhere else, you'll never find a Buddha. The truth is, there's nothing to find." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p13

> "Whoever sees his nature is a Buddha; whoever doesn't is a mortal. But if you can find your Buddha-nature apart from your mortal nature, where is it? Our mortal nature is our Buddha-nature. Beyond this nature there's no Buddha. The Buddha is our nature. There's no Buddha besides this nature. And there's no nature besides the Buddha." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p16-17

> "If you attain anything at all, it's conditional, it's karmic. It results in retribution. It turns the Wheel. And as long as you're subject to birth and death, you'll never attain enlightenment. To attain enlightenment you have to see your nature. Unless you see your nature, all this talk about cause and effect is nonsense. Buddhas don't practice nonsense. A Buddha is free of karma, free of cause and effect. To say he attains anything at all is to slander  Buddha. What could he possibly attain?" - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p17

> "The ultimate Truth is beyond words. Doctrines are words. They're not the Way. The Way is wordless." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p31

> "If you see your nature, you don't need to read sutras or invoke Buddhas. Erudition and knowledge are not only useless but also cloud your awareness. Doctrines are only for pointing to the mind. Once you see your mind, why pay attention to doctrines?" - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p35

> "Once mortals see their nature, all attachments end. Awareness isn't hidden. But you can only find it right now. It's only now." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p35

> "Through endless kalpas without beginning, it's only because people don't see their nature that they end up in hell. As long as a person creates karma, he keeps passing through birth and death. But once a person realizes his original nature, he stops creating karma." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p41

> "The Buddha is your real body, your original mind. This mind has no form or characteristics, no cause or effect, no tendons or bones. It's like space. You can't hold it. It's not the mind or materialists or nihilists. Except for a Tathagata, no one else - no mortal, no deluded being - can fathom it.
> But this mind isn't somewhere outside the material body of four elements. Without this mind we can't move. The body has no awareness. Like a plant or stone, the body has no nature. So how does it move?  It's the mind that moves." - Bodhidharma, Bloodstream Sermon, [1], p43

> "Delusion means mortality. And awareness means buddhahood. They're not the same. And they're not different. It's just that people distinguish delusion and awareness. When we're deluded there's a world to escape. When we're aware, there's nothing to escape." - Bodhidharma, Wake-up Sermon, [1], p51

> "When you understand, reality depends on you. When you don't understand, you depend on reality. When reality depends on you, that which isn't real becomes real. When you depend on reality, that which is real becomes false. When you depend on reality, everything is false. When reality depends on you, everything is true. Thus, the sage doesn't use his mind to look for reality, or reality to look for his mind, or his mind to look for his mind, or reality to look for reality. His mind doesn't give rise to reality. And reality doesn't give rise to his mind. And because both his mind and reality are still, he's always in samadhi." - Bodhidharma, Wake-up Sermon [1], p57

> "There's no language that isn't the Dharma. To talk all day without saying anything is the Way. To be silent all day and still say something isn't the Way. Hence neither does a tathagatha's speech depend on silence, nor does his silence depend on speech, nor does his speech exist apart from his silence. Those hwo understand both speech and silence are in samadhi. If you speak when you know, your speech is free. If you're silent when you don't know, your silence is tied. If speech isn't attach to appearances, it's free. If silence is attached to appearances, it's tied. Language is essentially free. It has nothing to do with attachment. And attachment has nothing to do with language." - Bodhidharma, Wake-up Sermon [1], p65

> "_Without the mind there's no buddha_ means that the buddha comes from the mind. The mind gives birth to the buddha. But although the buddha comes from the mind, the mind doesn't come from the buddha, just as fish come from water, but water doesn't come from fish. Whoever wants to see a fish sees the water before he sees the fish. And whoever wants to see a buddha sees the mind before he sees the buddha.Once you've seen the fish, you forget about the water. And once you've seen the buddha, you forget about the mind. If you don't forget about the mind, the mind will confuse you, just as the water will confuse you if you don't forget about it." - Bodhidharma, Wake-up Sermon [1], p67
