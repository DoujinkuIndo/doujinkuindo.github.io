**Learning Objectives**:  
- Define what are koans
- Describe the different ways to practice with koans
- Provide some guidance to start

**Reading Material**:  
- [How to Practice Zen Koans](https://www.lionsroar.com/how-to-practice-zen-koans/) by John Tarrant

**Motivations** - This is an attempt to **introduce beginners** to the study of koans. I am a beginner myself (still and always), so I have tried to find my way through the literature, and with recommendations from a Zen [Roshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C5%8Dshi). Here are a few **excerpts and notes** that could help you start.

Note: this is still work in progress!

## What are koans?

> The literal meaning of the Chinese _kung-an_ (Japanese: _koan_) is "public notice" or "public announcement." Some words of a master or an episode from his life are presented to the disciple as an example for practice and attaining enlightenment. Although the core layer of the koan cases consists of brief reports from the master's life, directives and comments are added by the meditation leader who presents the koan for practice. Short poems revealing the enlightened understanding of the Elders were especially popular.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> Each piece [of the Hekiganroku] consists of a directive, a core case, comment on the case, an explanation of the case, a song forming a second highlight, comments on the song, and an explanation of it. [...] Each piece is a comprehensive and rather complex whole that can be mastered only with considerable effort.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> [The Mumonkan collection] is simple and less demanding than the Hekiganroku. Intended more for practical use, it has filled its purpose hundredfold. [Wu-men], the compiler of the forty-eight koans, [...] collected cases comprising the entire Zen tradition, from its Indian antecedents to the masters of the Lin-chi [Rinzai] and Ts'ao-tung [Soto] schools, and added succinct, critical remarks well suited to prod the nagging doubts of the practitioner. [...] Everything considered, the Mumonkan's koans are an excellent aid to progress along the way to enlightenment.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

## How to approach koans?

> [Composing a koan, in addition to the case, commentaries, capping verses, footnotes...] finally there is kyogai, the way in which a koan affects your consciousness - in other words, the effect it has on your life. This is ultimately where it counts. Because no matter how many hundreds of koans you pass through, if they do not change the way you relate to the rest of the world, then the are nothing but intellectual exercises. [...] Koan introspection is not about gaining information; it is about transforming your life.<sup>[3](#loori2005)</sup>

> Koans are not riddles or puzzles whose trick is in their clever and obscure wording. They are the clearest possible expression of perennial facts which students grasp with focused medication and guidance.<sup>[2](#aitken1990)</sup>

> [Koans support] an awakening to a profound experience of being by way of an encounter with concrete reality.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> Such themes are pursued with a keen, inquiring spirit, and the process of resolving them may take a long time, many years in some cases. Finally, the student gains a degree of understanding and is ready for subsequent koans to amplify, clarify and deepen the original insight.<sup>[2](#aitken1990)</sup>

> Seeing into a koan requires the embodiment of a certain state of consciousness rather than an abstraction of intellectual understanding. It is this direct "seeing into" that the teacher looks for and tests to determine the clarity of the student's understanding. And it is this direct understanding that is a the heart of realization - not the intellectualization of an idea.<sup>[3](#loori2005)</sup>


## Practicing with koans

> It is critical to differentiate between koan study and formal koan introspection in the context of a vital teacher-student relationship. Koan study tends to rely on the intellect. It aims to shed light on the basic Buddhist teachings communicated in the koan in a way similar to how a teacher will comment on a case in a teisho, or formal discourse, clarifying the koan's keu points. In koan introspection, on the other hand, a student sits with the koan in zazen, letting go of trying to solve or understand it, and works on the process of embodying it. The teacher then tests the student's direct insight into the koan in dokusan, private face-to-face interviews.<sup>[3](#loori2005)</sup>

> The approach to the koan varies with school and master. The content of the koan might, for example, be analyzed and its parts viewed separately, or else it might be grasped as a whole and appropriated to one's inner self.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> [One koan] was given to the disciple, who was to solve it by concentrating and devoting all [their] attention to it until - as the Zen saying goes - [their] bite gave way, meaning that [they] gave up rational thinking and made head-way into the suprarational realm of enlightenment.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> The practitioner, concentrating on the koan literally day and night, enters a hyperalert state in which he is aware of one thing only: the koan. This concentration gives rise to a search - at first for the solution of the koan. Utilizing all his intellectual powers, as he naturally would, the practitioner exerts himself with all his might, but to no avail. The illogical nature of the koan resits logical solution. He then enters into a state of helplessness and runs up against the same wall again and again, like someone locked in a small room. He searches for a way out, and yet the door is open - not where is intellect is aimed, however, for the wall does not give in. To see the opening, a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turnabout is necessary, in the direction of another, novel dimension.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> The koans themselves contain suggestions for summarizing their content in one clue word (Japanese: _jakugo_). This treatment is also popular among Zen masters. One condenses the entire koan into a word and then concentrates on it. He carries this word around with him and constantly turns it over in his mind. Zen literature compares this process to a ball of fire that one tosses about in his mouth, wanting to spit it out but unable to do so. The word might be continually repeated, murmured, or exclaimed vigorously.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

## Dos and Donts

work in progress

### Don't: conclude who's right or wrong

> [Commenting on a specific koan] Yuanwu continues by deriding practitioners who conclude that Yunyan's response must have been wrong, while Daowu's was right, explaining that these kinds of practitioners are people who get caught up in words and phrases and have not yet realized the truth. He then advises his students to cut off emotional defilements and conceptual thinking and to become naked, free, and unbounded, since this is the only way to understand the truth about Great Compassion.<sup>[3](#loori2005)</sup>

### Do: use multiple perspectives

Change of perspective
- What if you were each participant?
- What if each participant was you? (a part of you)
- What if you were all of them?

Change of time/sequence
- What if the story happened with long intervals in between? (ex: add a kalpa between a question and an answer)
- What if everything happened at once, in the same time? (ex: reducing all events to one instant)

Change of logic
- What if you hold all point of views in the same time?
- What if you took the opposite conclusion?
- What if you hold all views, opposite views, together?
- What if you denied all the views, hold no view at all?
