> The coin lost in the river is found in the river.

## Prompts

If that were beneficial, you can ask yourself systematically:
- What is lost?
- How is it lost?
- What is the river?
- How is it found?

# Readings

My own elaborations and prompts on this koan. Remember, the investigation **has to be your own** (see [introduction](../intro-to-koans)).

## Very literally: the coin

I drop a coin in the river, it is lost.  
Is it though? I __know__ where it is. It is in the river!  
Nothing is ever lost, everything is in the river.

I drop a coin in the river.  
Do I suffer from its loss or from my unwillingness to dive in?  
Instead of suffering for your lost coin, go find it, it's in the river!

The coin is not lost, it is only lost __to me__.  
The coin itself does not feel lost, it does not belong to me.  
Nothing is ever lost, only I am.  
Nothing is ever lost, only the object of my clinging, only my clinging is lost.

No thing belongs to me, every thing is found.  
If the world was _mine_, if I found the river, nothing would ever be lost.  
It is because I keep thinking in terms of mine / not mine that I keep loosing my coins in the river.

## My friend

_What is lost?_ - I lost my friend, my friend is lost.  
_How is it lost?_ - By passing away, by death, by dissolution of the body, by impermanence. She is lost for me, hidden, engulfed by the river.  
_What is the river?_ - It is the stream of life and death, causes and conditions, appearing and ceasing, it is Samsara.  
_How is it found?_ - I _know_ where she is, she is not lost, she is in the river. By joining the stream, she found home, a familiar river in which she was engulfed all along. _Anatta_, she is no more, she is, she never was, she was.

_What is lost?_ - My relationship with my friend, my attachment to her, my friendship.  
_How is it lost?_ - By losing its object in the river, by dissolution of its object, I __feel__ loss.  
_What is the river?_ - It is the stream of life and death, causes and conditions, appearing and ceasing, it is Indra's Net.  
_How is it found?_ - I _know_ where she is, she is in the same river I am in. She was no more that I was. She was no more than I am now.

## Duality

> Reversing the koan:  
> _The coin found in the river, is lost in the river._

Take a coin from the river and it is lost.  

Anything separated from the river loses its true nature.

As soon as I look for the coin, it is lost. Everywhere I look, I see loss.
