> ### The Case
>
> Whenever Chu-chih was aked a question, he simply raised one finder. One day a visitor asked Chu-chih's attendent what his master preached. The boy raised a finger. Hearing of this, Chu-chih cut off the boy's finger with a knife. As he ran from the room, screaming with pain, Chu-chih called to him. When he turned his head, Chu-chih raised a finger. The boy was suddenly enlightened.  
> When Chu-chih was about to die, he said to his assembled monks: "I received this one-finger Zen from T'ien-long. I used it all my life but never used it up." With this he entered into his eternal rest.
> 
> ### Wu-men's comment
> The enlightenment of Chu-chih and the boy has nothing to do with the end of a finger. If you can realize this, then T'ien-lung, Chu-chih, the boy, and you yourself are all run through with a single skewer.
> 
> ### Wu-men's verse
> T'ien-lung made a fool of old Chu-chih  
> who cut the boy with a sharp blade,  
> just as the deity Chu-ling raised his hand,  
> and Hua-shan, with its many ridges, split into two.

## Notes

Book of Serenity Case 84 has some comments/notes/interjections following the case. Here's some:
- _"... he would just raise one finger"_ -- Why expend so much energy?
