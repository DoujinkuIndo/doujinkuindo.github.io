Translation: [Robert Aitken, The Gateless Barrier, 1990](https://www.google.com/search?q=robert+aitken+gateless+barrier).

> ### The Case
>
> Whenever Chu-chih was aked a question, he simply raised one finder. One day a visitor asked Chu-chih's attendent what his master preached. The boy raised a finger. Hearing of this, Chu-chih cut off the boy's finger with a knife. As he ran from the room, screaming with pain, Chu-chih called to him. When he turned his head, Chu-chih raised a finger. The boy was suddenly enlightened.  
> When Chu-chih was about to die, he said to his assembled monks: "I received this one-finger Zen from T'ien-long. I used it all my life but never used it up." With this he entered into his eternal rest.
> 
> ### Wu-men's comment
> The enlightenment of Chu-chih and the boy has nothing to do with the end of a finger. If you can realize this, then T'ien-lung, Chu-chih, the boy, and you yourself are all run through with a single skewer.
> 
> ### Wu-men's verse
> T'ien-lung made a fool of old Chu-chih  
> who cut the boy with a sharp blade,  
> just as the deity Chu-ling raised his hand,  
> and Hua-shan, with its many ridges, split into two.

## Notes

Case 3 of Gateless Barrier is also:
- Case 84 of Book of Serenity, "Judi's 'One Finger'"
- Case 245 of Dogen's Shinji Shobogenzo, "Juzhi Holds Up One Finger"

Book of Serenity Case 84 has some comments/notes/interjections following the case. Here's some:
- _"... he would just raise one finger"_ -- Why expend so much energy?

> Dogen's Shinji Shobogenzo, Case 245, commentary:  
> _"The truth of \[Chu-chih\]'s teachings is not to be found in the finger. This being the case, you tell me, if the truth is not in the finger, then where is it?"_

> Book of Serenity, Case 84, commentary:
> _"Xuansha said, 'If I had seen \[Chu-chih\] at the time, I would have broken off his finger.' \[...\] Xuanjiai said, 'Tell me, what did Xuansha mean in speaking that way?' I say, after all he doubts. Yunju Yi said, 'When Xuansha spoke that way, was he agreeing with \[Chu-chih\] or not? If he agreed, why did he say he'd break off his finger? If not, where was \[Chu-chih\]'s fault?' I say, the fault lies in agreeing and disagreeing."_

## The one finger

> Whenever Chu-chih was aked a question, he simply raised one finder.

The one finger.

> One day a visitor asked Chu-chih's attendent what his master preached. The boy raised a finger.

Not the same finger.

> Hearing of this, Chu-chih cut off the boy's finger with a knife.

Not the same finger.

> As he ran from the room, screaming with pain, Chu-chih called to him. When he turned his head, Chu-chih raised a finger.

The one finger.

> When Chu-chih was about to die, he said to his assembled monks: "I received this one-finger Zen from T'ien-long. I used it all my life but never used it up."

How could you use it up when there's only one finger?

## One

One finger, one world.

One finger, one practice.

One finger, one realization.

One finger, one one.
