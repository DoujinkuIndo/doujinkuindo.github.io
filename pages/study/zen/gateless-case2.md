# Case \#2: Paichang's Fox

Traduction: [Robert Aitken, The Gateless Barrier, 1990](https://www.google.com/search?q=robert+aitken+gateless+barrier).

> ### The Case
>
> Once when Paichang gave a series of talks, a certain old man was always there listening together with the monks. When they left, he would leave too. One day, however, he remained behind. Paichang asked him, "Who are you, standing here before me?"
>
> The old man replied, "I am not a human being. In the far distant past, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain. One day a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, 'Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.' With this I was reborn five hundred times as a fox. Please say a turning word for me and release me from the body of a fox."
>
> He then asked Paichang, "Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?"
>
> Paichang said, "Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect."
>
> Hearing this, the old man immediately was enlightened. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is on the other side of this mountain. I wish to make a request of you. Please, Abbot, perform my funerals as for a priest."
>
> Paichang had a head monk strike the signal board and inform the assembly that after the noon meal there would be a funeral service for a priest. The onks talked about this in wonder. "All of us are well. There is no one in the morgue. What does the teacher mean?"
>
> After the meal, Paichang led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then performed the ceremony of cremation. That evening he took the high seat before his assembly and told the monks the whole story.
>
> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given the right answer each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"
>
> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and slapped him in the face.
>
> Paichang clapped his hands and laughed, saying, "I thought the Barbarian had a red beard, but here is a red-bearded Barbarian."
>
> ### Wu-men's comment
> "Not falling under the law of cause and effect." Why should this prompt five hundred lives as a fox? "Not evading the law of cause and effect." Why should this prompt a return a human life? If you have the single eye of realization, you will appreciate how old Paichang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace.
>
> ### Wu-men's verse
> Not falling, not evading--  
> two faces of the same die.  
> Not evading, not falling--  
> a thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes.

## A read about being wrong all the time

> Paichang asked him, "__Who are you__, standing here before me?"  

(Don't reply!)

> The old man __replied__ [...]

(Oh no, you did!)

Old Paichang's very act of replying indicates he is indeed the object of the law of cause and effect. Does old Paichang still thinks of himself as a self?

> One day __a monk asked me__, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I __replied__, 'Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.'

A wrong question leads to a wrong answer.

It's not because someone asks you a question that you have to answer.

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"

That's a trap!

> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and slapped him in the face.

It seems better to just not answer anything at all.

> After the meal, Paichang led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then performed the ceremony of cremation.

A ceremony is maybe the best answer to the question asked to both Paichangs. Ritual and art, is that the answer?

## A read about doctrines

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is __on the other side of this mountain__.

I bet the other side of __this__ mountain is facing north.

> After the meal, Paichang led the monks to the foot of a rock __on the far side of the mountain__. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then __performed the ceremony of cremation__.

Old Paichang does not belong to the same side of the mountain, still he deserves to receive cremation owed to a priest.

> "In the far distant past, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain. One day a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, '__Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.__' With this I was __reborn five hundred times__ as a fox. Please say a turning word for me and release me from the body of a fox."
>
> He then asked Paichang, "Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?"
>
> Paichang said, "__Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect.__"
>
> Hearing this, the old man __immediately was enlightened__. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox."

It sounds quite ironic that, old Paichang has the view of gradual enlightenment, and because of that, is reborn five hundred times as a fox. The irony is that he had to be reborn that many times to one day become enlightened... after hearing the view of sudden enlightenment. That must be a karmic joke.

The view of gradual enlightenment __is__ wrong, but it __became__ true so that old Paichang could realize his error. That's how I would say I _"appreciate how old Paichang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace."_

There is a contradiction in the view of old Paichang. The law of cause and effect is what sustains the view of gradual enlightenment. But this view nullifies the law of cause and effect after enlightenment, when the ultimate fruit comes. How could the law be considered true at some point, and nullified at another.

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"
>
> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and __slapped him in the face__.

Sounds like we want Paichang to be true when he says _"such a person does not evade"_ karmic law. But it seems that he is as wrong as Old Paichang. Sudden enlightenment is not more true, as a view, than gradual. Because of that, Paichang gets a slap in the face.

If I can become pragamatic for a second, I'd rather get slapped in the face than be reborn five hundred times as a fox. So sudden enlightenment is maybe less wrong than gradual enlightenment. Still, Huang-po's slap suggest __none of those answers are actually true__.

Gradual = Sudden + Karma ?  
Gradual is actually Sudden, with the Self believing there was a gradual process at play.  
Sudden says the law cannot be obscured, evaded, which brings us back to wonder when we'll exit it, back to Gradual.

## A read about turning

> "Not falling under the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox? "Not evading the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt a return a human life? If you have the single eye of realization, you will appreciate how old Paichang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace.

What has old Paichang done to receive this fruit and live five hundred lives as a fox? What has he done to be released from it today? Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox?

> Once when Paichang gave a series of talks, a certain old man was always there listening together with the monks. When they left, he would leave too. __One day__, however, __he remained behind.__

What happened that day? What came to be? What was different about that day? What emerged so that, __this__ particular day, old Paichang went to the master?

> "Please say a __turning point__ for me [...] Hearing this, the old man __immediately was enlightened__."

Actually, nothing changed.

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox."

No you're not. Like an addendum [BoS case 123] puts it: _"fox drool is still there"_.

Before and after the turning point are the same. Old Paichang was enlightened but there was __no evasion__, __because__ an enlightened person _"does **not** evade the law of cause and effect"_.

But still, __something__ must have turned, but __what__ ? __What__ could be _"released from the body of the fox"_ ?

## A read about the ritual

> Hearing this, the old man immediately was enlightened. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is on the other side of this mountain. I wish to make a request of you. __Please__, Abbot, __perform my funerals as for a priest__."

The ritual is requested by old Pichang, __because__ he understands that an enlightened person __does not evade__ the law of cause and effect. There is still work to be done, and a law to obey.

> "There, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then performed __the ceremony of cremation__."

There are two truths that co-exist: _karma_ and _anatta_. On one side, _karma_ and its cage of responsibility for our past actions. On the other, _anatta_ and the release of _karma_ because its basis is non-existent. One can navigate their way by playing on those two truths, one day feeling free from non-self, one day brought back to responsibility. But one should not play with these two truths, use them when they are convenient. One should respect both, acknowledge them both.

Is the ritual of cremation the way to respect both truths? Is it the function, the end of Zen practice and liturgy to pay respect to both truths?
