> ### The Case
>
> Once when Paichang gave a series of talks, a certain old man was always there listening together with the monks. When they left, he would leave too. One day, however, he remained behind. Paichang asked him, "Who are you, standing here before me?"
>
> The old man replied, "I am not a human being. In the far distant past, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain. One day a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, 'Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.' With this I was reborn five hundred times as a fox. Please say a turning word for me and release me from the body of a fox."
>
> He then asked Paichang, "Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?"
>
> Paichang said, "Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect."
>
> Hearing this, the old man immediately was enlightened. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is on the other side of this mountain. I wish to make a request of you. Please, Abbot, perform my funerals as for a priest."
>
> Paichang had a head monk strike the signal board and inform the assembly that after the noon meal there would be a funeral service for a priest. The onks talked about this in wonder. "All of us are well. There is no one in the morgue. What does the teacher mean?"
>
> After the meal, Paichang led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then performed the ceremony of cremation. That evening he took the high seat before his assembly and told the monks the whole story.
>
> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given the right answer each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"
>
> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and slapped him in the face.
>
> Paichang clapped his hands and laughed, saying, "I thought the Barbarian had a red beard, but here is a red-bearded Barbarian."
>
> ### Wu-men's comment
> "Not falling under the law of cause and effect." Why should this prompt five hundred lives as a fox? "Not evading the law of cause and effect." Why should this prompt a return a human life? If you have the single eye of realization, you will appreciate how old Paichang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace.
>
> ### Wu-men's verse
> Not falling, not evading--  
> two faces of the same die.  
> Not evading, not falling--  
> a thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes.

## Notes

Case 2 of Gateless Barrier is also:
- Case 8 of Book of Serenity,
- Case 102 of Dogen's Shinji Shobogenzo.

_"Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect"_ is elsewhere rendered as:
- _"The law of cause and effect cannot be obscured."_ (Koun Yamada Roshi, The Gateless Gate, 19XX)
- _"He is not blind to cause and effect."_ (Thomas Cleary, Book of Serenity, Case 8, 2005)
- _"Don't ignore cause and effect"_ (Kazuaki Tanahashi, John Daido Loori, The True Dharma Eye case 102, 2005)

Book of Serenity Case 8 has some comments/notes/interjections following the case. Here's two:
- _"The old man was enlightened at these words - Fox drool is still there."_
- _"For five hundred lives he couldn't do a thing - If he had known what would happen today, he'd regret not being careful to begin with."_

# Readings

When I read cases, I tend to take notes: some thoughts that are prompted by reading the text, or coming later remembering the text, or even just unprompted but related.  
In the following, I arranged my notes in "reads": I related the notes to the aspect of the text that prompted them, and organized them in topics.

These notes offer an account of my way to "process" this case, in order to support others' own processes. Indeed, I tried to keep **only the investigative side** of my notes, getting rid of my own thoughts to keep only the prompts, the nudges, the questions. I offer those hoping they can be **useful prompts for your own investigation**.

Remember, the investigation **has to be your own** (see [introduction](../intro-to-koans)).

## A read about being wrong all the time

> One day, however, he remained behind. Paichang __asked him__,

Hu ho...

> "__Who are you__, standing here before me?"  

Don't reply!

> The old man __replied__...

Oh no, you did!

> __I__ am not a human being...

Starting with "I", not a great start for an answer.

What does this reply indicate? The old man indeed seems to be the object of the law of cause and effect.

Would he answer __this__ question if he was enlightened?

> One day __a monk asked me__, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' ...

Hu ho... don't tell me you replied to that one too?

> ... __I replied__ ...

Oh no, you did it again!

Someone asking you a question does not mean you have to answer.

> 'Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.'

A wrong question leads to a wrong answer.

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"

That's a trap!

> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and slapped him in the face.

It seems better to just not answer anything at all.


## A read about the ritual

Ritual and liturgy, is that the answer to the question?

> Hearing this, the old man immediately was enlightened. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is on the other side of this mountain. I wish to make a request of you. __Please__, Abbot, __perform my funerals as for a priest__."

Why does old Paichang request a funeral?

Is the ritual requested by old Paichang, __because__ he understands that an enlightened person __does not evade__ the law of cause and effect? Old Paichang is enlightened, but there are still things that need to happen, and a law that cannot be obscured.

> "There, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then performed __the ceremony of cremation__."

Why would there be anything to do with the fox's body? What does it __do__? What does it changes?

There are two truths that co-exist while being orthogonal to one another: _karma_ and _anatta_. On one side, _karma_ and its cage of responsibility for our past actions. On the other, _anatta_ and the release of _karma_ because its basis is non-existent. One can navigate their way by playing on those two truths, one day feeling free from non-self, one day brought back to responsibility. But one should not play with these two truths, one should not use them when they are convenient. One should respect both, acknowledge them both.

Is the ritual of cremation the way to respect both truths? Is it the function, the end of Zen practice and liturgy to pay respect to both truths?

## A read about doctrines

_Note: it is useful to have read the Sutra of Hui-neng for this read, and to know the distinction between the schools of Hui-neng and Shen-hsiu._

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is __on the other side of this mountain__.

I bet the other side of __this__ mountain is facing north.

> After the meal, Paichang led the monks to the foot of a rock __on the far side of the mountain__. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then __performed the ceremony of cremation__.

Old Paichang does not belong to the same side of the mountain, still he deserves to receive the ritual owed to a priest.

> "In the far distant past, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain. One day a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, '__Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.__' With this I was __reborn five hundred times__ as a fox. Please say a turning word for me and release me from the body of a fox."
>
> He then asked Paichang, "Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?"
>
> Paichang said, "__Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect.__"
>
> Hearing this, the old man __immediately was enlightened__. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox."

It sounds quite ironic that, old Paichang has the view of gradual enlightenment, and (seemingly) __because of that__, he is reborn five hundred times as a fox. The irony is that he had to be reborn that many times to one day become enlightened... after hearing the view of sudden enlightenment. The view of gradual enlightenment __became right__ so that old Paichang could realize it is __wrong__. That must be a karmic joke.

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"
>
> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and __slapped him in the face__.

We want Paichang to be true when he says _"such a person does not evade"_ karmic law. That should be the good answer to the question, according to this account, right? But he seems as wrong as Old Paichang. Because of that, Paichang gets a slap in the face.

Sudden enlightenment is not more true, as a view, than gradual. If I am pragmatic for a second, I'd rather get slapped in the face than be reborn five hundred times as a fox. So sudden enlightenment is maybe "less wrong" than gradual enlightenment. Still, Huang-po's slap suggests that __none of those answers are actually right__.

Gradual.E = Sudden.E + Karma ?  
Gradual.E is actually Sudden.E, with the Self believing there was a gradual process at play. You get enlightened suddenly, but your view makes you think you had to wait such a long time for it to happen.  
Sudden.E says the law cannot be obscured, evaded, which brings us back to wonder when we'll exit it, back to Gradual.E.

(Dogen would probably point out that it's an answer made of words, or that it's one view distinct from others, so it's a wrong view. He says _"If you fall into the words and ideas [...] you too will be a fox spirit"_, in comments of case 102)

_Karma_ is the law of cause and effect, and it also is the phenomena it governs. The law and the objects of the law are "one". A single cause/effect relationship is "one with" the continuum.  
Like an instant in a duration.  
Like a wave in the ocean.  
There is no "way out" of karmic law, because there's no "in". You can't obscure it.

## A read about cause and effects

> Once when Paichang gave a series of talks, a certain old man was always there listening together with the monks. When they left, he would leave too. __One day__, however, __he remained behind.__

What happened that day? What came to be? What was different about that day? What emerged so that __this__ day old Paichang went to the master?

> __When they left, he would leave too__.

He was going with the stream.

> __One day, however__, he remained behind.

There the stream meets a boulder, causing the water to stop for a moment.

> "Not falling under the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox? "Not evading the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt a return a human life? If you have the single eye of realization, you will appreciate how old Paichang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace.

What has old Paichang done to receive this fruit and live five hundred lives as a fox? What has he done to be released from it today? Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox?

> The old man replied, "I am not a human being. __In the far distant past__, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, __I was___ head priest at this mountain.

The "I" changes every day. Every instant there's a new "I" emerging and an old "I" ceasing. It is the radical impermanence of the Self, dispersed in Indra's Net.  
_"In the far distant past ... __I was__ ..."_ - this is so far in the past, how could there be anything left from the "I" that __was__.  
It has already been dispersed, ceased, renewed, every instant between then and now. A radical change for every instant, not just for a second but for centuries.  
There's nothing left really. So what is the "I" that old Paichang now claims he __was__ back then? If there's nothing left from it, __who__ was reborn five hundred times?

> "Please say a __turning point__ for me [...] Hearing this, the old man __immediately was enlightened__."

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox."

No you're not. _"Fox drool is still there."_

Before and after the turning point are the same. Old Paichang was enlightened but there was __no evasion__, precisely __because__ an enlightened person _"does **not** evade the law of cause and effect"_.

But still, __something__ must have turned, but __what__ ? __What__ could be _"released from the body of the fox"_ ?

# Dogen's slap

At this point in my exploration, I read Dogen's commentary on this case. This is the chapter of the Shobogenzo titles "On the Great Practice" (_Daishugyo_) \[[pdf](https://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/073daishugyo.pdf)\].

Here's a couple of excerpts I took right in the face:

> If being reduced to the state of a wild fox was the inevitable consequence of answering a trainee’s question inaccurately, then how many thousands of myriad times would the Rinzais and Tokusans of more recent times, along with their disciples, have been reduced to being wild foxes as a consequence? And apart from them, senior monks who have made mistakes over the past two or three hundred years would certainly have become innumerable foxes.

> If you were to say, “When someone who was a bystander spoke a triggering phrase concerning causality, that freed another from the mind of a wild fox,” well, the great earth with its mountains and rivers has already been giving forth innumerable triggering expressions concerning causality and is continually doing so. But even so, the old man had not yet dropped off the mind of a wild fox in the past, and he only dropped it off due to the later Abbot’s triggering words concerning causality.

## Unsorted notes

Enlightenment itself is impermanent?

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given the right answer __each time__ he was asked a question -- __what would have happened then__?"

How many times does one have to answer that question?  
The answer is not the issue here, the answer did not cause old Paichang to be reborn five hundred times as a fox. There is no relationship between that cause and that effect.

## Composing an answer?

After spending a couple of months practicing with this koan, I was suggested to focus on the question. I started composing answers trying to capture all those glimpses of understanding I had. Still not satisfied with any of those, probably never will be.

\- Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?  
\- Watch your steps if you don't want to fall.

\- Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?  
\- _Unshakable is the liberation of my mind. This is my last birth. Now there is no more renewed existence._ \[[SN 56.11](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/bodhi)\]

\- Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?  
\- When the ox walks into the mud, the mud sticks to his feet.

\- Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?  
\- The gravel hits the bamboo, the gravel hits the floor, two hits, one sound.

\- Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?  
\- A waterfall is just a river cut in half.
