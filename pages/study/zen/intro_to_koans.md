# WORK IN PROGRESS

## What are koans?

> The literal meaning of the Chinese _kung-an_ (Japanese: _koan_) is "public notice" or "public announcement." Some words of a master or an episode from his life are presented to the disciple as an example for practice and attaining enlightenment. Although the code layer of the koan cases consists of brief reports from the master's life, directives and comments are added by the meditation leader who presents the koan for practice. Short poems revealing the enligntened understanding of the Elders were especially popular.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> Each piece [of the Hekiganroku] consists of a directive, a core case, comment on the case, an explanation of the case, a song forming a second highlight, comments on the song, and an explanation of it. [...] Each piece is a comprehensive and rather complex whole that can be mastered only with considerable effort.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> [The Mumonkan collection] is simple and less demanding than the Hekiganroku. Intended more for practical use, it has filled its purpose hundredfold. [Wu-men], the compiler of the forty-eight koans, [...] collected cases comprising the entire Zen tradition, from its Indian antecedents to the masters of the Lin-chi [Rinzai] and Ts'ao-tung [Soto] schools, and added succinct, critical remarks well suited to prod the nagging doubts of the practitioner. [...] Everything considered, the Mumonkan's koans are an excellent aid to progress along the way to enlightenment.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

## How to approach koans?

> Koans are not riddles or puzzles whose trick is in their clever and obscure wording. They are the clearest possible expression of perennial facts which students grasp with focused medication and guidance.<sup>[2](#aitken1990)</sup>

> [Koans support] an awakening to a profound experience of being by way of an encounter with concrete reality.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> Such themes are pursued with a keen, inquiring spirit, and the process of resolving them may take a long time, many years in som cases. Finally, the student gains a degree of understanding and is ready for subsequent koans to amplify, clarify and deepen the original insight.<sup>[2](#aitken1990)</sup>

## Practicing with koans

> The approach to the koan varies with school and master. The content of the koan might, for example, be analyzed and its parts viewed separately, or else it might be grasped as a whole and appropriated to one's inner self.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> [One koan] was given to the disciple, who was to solve it by concentrating and devoting all [their] attention to it until - as the Zen saying goes - [their] bite gave way, meaning that [they] gave up rational thinking and made head-way into the suprarational realm of enlightenment.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> The practitioner, concentrating on the koan literally day and night, enters a hyperalert state in which he is aware of one thing only: the koan. This concentration gives rise to a search - at first for the solution of the koan. Utilizing all his intellectual powers, as he naturally would, the practitioner exerts himself with all his might, but to no avail. The illogical nature of the koan resits logical solution. He then enters into a state of helplessness and runs up against the same wall again and again, like someone locked in a small room. He searches for a way out, and yet the door is open - not where is intellect is aimed, however, for the wall does not give in. To see the opening, a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turnabout is necessary, in the direction of another, novel dimension.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

> The koans themselves contain suggestions for summarizing their content in one clue word (Japanese: _jakugo_). This treatment is also popular among Zen masters. One condenses the entire koan into a word and then concentrates on it. He carries this word around with him and constantly turns it over in his mind. Zen literature compares this process to a ball of fire that one tosses about in his mouth, wanting to spit it out but unable to do so. The word might be continually repeated, murmured, or exclaimed vigorously.<sup>[1](#dumoulin1979)</sup>

## Dos and Donts

### Perspectives

Change of perspective
- What if you were each participant?
- What if each participant was you? (a part of you)
- What if you were all of them?

Change of time/sequence
- What if the story happened with long intervals in between? (ex: add a kalpa between a question and an answer)
- What if everything happened at once, in the same time? (ex: reducing all events to one instant)

Change of logic
- What if you hold all point of views in the same time?
- What if you took the opposite conclusion?
- What if you hold all views, opposite views, together?
- What if you denied all the views, hold no view at all?
