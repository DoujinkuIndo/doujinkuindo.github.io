_[work in progress]_

**Learning Objectives**:  
- Explore resources to discover Buddhism
- Provide guidance on creating one's journey into Buddhism

**Motivations** - Discovering Buddhism is an individual journey. No two Buddhists have gone through the same. That's because Buddhism is a diverse and complex and still active domain of thought. As I was once a beginner myself, I tend to let people discover Buddhism on their own, not wanting to interfere with their journey. For that, this page proposed a couple of starting links to initiate that journey.  
Now, that being said, there are a couple of mistakes and wrong expectations that could be helpful to debug so you start without too many illusions or pre-conceptions or projections. This page will provide a couple of things to be aware of when you start your journey, and traps to avoid.

## What to be aware of

**True Buddhism is an illusion** - Every Buddhist school, tradition, movement, is deeply rooted in a specific historical context, in a specific culture. From the Tantric Tibetan Buddhism to the Secular Buddhists, all traditions old and new derive from multiple origins, have gone through many transformations, and influence one another all the time. Yet, many schools claim to be expressing "Original Buddhism" or "True Buddhism". This is an illusion. All Buddhism is cultural, and based on roots that are impermanent and interdependent. Being aware of those roots is important to analyze the teachings expressed by each of those schools, and put them in perspective from one another, while avoiding claiming to hold the one true Dharma. Whenever you read an introduction to Buddhism, hear a given Dharma talk, try to be aware of who's talking and what in what context they are.

**Wrong Buddhism is very real** - Although Buddhism is often viewed as a philosophy of life that inspires only peace and morality, in reality, like any other social group, Buddhism can harbor mental toxicity, indoctrination, manipulation, violence. Denying this is just another case of [buddhist exceptionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Thompson).  
No specific school is exempt from abuse of power, harrassment, coercion. If you join a Buddhist group, please don't ignore this and be aware of the power dynamic in the group. Try to gauge if it has a healthy way of dealing with internal issues.

**Contradicting teachings** - The intellectual architecture of the Buddha Dharma is complex. And many concepts that are used through the scriptures are conflicting with one another (ex: karma and impermanence). Those contradictions exist for a reason and should be embraced as is (not gonna expand on that for now). Also, they are actually a good sign, they indicate authenticity. Finally, they ensure diversity: a healthy community supported by those scriptures cannot be restricted to one single totalitarian view of what the Dharma is. The Dharma is a field of discovery, meditation, contemplation, study and debate. Don't try too hard to find a pure and diamond-like theory or philosophy.

## Things to avoid

**Fundamentalism** - Like all other religious scriptures, Buddhist scriptures have gone through transformations. They have been first written down after 500 years of having been only remembered and recited as part of a long oral tradition. Then, they have been compiled, translated, edited, filtered, re-compiled, commented, etc. They have also been the subject of creative work: centuries after the passing of the Buddha, some unknown authors created brand new Sutras as inspired by their faith and practice, and presented them as if they had been spoken at the time of the Buddha. Those sometimes introduced brand new concepts, or had a different emphasis than previous scriptures. Those new Sutras, with time, translation and propagation, became new canons, revered and recited by many Buddhist schools today. In short: no scripture or "canon" can pretend to be the one original permanently untouched scripture that should be taken literally as the Buddha's pure teachings. That being said, deviating from the Scriptures or becoming creative about them should always be done carefully and transparently.
