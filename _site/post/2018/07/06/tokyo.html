    <p>Tokyo is often referred to as a city, but is officially known and governed as a “metropolitan prefecture”.</p>

<p>This differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo.
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the 23 Special Wards of Tokyo (each governed as an individual city), which 
cover the area that was the city of Tokyo before it merged and became the metropolitan prefecture in 1943, 
the 30 municipalities in the western part of the prefecture, and the two outlying island chains.</p>
