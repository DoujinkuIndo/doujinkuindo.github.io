A Pawn's Perspective isn't my full-time gig. Not even close! It's a labor of love, something I enjoy that differs from my day-to-day work. That being said, it still incurs some cost. Hosting, equipment, convention converage, purchases of hard-to-get review items, etc... That's why I've setup a [Patreon page](https://goo.gl/RYhDSh). If you enjoy reading A Pawn's Perspective, and would like to help out, even just a little bit, think about becoming a Patron!

These awesome people have:
