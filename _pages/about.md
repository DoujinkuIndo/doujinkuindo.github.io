I am a final year Undergraduate student at the NIIT University, Computer Science Department. My research experience lies in designing and developing algorithms to apply machine learning, specifically self organizing maps. Other experiences include classification of Himalayan hyperspectral imagery and designing channel assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks. Being an undergraduate researcher allowed me to experience a few different domains. 

Currently, I am a North Yard Analytics Fellow, a soccer analytics enthusiast and have posted several articles on Medium regarding the same. I am highly interested in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Soccer Analytics and look forward to continue to solve real world problems in those domains.
