I am a final year Undergraduate student at **NIIT University, Computer Science Department**. My research experience lies in designing and developing algorithms to apply machine learning, specifically self organizing maps. My technical skills include **Python, R, Javascript, C++**. I enjoy solving problems on Kaggle/Analytics Vidhya and writing my learnings from the same. Previously, I have worked with frameworks like **Angularjs, Nodejs** and I learnt about software engineering architectures.

Currently, I am a North Yard Analytics Fellow, a soccer analytics enthusiast and have posted several articles on Medium regarding the same. I am highly interested in **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Soccer Analytics** and look forward to continue to solve real world problems in those domains.

I am interested in opportunities in Machine Learning, Data Science and Software Engineering. Feel free to contact me for the same.
