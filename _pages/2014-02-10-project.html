<h3><strong>Here are some projects I am doing or completed.</strong></h3>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/allenbo/distnet" target="_blank">DistNet</a></h1>
<p>DistNet is a distributed convolution neural network. It takes cuda-conv as it's underlying convolution operations GPU-implementation and uses MPI as the communication interface. Â DistNet is able to scale to multiple GPUs to accelerate the training procedure. We tested on 4 GPUs with Alex's network and achieved 2.57x times speedup. And we are optimistic to believe that we could speedup more while scaling to 9 or 16 GPUs.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://rjpower9000.wordpress.com/">Russell Power</a>. Worked heavily with this great man.</p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/allenbo/py2cpp" target="_blank">Py2Cpp</a></h1>
<p>Py2Cpp is a top project that I am still working on to convert Python source code to C++ source code. Since some fundamental inconsistency between Python syntax and C++ syntax exists, I can't fully convert Python source code into C++. Now py2cpp only support minimal part of Python syntax. <span style="color:#993300;"><em>Currently stop developing, you should move to <a href="http://shed-skin.blogspot.com/">this link</a>.</em></span></p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/allenbo/easyblog" target="_blank">EasyBlog</a></h1>
<p>Easyblog is a practice of django framework with Python. Tried to build a blog management by myself, I spent three weeks to write easyblog. Since I was interrupted by other project, currently I stopped developing easyblog system.</p>
<h1>Cell</h1>
<p>Cell is a distributed Btree built on top of infiniband. With infiniband's low latency, high speed and kernel bypass capability, Cell is a remarkably fast distributed Btree.</p>
