message: "I'm trying to get a handle on the numbers.  Based on what you say, the rewards per day on the S9 would be about $34.23\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/search?ei=SL0jW-HQAs20zwLa1rTwAQ&q=how+much+is+0.0052685+bitcoins&oq=how+much+is+0.0052685+bitcoins&gs_l=psy-ab.3...261393.264577.0.265798.2.2.0.0.0.0.109.198.1j1.2.0....0...1.1j2.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.uv31C3ErGkw\r\n\r\nBased on that, you'd pay for the S9 in about 1 month without counting for electricity (34.23 X 30 = $1,026)\r\n\r\nSo that would mean if your electricity bill were < $1,026 month, you'd make a profit.  So if you're paying $0.10/Kwhr and using 33/day... 33X0.10 = $3.30/day which is $99/month.  So you should have made about $925/month.  Am I right or am I missing something?"
