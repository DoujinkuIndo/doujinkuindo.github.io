message: "I'm trying to get a handle on the numbers.  Based on what you say, the rewards per day on the S9 would be about <span>$</span>34.23\r\n\r\n[https://www.google.com/search?&q=how+much+is+0.0052685+bitcoins](https://www.google.com/search?&q=how+much+is+0.0052685+bitcoins)\r\n\r\nBased on that, you'd pay for the S9 in about 1 month without counting for electricity (34.23 X 30 = <span>$</span>1,026)\r\n\r\nSo that would mean if your electricity bill were < <span>$</span>1,026 month, you'd make a profit.  So if you're paying <span>$</span>0.10/Kwhr and using 33/day... 33X0.10 = <span>$</span>3.30/day which is <span>$</span>99/month.  So you should have made about <span>$</span>925/month.  Am I right or am I missing something?"
