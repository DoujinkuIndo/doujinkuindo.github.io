  Good job on the month earning season can be hard. Options are my favorite but
  you're right they are very hard to manage. I consider each trade even a losing
  one worth the money in tuition on how the stock market works. I've read and
  studied a lot of strategies and theories but there's no learning like jumping
  in yourself to see what happens.
