message: "Liked this post. If only everything was so simple.\r\n\r\nI am a software engineer. And I decided to take a break because I was miserable at work. And the moment I made that decision, something changed. In the next two weeks, I realized that I like my job. \r\n\r\nThe only things that changed is that I stopped going to unnecessary meetings and did my work the way it should be done, not concentrating on all the low hanging fruits.\r\n\r\nI now know, everything is in my head."
