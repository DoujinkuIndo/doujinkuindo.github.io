message: "Hey Joe,\r\n\r\nVery insightful! It happens to me all the time that I miss things I'm being told, because I can have an extremely mechanical mind. For example, my wife can tell me to take the wet clothes from the washer and put them in the dryer; and I will, but sometimes I won't turn on the dryer because she didn't ask me to. I don't automatically assume that unspoken next step. \r\n\r\nOh and I always have trouble with the word \"infamous\". To my logic, it should mean someone that is not famous!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMiguel"
