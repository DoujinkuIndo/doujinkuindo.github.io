msg: "Nice analysis! The math behind this gets tricky fast. I tried to do the math around this same analysis but adding on the idea:\r\n\r\n> What if you get a 3% raise every year and save it?\r\n\r\nThat makes the math MUCH harder. I know that would lower these times, but I'm unsure of how much that'd impact things. It would impact the lowest saving rate people the most, but be interesting to see how it impacts people in the middle range."
