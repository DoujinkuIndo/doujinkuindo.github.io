  Congratulations! I really like the way you laid out your goals in different
  categories. Our achilles heel is also eating out. My husband and I are
  challenging each other this month to not eat out at all. It's been a struggle
  but we are hoping it will enable us to start cooking more in the future as
  well. Good luck with your goals!
