message: "I started losing my hair in my 20s. I'm not bald, but my hair is sparse enough that I've worn a simple buzzcut for years. It's easy to maintain with my own clippers, and I just get a professional cut a couple times a year when it starts looking untidy around the back.\r\n\r\nI did Toastmasters for a few years, but lost track of my group after I moved. I may have to see if there's another group locally to join."
