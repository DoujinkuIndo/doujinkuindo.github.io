  Awesome goals--and I like the distinction between abstract and concrete, too!
  Also congrats on all the huge upcoming milestones!!!! I'm also pretty
  optimistic about 2018. I don't have sure thing increased income or anything,
  but I'm trying to do more things for myself personally and professionally. As
  I'm booking these big things I'm looking forward to, I'm realizing how much
  energy they can give you and how taxing it can be to put yourself on the back
  burner for an extended period of time.
