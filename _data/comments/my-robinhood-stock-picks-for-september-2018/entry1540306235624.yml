  Do you also invest in anything else besides stocks? Maybe bonds,
  cryptocurrency, valuable metals, forex? I find that diversifying your risk is
  best and investing a small percent of your income into different things will
  yield the best results over time. Take crypto for example: invest 2% of your
  monthly income, over 10 years, buying 20-40 altcoins and Bitcoin and you will
  be seating on a big chunk of change. If you get in now, while the prices per
  one coin are low, in a few years, you can make hundreds of times more.
