message: "Hi Joe!\r\n\r\nGreat list here! I've heard of Merch by Amazon and I was interested in looking more into it, but I'm not sure where to start. It's something I'll have to dig further into.\r\n\r\nI've made money by picking up free furniture and giving them a face lift. It's really fun too! Ok, fine... there are small up cost investments such as paint, paint brushes, and sand paper. But it's not too much! I've also made money by picking up free stuff (i.e. clothing in excellent condition) to sell. Honestly, I am surprised with the stuff these ppl give away sometimes... I've seen online ads where people are desperate for you to take away their stuff. It doesn't come up a lot, but I've tried it and it's not too shabby."
