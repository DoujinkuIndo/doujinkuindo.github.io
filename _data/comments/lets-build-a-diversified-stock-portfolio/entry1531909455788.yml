msg: "I primarily invest in index funds, but hold several direct stocks too. I will say the trade war talk this year hasn't been helpful in the most recent months on many of my individual positions, but my index funds have had a healthy 2018 for the most part. \r\n\r\nAnd, they're less maintenance than checking the headlines each week for each individual stock position to look for scandals, lost contracts, hostile takeovers, etc."
