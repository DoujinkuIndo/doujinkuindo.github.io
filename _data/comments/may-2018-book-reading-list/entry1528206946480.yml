  So cute! My parents read to me and I think it made me excel in English,
  reading comprehension, etc. Even if it seems like it isn't making a difference
  it probably is. And as you pointed out, for your own reading, at least you are
  ahead of last year. Improvement is improvement. I've read about 15 books this
  year so far, but then again, I don't have a baby to take care of.
