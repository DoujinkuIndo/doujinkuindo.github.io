msg: "My hat's off to you for recording this timeline of events! We had a similar experience with the crazy medical billing system surrounding childbirth services with the birth of our first son. In our case, we had contracted with a freestanding birthing center operated primarily by midwives, with a fallback option of a local hospital should it be necessary.\r\n\r\nWe began labor at the birth center, but complications resulted in a move to the hospital. We were fielding bills from the birth center, hospital services, and physician services at once! Throw in pre-payments, an HSA, and an out-of-state provider, and you can imagine the headache. We were billed in duplicate as well, and I can vouch for the fact that if we weren't on top of things would definitely have over-paid. \r\n\r\nCongratulations on a year of accomplishments, highlighted by the birth of your son!"
