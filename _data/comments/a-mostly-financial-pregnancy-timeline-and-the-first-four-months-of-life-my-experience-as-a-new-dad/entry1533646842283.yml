  I love these kind of thorough timelines with lots of numbers thrown in. I have
  always been in government work instead of big money lawyer jobs, but everytime
  (twice) I had a baby at the hospital and only had to pay a $300
  anesthesiologist bill, I was happy with my benefits. congrats on the good
  looking abby!
