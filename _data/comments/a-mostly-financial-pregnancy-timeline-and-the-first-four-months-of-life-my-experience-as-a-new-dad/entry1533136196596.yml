  Giving birth was probably the most expensive thing I've ever done... Add that
  up with a house flood right before I went into Labor, and my company being
  bought out and getting notice of my employment being temporary with the new
  company... and we've got the perfect trifecta. I'm SO broke. LOL, but she's
  worth it.
