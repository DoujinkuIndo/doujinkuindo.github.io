  Your son's a cutie! This is a really interesting look at pregnancy and
  finances. "If I hadn’t been on top of things, there is no way I would have
  known I don’t actually owe ten grand." This is the reason I force myself to
  stay on top of my medical expenses (of which there are many) and insurance
  matters, even though it sometimes sounds like Greek to me. I can only imagine
  how many people pay bills they don't owe because they haven't tracked what
  their insurance does.
