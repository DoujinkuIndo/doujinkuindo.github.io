  I’ve installed analytics and I also use Adsense as an indicator. Alexa was
  mentioned to me and I’ve used it a couple of times. But I think I’m going to
  start ignoring my traffic stats for now bc I find that it can be distracting
  to me haha! I’m just going to blog at my pace and learn what I can. I don’t
  want to feel discouraged from seeing odd swings in my traffic >.<
