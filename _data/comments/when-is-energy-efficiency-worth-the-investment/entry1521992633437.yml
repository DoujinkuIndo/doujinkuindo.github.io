  I'm not sure what you think of your car example.  The question posed was How
  much should you pay for a car that gets 50 mpg?  Your answer is $7,200, which
  is inflated PV because you neglected the return rate.  Because you are not
  going to find a new car for $7,200, and extremely unlikely to find even a used
  car, the decision should be keep driving the current car until it's dead.  The
  largest cost of a car is the capital expense.  If you have a paid off car-
  keep driving it.  This also provides the opportunity to save for the next
  car.  If you actually have the money in hand, invest it and earn more.  When
  you are in the market for a car, you can compare the standard efficiency and
  high efficiency models this way too determine if the EXTRA cost is worth it.
