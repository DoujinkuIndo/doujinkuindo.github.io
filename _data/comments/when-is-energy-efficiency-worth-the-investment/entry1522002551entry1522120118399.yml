  Yes, I was trying to indicate present value with PV. I agree, you have to make
  some assumptions but only time will tell how good some assumptions are.  A
  couple years ago we would have assumed gas prices would continue to be more
  than $4/gallon.  I think we agree, even with assumptions and simplifications
  it helps to run the numbers.
