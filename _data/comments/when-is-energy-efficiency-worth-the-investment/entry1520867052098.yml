  Well done. I spent my career evaluating capital projects for the complex I
  worked at. We typically didn't fund projects that took longer than three years
  to payout, with the exception of energy saving projects that we'd accept maybe
  a five year payout on. But that was because we had more projects than we had
  money to invest. For a family 8 to 10 year payback is probably about right.
