msg: "Steve Thanks for sharing,\r\n\r\nI test and analyze existing and new home efficiency for a living, and I would love to add some of the nuances to the discussion. The problem is that when most people including many mechanical engineers are \"running the numbers\", the assumptions being used don't match the reality of the building.  Question, should I add insulation or air seal or both? That's easy every ignores air sealing because they don't measure it or understand how it impacts the insulation ability to work. So they insulate but don't get the return cause the insulation doesn't work as expected.  So in addition to running the numbers, validating the assumptions is important, otherwise all you end up with is deemed savings which aren't as good as actual returns.  \r\n\r\nSo with the LED example the important factors are to get a light has a high lumen per watt ratio at a minimum, and if adoption is important, get one the matches the quality of light being replaced. To get the answer for lighting you need frequency of use, so the kitchen lights will have a faster payback than the back closet, even with same bulb swap.  Another factor that comes into play is that the reduction in watts from incandescent = reduction in BTU's, 1Kwh=3412BTU/hr.  One Ton of cooling capacity is 12000Btu/hr so replacing the lights can have a substantial internal gain reduction. If you don't use ac or any types fans to cool, maybe you get to sweat a little less (priceless) If the lights are located in recess fixtures exposed to an attic it gets more complex because of the heat transfer through the attic.  \r\n\r\nThere is one other factor to consider in payback that doesn't occur in most other investments.  What is the tax rate on gains from efficiency measures?  if you have a simple payback of 10 years, and the life of the improvement is 30 years, you have no tax on the investment \"returns\" that you experience in year 20-30. Even better your tax rate may be negative due to government incentive.  As the FI community well understands a dollar that you never have to spend is way better than a dollar that you have to generate by work or investment income.\r\n\r\nCalculating the ROI is like creating a budget, looking back on your expenses after the fact helps you to calibrate the budget to reality."
