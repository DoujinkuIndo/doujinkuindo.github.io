message: "Nice analysis! I used to do the same thing, chipping in what I could when I could. My mortgage issuer even had a bi-weekly plan where they showed how much sooner you could pay off your mortgage if you used that. In addition to paying more often, you got the bonus of getting an extra months worth of mortgage paid each year.\r\n\r\nNot a huge difference, but still better than going with their default pay off rate."
