  These are great points! I've heard a lot of people talk about the $$ they save
  making twice monthly payments - so I was going to sign up to do the same (on
  our old house; we're renters now!) but then I realized the company actually
  CHARGED US EXTRA to do it that way - I was so annoyed when they presented as a
  way to "save money" because I bet a LOT of people actually bought into that.
