  Hey Joe, Staticman sounds really interesting, I'm curious to see it in action!
  I'd used Disqus when I tried Jekyll and was overall happy with it, but at
  least with Staticman the comments aren't on a third party. I really like the
  idea of Jekyll, but I just found it too fiddly overall, for reasons like this!
