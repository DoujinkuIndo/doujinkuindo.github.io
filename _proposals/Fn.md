title: Serverless functions with an open-source FaaS platform
permalink: /Fn/
---

### Abstract

FaaS (Function as a Service) is the new black as it radically change how code is developed, deployed, and charged for. This hands-on session will introduce you to Fn project (https://fnproject.io), an open-source container-native FaaS platform. We will start by looking at Fn and how we can create and deploy serverless functions using various languages (e.g. Go, Java). We will then discuss more advanced topics such as functions orchestration, how to leverage GraalVM to tackle the cold-start issue, how to add support for other languages, etc.

By the end of this session, you will have a good understanding of how Fn works and the benefits an open source FaaS platform can offer.
