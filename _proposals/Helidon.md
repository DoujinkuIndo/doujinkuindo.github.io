### Abstract

This technical session will introduce you to Helidon, a collection of Java libraries for building microservices and its two programming models: MicroProfile, for those wanting inversion of control and familiar with Java EE (now Jakarta EE) APIs, and Helidon Native, for those wanting a lightweight, functional model. Live-coded demos will illustrate the Helidon reactive web server, the config, and the security APIs.
