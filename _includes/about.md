Some information about Danh Truong!

### More Information

I am a post-doc at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center. I study mesenchymal tissue differentiation as a model for understanding the plasticity of soft tissue sarcomas and osteosarcoma. My favorite book series is the The Expanse but I also love The Lord of the Rings and The Legend of Drizzt series.
