## 1. The Browser Triad
### Learning Objectives
### Terminology

### Activity: From Print to Web
You will be working in groups of 3 or 4 for this activity.

Identify common examples of visual hierarchy in the print document you selected as homework. 
- Does the pattern or technique have a name? 
- How do they apply to Web documents?
- Would this pattern or technique be implemented using HTML or CSS?

## 2. Long Form Text
### Learning Objectives

### Activity: Your first HTML blog post
You will be working in pairs for this activity. 

Take either/both articles you have chosen and code them in HTML (using Codepen). Start with the following HTML tags:
- `h1`-`h3`: headings
- `p`: paragraphs
- `a`: anchor
- `strong`, `em`: bold and italicize
- `ul` and/or `ol`: unordered and ordered lists

See: [HTML text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals)

## 3. Lab Time: Optimize and Validate
1. Clean up your code!
2. Migrate your final Codepen code into an HTML file in VS Code.
    - Link to an external stylesheet using a `link` element in the `head` of your HTML document.
