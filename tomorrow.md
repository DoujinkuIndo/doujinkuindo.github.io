## 1. Tissue Contrast Illusion
See Objectives 1 and 2 in the [Tissue Illusion Coding Challenge](http://browsertherapy.com/challenges/tissue-contrast/)

## 2. Hero Sections
1. Using viewport units, we'll expand the height of the `header` element so that it covers more than 50% of the page.
2. Use the following properties (and Lorem Picsum) to add a background image to your `header` section:
    - `background-image`
    - `background-size`
    - `background-position`
3. Using Flexbox, position (and `color`) your text on the background image so that the text is readable.
