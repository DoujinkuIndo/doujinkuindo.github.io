# Mixing and Matching Gender: The Interaction of Gender Assignment Rules in Spanish-English Bilingual Speech#

Abstract: 
This paper investigates how codeswitching (CS) functions for Spanish-English bilingual speakers in utterances that feature noun phrase (NP) ellipsis and one-substitution, with particular focus on how the gender assignment rules of each language apply with regards to the elided and substituted material. Recent research has shown that when a switch occurs within an ellipsis site, the language of the elided material can be inferred from case markers on the remnants, and that further research on how gender markers function similarly is necessary (González-Vilbazo & Ramos, 2018). In addition to NP ellipsis, this paper investigates how gender markers can reveal information about the substituted material when a switch occurs within a one-substitution construction. 
This study employed an acceptability judgment survey which was designed to test bilingual speakers’ judgments of switched constructions involving NP ellipsis and one-substitution. The results suggest a syntactic analysis in which the remnant adjective plays an important role in assigning gender. In this analysis, the language of the elided referent is initially assumed to be the language of the antecedent. The remnant adjective signals whether the NP is marked for gender, which is represented with the privative feature [GEN]. A [GEN] marker requires that the elided NP, or referent, be marked [±FEM]; if it is not, a language switch is forced at the site, and the remnants will agree with the gender of the referent. Lack of a [GEN] marker means that the referent is not required to bear gender markers, and a language switch at the site is optional. If the elided referent is not marked [±FEM], the remnants will default to masculine markers. This analysis draws on previous investigations into CS and gender assignment, including research conducted by Merchant (2015), Valdés Kroff (2016), and Cruz (2021). The result is a set of proposed gender assignment rules which govern the syntactic structure at sites of codeswitched NP ellipsis and one-substitution.

This research project served as my Senior Honors Thesis at NYU in 2022 and received High Honors. The full text is available (https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/linguistics/documents/Winship%20(2022)%20Honors%20Thesis.pdf "here").
