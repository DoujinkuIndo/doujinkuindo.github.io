<h3>Getty Graduate Intern Digital Humanities Project</h3>
<p>The Getty Graduate Intern Digital Humanities Group seeks to identify and develop strategies for the collection, organization, and most importantly visualization of large sets of art historical data, beginning with data from the digitized Knoedler Gallery stockbooks. Through a multi-disciplinary, cross-campus (GRI, Museum, and Publications) approach, we combine technology and traditional scholarship in the service of creating an art market data repository with visualization tools and methodologies intending to develop scholarly research and interest in the field. Additionally, we are considering this with a view towards institutional applications. </p>

<h3>Project Team</h3>
<h4>Kelly Davis, Content Specialist</h4>
<p>As the initiator of this project, Kelly is actively contributing to the compilation of Knoedler database for the GRI. Her expertise in this field provides the context and backbone of art historical research to the project.</p>

<h4>Nathaniel Deines, Research Technologist</h4>
<p>Nathaniel is a researcher and project manager with a background in the philosophy of technics. He analyzes the variety of digital platforms available to the research community, identifies project-appropriate digital tools, and formalizes research methodologies in a digital context.</p>

<h4>Lisa Banks, Content Manager</h4>
<p>Lisa is an artist with a background in digital media production. She oversees project administration and creative development, facilitating production by identifying key contributors and resources, systematizing tasks and designing presentation of visual content.</p>

<h4>Stephanie Grimes, Digital Project Editor</h4>
<p>Stephanie’s background in both art history and publishing allows her to negotiate the needs of both disciplines to produce engaging digital projects. She researches the art historical context, audience demand, and project scope to determine the digital platform, design, and architectural information of the project.</p>

<h3>Project History</h3>
<p>In the fall of 2014, four Getty graduate interns with various backgrounds working in different departments met over lunch to discuss innovative research tools that enhance the study of digital art history. While each team member approached the subject from a different perspective, they all shared the same goal: to pursue a collaborative digital humanities project using resources available at the Getty. Serendipitously, one of the interns was working with the Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance (PSCP) transcribing records from the Knoedler stock books (link). The team quickly realized the data created by the PSCP was perfect for a DH project—structured, linear and easily accessible, as the GRI makes the records freely available for downloading. </p>
