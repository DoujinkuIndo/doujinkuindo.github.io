### Helloooo Again Foodies!!! 
Don't be disheartened by the title, I promise its worth it.

If you are a foodie like me, trying out various dishes and recepies, plus a "vegetarian" you know that Raw banana is a mild replacement for
potatoes.So today's dish is [Raw-Banana-Stir-Fry](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/raw-banana-stir-fry-recipe/).

Do check it out , it has an elaborate explanation of each step. I followed each step and it turned out pretty good.

It's a very low effort dish and if you are bachelor/bachelorette it is something you would wanna include in your easy to make
dish. So go ahead,try out the recepie link and let me know how it goes.

Thank to you, @dasanna!! Keep doing the awesome work you do!

Don't Stay Hungry,Keep Cooking!!
