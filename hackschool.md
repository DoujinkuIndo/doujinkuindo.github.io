<center>ACM Hack School is a quarter-long program that will teach beginners to build their personal web applications (like their own Twitter or Reddit from scratch). It assumes no prior knowledge, will open-source all of its code, and is adopting diversity as a goal from the start. It will aim to have ~40 students that meet for weekly workshops. Students will leave with full knowledge on how to build real-world applications.</center>
