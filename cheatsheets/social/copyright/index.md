### [Copyright claim vs Copyright strike](https://vidiq.com/blog/post/monetize-youtube-channel-copyright-claim/)
<dl>
  <dt>Copyright claim</dt>
  <dd>"When you receive a copyright claim, YouTube, as a third party, is basically saying that you the creator, can use the copyright ownerâ€™s content, but the owner of that copyrighted content has the right to place adverts on your video and earn income from it."</dd>
  <dt>Copyright strike</dt>
  <dd>"If the owner asserts their rights to their own content, your video will be removed from your channel and you will also receive a copyright strike. Three copyright strikes and your channel will be terminated. In extreme cases, you could find yourself in legal hot water and have to defend yourself in court."</dd>

- [Problems with Soundtrack: Twitch does not have sync licenses for streaming recorded music](https://youtu.be/E7wnROhHBH4?t=2087) 
  - To make a song stream safe: a platform has to secure **master recorded rights**, **publishing rights** and **mechanical licenses** (to release the music).
  - Additionally:
    - to use music in a public setting, a **public performance license** is required;
    - for music used in a video setting such as an advertisment, film or _recorded livestream_, a **synchonization license** is required.
  - _Allegedly_, Twitch has not paid for synchonization licenses (the most expensive of the bunch).
