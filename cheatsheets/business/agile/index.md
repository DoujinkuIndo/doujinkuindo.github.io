  - In practice:
    - Each process issues requests (kanban) to its suppliers when it consumes its supplies.
    - Each process produces according to the quantity and sequence of incoming requests.
    - No items are made or transported without a request.
    - The request associated with an item is always attached to it.
    - Processes must not send out defective items, to ensure that the finished products will be defect-free.
    - Limiting the number of pending requests makes the process more sensitive and reveals inefficiencies.
