## <center>Who is this for?</center>{: .acm-blue }

<center> Targeted towards students with little to no experience, our goal is to host a hackathon to bring students together to build cool things. 
If you've never written a line of code before, don't worry, this hackathon is designed for you.<br><br>

Workshops will be held throughout the day to give students the skills needed to build a project. Mentors will be eager to help you turn your ideas into a reality! </center>
