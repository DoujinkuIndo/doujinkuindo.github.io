### Standard package is $200 for a full Aerial Photography mission, locally

#### _**Drone Mission Pricing**_

* I am a commercially licensed and registered UAV Pilot. I have insurance for my drone flights. I am an experienced Aerial Photographer.

#### I have 3 batteries, each of which lasts 34 minutes.

* I charge "by the battery" for my services. To exhaust all 3 batteries will cost $200. For me to "get some quick shots" I will fly until my first battery dies, that will cost $80. Adding an additional half hour will be $80, and the third is half-off, $40. I can provide drone photography services for _as little as $80, **my standard package being $200**_.

I recommend that on any shoot we use all 3 of my batteries. Total, I would fly roughly 90 minutes to capture dozens of photos. Between each battery I will review the images and be able to make immediate improvements to the shots. Using three batteries gives you two opportunities to review these photos with me immediately before I fly again, giving us a great system to be precise about the photos we truly want.

#### _**Controlled Airspace**_

**This applies to CDA and Spokane only** but there are additional considerations when flying in or near controlled airspace. Based on your address I will determine how our flight will be affected by controlled airspaces (usually, height cielings) or if I will need to request Airspace Authorization (which I am licensed to do). Because of these additional airspace considerations in these areas, I charge an additional $50 fee per mission in the general area of CDA and Spokane. This ensures an FAA compliant flight.

#### _**Travel Compensation**_

**Within 20 minutes of Sandpoint, ID**: No transportation compensation required. 

* Local service: Sandpoint, Dover, Kootenai, Ponderay and near parts of Sagle.

**20 minutes out of town or more**: $1.50/mile, one way. 

* ~$20 to Garfield Bay or Rapid Lightning Road, 
* ~$30 to Priest River, or Clark Fork
* ~$100 to Spokane, WA or Troy, MT
