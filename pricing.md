#### _**Travel Compensation Pricing**_

* **Within 20 minutes of Sandpoint, ID**: No transportation compensation
* **20 minutes out of town or more**: $1.50/mile, one way

#### _**Drone Mission Pricing**_

* I am a commercially licensed and registered Drone Pilot. 

#### I have 3 batteries, each of which lasts 34 minutes.

* I charge "by the battery" for my services. To exhaust all 3 batteries will cost $200. For me to "get some quick shots" I will fly until my first battery dies, that will cost $80. Adding an additional half hour will be $80, and the third is half-off, $40. I can provide drone photography services for as little as $80.

I recommend that on any shoot we use all 3 of my batteries. Total, I would fly roughly 90 minutes to capture dozens of photos. Between each battery I will review the images and be able to make immediate improvements to the shots. Using three batteries gives you two opportunities to review these photos with me immediately before I fly again, giving us a great system to be precise about the photos we truly want.
