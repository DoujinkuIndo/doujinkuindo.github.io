I have no idea what I am doing or if this will work. If so hip hip horray!

Which research methods do you most want to learn?
  How to do this and navigate this site, for starters. Personally I feel learning how to navigate this site and how to code, if that is what this is, would be an acomplishment. I have always done my work in math and engineering not using computers, so learning how to do something digital would be very interesting to me. I have an idea of what I think "coding" is, and to learn/reasearch more into it is something I would like to try and do.
What topics in digital humanities research interest you?
  Any part of it really. I am not sure what digital humanities research is, and was hoping to try and find something new out. From our lectures so far, it is something that is definately new to me. What topics their are I am not fully aware of yet, but anything new would be interesting to me.
Which digital literacies do you most want to master?
  Simulation would be something that I want master. Being able to construct things in the real world for live use is amazing to see.
