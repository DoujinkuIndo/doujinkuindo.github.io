## Project 2: Unsupervised Image Seqmentation
<p>Objective:<br><br>

Use k-means clustering for image segmentation and to identify dominant color in the image.<br>
Question:<br><br>

Display the image “dog.jpeg”. Convert the image in to numpy array, so that it can be used in further processing<br>
Find out the dimensions of the image and convert it in to a two-dimensional array<br>
Use kmeans clustering with k set to 5 and cluster the image<br>
Predict the cluster label of every pixel in the image and plot it back as an image<br>
Find out the five dominant color in the image</p>

## Project 3: Time Series Analysis
<p>Domain – SEA Transportation focus –forecast demand Business challenge/requirement <br><br>

SeaPort is the largest operator of Sea Planes across sea shores in Europe.<br>
SeaPort doesn't have planes of their own, rather they lease themon a short-term basis based on passenger traffic. You as an ML expert have to builda model to forecast the demand (passenger traffic) of traffic.<br><br>

<b>Key issues</b><br>
As of now utilization of Planes is low due to poor forecasts of traffic<br><br>

<b>Considerations</b><br>
NONE<br><br>

<b>Data volume</b><br>
Approx 144 records–data month wise for last 12 years – file SeaPlaneTravel.csv<br>
<b>Fields in Data</b><br>
Month: Month in which traffic data was recorded<br>
'#Passenger': No of travellers availing Service in that month<br>
<b>Additional information</b><br>
-NA<br><br>

<b>Business benefits</b><br>
Better utilization of planes will lead to decrease in cost and hence better bottom line</p>

## Project 4: Association Rule Mining
<p><b>Market Basket Analysis</b> There is an online transactional data of a retail store containing the information of different items sold in different countries<br><br>
<b>Key Issue</b> As of now the company doesn't have a robust rule to club the items to maximize its sell Goal You as an ML expert have to build a model to forecast the demand (passenger traffic) of traffic<br><br>

<b>Strategy</b> We will apply apriori algorithm </p>

## Project 5: Breast Cancer Prediction
<p>Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.<br> Attribute Information:<br>

ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32) <br>
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: <br>

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) i) symmetry j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1) <br><br>

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.<br><br>

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.<br><br>

Missing attribute values: none<br><br>

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant</p>
