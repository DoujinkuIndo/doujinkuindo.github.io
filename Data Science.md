## Project 5: Breast Cancer Prediction
<p>Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.<br> Attribute Information:<br>

ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32) <br>
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: <br>

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) i) symmetry j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1) <br><br>

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.<br><br>

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.<br><br>

Missing attribute values: none<br><br>

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant</p>
