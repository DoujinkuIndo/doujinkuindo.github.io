I am a first year graduate student at the [Chennai Mathematical Insitute, Chennai](http://www.cmi.ac.in/) in [Computer Science](https://www.cmi.ac.in/teaching/courses.php?prog=msccs). I did my undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science from the same institute.

My research interests mainly include logic, algebra and automata theory.
I am particularly interested in language theory, semigroup theory, automata theory include quantitative topics like weighted and timed automata, MSO logic, type theory and model checking. Recently I have also become fond of learning language theory and automata in a categorical perspective.

I am currently an intern in IRIF, Paris (virtual) under the guidance of Prof. Thomas Colcombet and Prof. Daniela Petrisan.
