title: Miter Gate Concept for Local Drydock (Undergraduate Degree Project)
---

For the mechanical engineering degree project, my team and I approached local drydock in Thunder Bay, Ontario. We investigated the possibility of extending the drydock by 40 feet along the center line (which is just a bit shorter than the Hollywood sign).

Because this project is a multidisciplinary venture, we only focused on the mechanical engineering side of things, allowing future undergrads to explore from the point of view of other engineering disciplines.

## Structural Configuration

The miter configuration was the best option to achieve 40 feet extension along the center line of the drydock. Moreover, we chose this configuration so that the position of the hinges would be located at the same reinforced concrete steps.

Two leaves of the gate were designed to be at 46 degrees from the dock wall at the closed position. This results in 40.8 feet extension. One leaf measures approximately 55 feet (16.5 m) in breadth and 23 feet (~7 m) in height. Or 4 Honda Civics in length and 1 Orca whale in height.

Each leaf was designed with the buoyancy box to alleviate the force on the hinges. Buoyancy box takes 77% of the total weight of the leaf. The weight of the gate without buoyancy action is 219 500 lb (~100 tons). With buoyancy box in action, the weight is 50 800 lb (~25 tons). That’s approximately 5 healthy African elephants.

The internal structure of a leaf was conceptualized using ASTM and AISC structural members. We recognized that using marine specific custom structural members would have been an ideal choice; however, in order for us to abide by the theory acquired in the degree courses we decided to continue with the general of-the-mill standard structural members.

One leaf consists of 5 horizontal composite girders and 11 ST 10X33 Tee-girders. The horizontal composite girder is made from AISC MC 18 x 58 C-channel and ASTM W27 x 368 wide I-beam (For further details refer to the drawing package).

## Hinges

To allow for the rotation of the gate, we decided to go with the gudgeon and pintle on the top and bottom respectively. This configuration creates a pivot axis allowing the leaf to swing open/closed.

The leaf sits on the pintle, which supports its full or reduced weight. The pintle assembly is made of a fixed base, a pintle sphere and a socket. The base is fixed to the ground while the pintle sphere is placed on top of it. Since it is immersed in water, a dynamic seal is used to ensure the grease is sealed off from the environment.

At the top of the leaf, along the axis of rotation, gudgeon is anchored to the dock. The gudgeon has a barrel and pin that rotates inside of it. The assembly is greased using grease cavities in the pin.

The anchorage system was designed to support the miter gate leaf by connecting the gudgeon hinge to the ground. The 4-anchorage links were designed as tension and compression members which transfer the load to the ground.

## CONCLUSION

We started with an idea to extend the drydock by 40 feet, or about two adult giraffes stretched in peaceful slumber. Miter gate proved to be the best option.
