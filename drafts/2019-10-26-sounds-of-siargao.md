## Sounds of Siargao 

Pigs squealing for their breakfast,
Cocks (roosters) cocker-doodle-dooing, 
Birds chirping and shuffling in the coconut trees, 
The hum and honking of motorbikes, 
Well crank sqeaking
The chit-chatter of children playing, 
The cheap cheap of baby chicks following their mother hen around the pig pen,
Parents yelling out to their childen across the way. 
The excitement in the lead up to Fiesta. 
The smell of squid frying on Fiesta morning.
The neighbour's kareoke blaring through the warm air. 
The tap tap and bang bang of construction next door.
