### Contribute Content

_Contributing lessons is simple._
1. Add a markdown file to the posts folder. The filename should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-Lesson-#.md`
2. Add a hyperlink to the lesson in the table of contents in the index.html file.
3. The lesson must contain the following 3 components:
- Start with a description of the topic. Explain the topic in basic terms, so that a high-school student can read them and understand them. Write key words in bold.
- At least one set of practice problems. Place the solution key directly after the problems in a summary block labeled `Solutions`.
- At least one Minecraft activity, in which students can apply the topic of the lesson.
4. Content that is not essential should be labelled as an `aside`.

_Adding content to an existing lesson_
To add content to an existing lesson, check out a new branch. Then update the content and create a merge request. All content should correspond directly to the lesson. Content that is not essential should be labelled as an `aside`.


### Contributing Functionality.
This site is a fork of the Jekyll-Now template. Improvements of the functionality would greatly be appreciated. The goal is to have users submit Markdown files that will automatically be built into static sites.
