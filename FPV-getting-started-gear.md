## FPV

This whole article will be a lengthy read, but the first things I will mention are the cheapest options that I have found after many, many hours of FPV drone gear research. The goal is to put on VR goggles, be connected to a quadcopter, and fly around like a bird. The cheapest all-in-one solution I found was this TinyHawk drone which included a pair of very low-end goggles and a controller:

{% include image.html img_url="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/1_emax_rtf.jpg?raw=true" description="EMAX TinyHawk Ready-To-Fly" product_aff_link="https://emax-usa.com/products/tinyhawk-rtf-kit-including-googles-and-radio?ref=7P96ayzbPSlSj" %}

* $165 Ready-To-Fly "TinyHawk" WITH Controller and Goggles

I was shocked to find a system where all 3 components (the drone, the goggles, and the controller) were included for that price. 

* The goggles do not have a DVR function and the drone does not have a microSD card slot, so you would not be able to record footage with it. 
* You get what you pay for, the controller looks like its for a gaming console controller and its not a "serious" controller, but overall it would provide a "first experience" flying and would be fun.
* Typically, you buy your drone, goggles, and controller seperately. There are hundreds of options for that and millions of combinations of options for that, and so to make the process easier I've selected the cheapest/best options if you wanted the real deal for your controller and some better goggles. Once you have a good pair of goggles and a good controller, you can use those to fly on any drone. I think when you are starting out the best thing to invest in is the goggles and the controller. You don't just want a racing drone with 5 inch propellors powered by a 6S battery unless you already generally know how to fly it.

Next are the cheapest and best combination of components that I could find to purchase seperately. These are still cheap options, but much better if drones are something you are strongly interested in.

{% include image.html img_url="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/4_taranis_x9d.jpg?raw=true" description="(3/3) $218 FPV CONTROLLER: Taranis X9D" product_aff_link="https://www.amazon.com/FrSky-Taranis-Access-Telemetry-Silver/dp/B07VRP1V76/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20" %}

Total $540 before tax. The drone should come with a couple batteries and a charger. This is a very good controller (professional), the best of the cheaper style of goggles(box goggle, it has DVR), and a cheapo drone just to have something to fly. More drones are linked in the drone section of this page. You would probably want a good controller and goggles before you got a good drone, so flying a starter drone - a 1S battery class tiny drone - I think is a good move.

The three items above are a combination of a (1) VR Goggles, (2) a drone with a camera that connects to your goggles, and (3) a radio controller to fly the drone. I have found that the above products would be basically the most reasonable (cheapest while still being good quality) getting-started shopping list for FPV droning. The controller above has a charging port which allows you to charge it rather than deal with removing the battery from the controller to charge it, a little more expensive but I think worth it.

{% include image.html img_url="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/6_taranis_x7.jpg?raw=true" description="$125 Taranis Q X7" product_aff_link="https://www.amazon.com/FrSky-Taranis-Access-Telemetry-Silver/dp/B07VRP1V76/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20" %}

* Can be ~$200 cheaper with [$125 FPV CONTROLLER: Taranis Q X7](https://www.amazon.com/FrSky-Taranis-Channels-Transmitter-Controller/dp/B072559WH9?tag=juliusakula-20) and [$119 FPV GOGGLES: Fat Shark Recon](https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Recon-Goggles-Drone-Racing/dp/B07T27C78F/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20) instead. 

{% include image.html img_url="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/5_fat_shark_recon.jpg?raw=true" description="$119 Fat Shark Recon" product_aff_link="https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Recon-Goggles-Drone-Racing/dp/B07T27C78F/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20" %}

* Total would be $345 with the same cheap Mobula6 drone. With either of theses setups ($345-$540), you would be able to record footage in two ways: with the goggle's DVR function, or you can put a microSD card into the drone.

> If you have time to read more info about drones, the rest of this page covers many other options for the drones and different features you can choose when you are building your own drone. 

Drone setups become a lot more expensive when you try to make them capable of going 100MPH+, add GoPro cameras to your drone shopping list or try to make a drone have a range of 4+ miles with a long range Crossfire VTX (video transmitter). But your controller and your FPV Goggles will be able to connect to any FPV drone. That's why I put the real deal for the goggles and controller but a simple, $100 drone (in the "tiny whoop" category of drones) for the beginner/cheap setup. Every time you crash your $400 custom built drone, you risk needing to replace a motor or propellors. The inexpensive and semi-crash-resistant tiny whoop is a great learner's drone.

For the controller I chose the Taranis X9D over the Q X7 because while the Q X7 is $100 cheaper, it doesn't have the feature of simply being able to plug in the controller and charge it. The Q X7 you must buy a battery seperately and charge it which seems like a big pain. The X9D is a good controller that you could use for the [Drone Racing League Simulator game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/641780/The_Drone_Racing_League_Simulator/) game, or for any drone in real life.

The Scout and Recon are Fat Shark's budget options compared to their high end goggles. With FPV Goggles, you can connect two pairs to the same video feed when flying and have a spectator watch while you fly, so I plan on getting the cheaper goggles first and upgrading later and keeping my old ones. If I ever were to buy the [$699 DJI Digital FPV goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQQ5KQ6/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=3d54faceba12fe3c8dbfaa3dc9278635&creativeASIN=B07WQQ5KQ6) or [$739 Fat Shark HDO2(Dominator) FPV Goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083F815JV/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=45a4522ca246b3d7c7c35bd8e5bcf680&creativeASIN=B083F815JV) it would be cool to have a spare pair of goggles like the [$220 Fat Shark Scout](
https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Shark-Scout-FPV-Goggles/dp/B07V9TDG5G/ref=sr_1_2?tag=juliusakula-20) or [$130 FatShark Recon](https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Recon-Goggles-Drone-Racing/dp/B07T27C78F/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20) goggles to lend to a friend for a fly-along.

### Goals

{% include image.html img_url="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/8_mavic_air_2.jpg?raw=true" description="$The Mavic Air 2" product_aff_link="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Auto-Activated-Bundle-Drone-Quadcopter-ActiveTrack/dp/B08HJMM93P/ref=sr_1_4?tag=juliusakula-20" %}

* I am **extremely** interested in flying **Freestyle FPV** and **Racing**, so I have put a lot of research into how to get started with that. 
* [The Mavic Air 2](
https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Auto-Activated-Bundle-Drone-Quadcopter-ActiveTrack/dp/B08HJMM93P/ref=sr_1_4?tag=juliusakula-20) is an awesome drone for what it was designed for - [cinematic footage and photography (my blog post)](https://murdockfpv.github.io/Landscape-Photography/). It is not an FPV Drone because you do not wear FPV goggles. 
* The world of freestyle FPV and drone racing is a completely different world compared to the type of flying a Mavic does. Your goal as an FPV pilot is to get as close to your subjects as possible and do flips and acrobatics. 
* You may have seen [JohnnyFPV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJyPa7KIu6I&start=317 "JohnnyFPV YouTube Channel") on YouTube -- that style of flying looks like so much fun and it just isn't possible to do with the Mavic. 
* The Mavic doesn't allow itself to become upside-down (_something that happens halfway into a flip_). My Mavic Air 2 automatically stabilizes very well, and it is simply impossible to do flips. 
* FPV drones are cheaper, and flying Freestyle FPV you are **guaranteed** to crash your drone. You are almost guarunteed to crash your drone **multiple times** per "session", flying freestyle or racing.

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/26_drone_pile?raw=true" style="width:50%"/>

* FPV is a different and more advanced category than the photography category. My main goal with the Mavic Air 2 is to not crash it. 
* It is helpful to understand your goals with drones in order to know which drone is best for you. I was initially surprised to learn that there really is no such thing as a drone that "does it all".

### FPV Shopping list

> There are many, many different options when it comes to drones, controllers, and goggles.

### More options on Controllers and Goggles

#### FPV Controller:

There are a few components to an FPV setup. The first that comes to mind for me is the controller, also known as the _radio_. 

* Typically, an **FPV controller** is different than the Mavic-style controller, because the left stick is not centered. On FPV the left up-and-down stick movement controls _throttle_**, not** _altitude_, so by default the left stick on an FPV controller stays all the way down because the throttle defaults to off. 
* The left stick on the Mavic controller controls the _altitude_ and the stick centers itself in the middle similar to a joystick on an Xbox/PS controller. You can move the stick up or down to increase or decrease altitude, respectively, it is very simple. An FPV drone controller's left stick would not reset to the center, but rather would snap to the bottom and would control _throttle_ rather than _altitude_.
* At any rate, after much research, the [FrSky Taranis X9D](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VRP1V76/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=31dc48948db0bdc72a5f43178fcc9450&creativeASIN=B07VRP1V76 "FrSky Taranis X9D Plus on Amazon") is the controller I think I would purchase.

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/4_taranis_x9d.jpg?raw=true" width=300 />

* This controller is one of many controllers that are fully integrated with the Drone Racing Simulator, so I can practice flying my drone without flying my drone - and risking consequences of flying a physical drone in the real world (crashes that damage the drone). The Drone Simulator uses real physics for its game engine - it is a game on PC, it connects to any real Drone Controller to the video game and with using real physics, it feels like almost the real thing, especially when you also have your FPV Goggles connected to the game as well. 

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/23_drl-sim.jpg?raw=true" width=300 />

* The Drone Simulator is an excellent way to practice. You could virtually practice flying your tiny-whoop or practice flying a racing drone with your real controller. You can also virtually fly at night and when it is cloudy, allowing the option to practice 24/7. This controller connects to any drone as well as any flight goggles. The [$220 Taranis X9D](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VRP1V76/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=31dc48948db0bdc72a5f43178fcc9450&creativeASIN=B07VRP1V76 "FrSky Taranis X9D Plus on Amazon") is fully featured... My favorite feature of the X9D over the Q X7 is that you can simply plug in the controller to charge it, whereas the Q X7 you must remove the battery and charge/swap the batteries for the remote control. That sounds like way too much of a pain, and the Q X7 remote doesn't even come with it's own battery. 
* Many racers are using Taranis and they have has been around a long time - there are many mods available for it and there's a huge community to support their controllers. 

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/6_taranis_x7.jpg?raw=true" width=300 />

* The [$120 Taranis Q X7](https://www.amazon.com/FrSky-Taranis-Channels-Transmitter-Controller/dp/B072559WH9 "FrSky Taranis Q X7 on Amazon") is cheaper but does not include a battery or have a simple plug-to-recharge function which made me feel like the extra $100 for the X9D was worth it for ease-of-use. There are several brands for controllers I just get the impression from Taranis and the silver X9D especially that that is a serious down-to-business drone controller.

#### FPV Goggles:

The next thing needed for an FPV setup are the goggles. Choosing a unit has been pretty tough for me, but I have discovered the contenders by researching goggles used by racing world championship winners.

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/12_DJI_digital_fpv.jpg?raw=true" width=300 />

* With no budget, I wouldn't hesitate to get the [$700 DJI Digital FPV Goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQQ5KQ6/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=3d54faceba12fe3c8dbfaa3dc9278635&creativeASIN=B07WQQ5KQ6 "DJI Digital HD FPV Goggles on Amazon"). Digital FPV (as opposed to Analog FPV) has a much higher range, higher video quality in your goggles, and just seems like the new thing that eventually most people will have (in my opinion). 
* There is a [$15 module](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMWTBJ9/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=244f65767a12fb94480c419cec08cf7a&creativeASIN=B08LMWTBJ9 "Analog Receiver Module Adapter Board on Amazon") that you can install into your [DJI Digital FPV goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQQ5KQ6/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=3d54faceba12fe3c8dbfaa3dc9278635&creativeASIN=B07WQQ5KQ6 "DJI Digital HD FPV Goggles on Amazon") to make them backwards compatible with analog drones, which is absolutely something I would do, and I would want to get [different antennas](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MT3RGWR/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=1618f261ce8735a4ba4da0a118fd06df&creativeASIN=B08MT3RGWR "iFlight HD Patch LHCP Directional Antennas on Amazon"). 

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/14_omni_anteanna.jpg?raw=true" width=300 />

* This whole setup would run over $700, just for the goggles part of the FPV setup (controller and drone bought seperately).

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/15_fat_shark_dominator.jpg?raw=true" width=300 />

* Fat Shark is another brand option for high-end goggles. Fat Shark seems to be a trusted brand for some time now, and the [$540 Fat Shark HDO "Dominator" Goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083QC5V7X/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=62835af7b5e317a600365a7670277597&creativeASIN=B083QC5V7X "Fat Shark Dominator HDO2 FPV Goggles on Amazon") seem to be a very popular choice. I trust they are doing something right.

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/16_fat_shark_crossfire.jpg?raw=true" width=300 />

* However, they are not that much cheaper than DJI and it is [$740 with all the accessories](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083F815JV/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=45a4522ca246b3d7c7c35bd8e5bcf680&creativeASIN=B083F815JV "Fat Shark HDO2 FPV Goggles + Module and Antenna on Amazon"), and that doesn't include a [battery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0711H4D3K/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=da34ce4891e9e6956c4b3325d39d4a66&creativeASIN=B0711H4D3K "Fat Shark High Capacity Headset Battery on Amazon").

* For additional reading (please come back!), [this article](https://blog.dronetrest.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-buying-fpv-goggles/) describes the difference between box goggles and low profile goggles. I think the new Fat Shark box goggles (The Recon and Scout) don't look so bad. The low profile goggles seems like everything would be too close to my eye balls and I just feel like I might get nauseous with those.

### Drones

#### My #1 reccomendation for a cheap, beginner, ready-to-fly drone would be:

<img src="https://github.com/murdockfpv/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/list-2021-01-03/2_mobula6.jpg?raw=true" width=300 />

* [$99 FPV TINY-WHOOP DRONE: Mobula6](https://www.amazon.com/Happymodel-Mobula6-Brushless-Crazybee-Controller/dp/B081F7ZG74/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20)

_Tiny Whoops_**:**

* So first things first a **whoop** is a drone which has ducts around the propellors. The ducts actually generate more lift for the drone and make the motors more effecient, despite the extra weight. 
* A whoop (with ducts) has a different chassis than a racing drone (with exposed propellors).
* Another added benefit of the ducting around your _propellors(props)_ is that it provides protection for flying indoors. You won't destroy your drywall flying down your hallway. 
* A tiny-whoop is tiny, compared to the cine-whoop class of drones which are a full sized drones with ducts meant to carry a high quality camera for slow, sweeping, cinematic shots. All the tiny-whoops I've seen have about 1 inch props. A cinewhoop has at least 3 inch props. A tiny whoop is a drone which is meant to be as small as possible rather than as powerful as possible. 

Advantages of tiny-whoop:

* The ducting around the propellors makes them ideal for flying inside
* Price point is much cheaper
* They will train you to fly drones better by using the same controller that you might use for a bigger, more powerful drone.

Disadvantages of tiny-whoop

* Not ideal for outside, affected by wind
* Battery class is 1S, or one-cell. Flight time of ~3 minutes
* Lower video transmission range

> There are so, so many options for drones, and build-it-yourself drones are the way to go for performace. Building drones yourself involves soldering wires and is a pretty involved process, but not too much for a resourceful person. You'd need to watch tutorials on soldering if you've never done that before. There is definetly a youtube rabbit hole for building drones. 

#### While I can't tell you from experience the best way to build a drone from scratch (There are youtube links below), I can show you some other very appealing ready-to-fly drones besides the Mobula6.

To get a cinewhoop in the air, you'd need to purchase a controller and goggles, and you'd need to spend $273 on the drone, or close to $530 if you want to add the gopro mount and a gopro to that drone. This cinewhoop with a gopro, the Taranis X9D controller, and Fat Shark Scout goggles altogether is about $970 - about the same budget as the Mavic Air 2 fly more combo - but you can fly inside, do flips and fly FPV using goggles!

#### Here are some youtube videos which can be food for thought as you consider _building your own drone._

* DRONE SIMULATOR!! [Nurk FPV "The First things you should buy when getting into FPV"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6NSeg-rD0c&list=PL8PM0sBqDJTHhTA9U-Q8c13RHr7gX3S54&index=1&t=7s). - About two minutes into the video he talks about buying a controller first, and playing the drone simulator before even buying a drone. Playing the drone simulator can make you a good drone pilot before you ever fly a real drone. Find the Drone Racing Simulator game on Steam.
* YOUR FIRST DRONE BUILD! [Joshua Bardwell - "FPV Drone Budget Build Full Tutorial - Part 1 - Assembly"
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEittnx42Zc&list=PL8PM0sBqDJTHhTA9U-Q8c13RHr7gX3S54&index=4). - This video's description contains SO MANY links... soldering tutorials and has links to soldering irons to buy and also every drone component in the video, you can buy and follow along to the video and viola you now know how to build drones. I think this is an excellent getting started series. Not very thrilling, but informative and educational.
* Building a Drone with $99 to spend [UAVFutures - "Build a PRO FPV Racing Drone for ONLY $99 Full guide - 2018 UAVFUTURES $99 Build"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFNGUDT_9_c&list=PL8PM0sBqDJTHhTA9U-Q8c13RHr7gX3S54&index=5&t=381s)

### In conclusion

I think anyone getting started might want to try a pre-built, ready to fly drone before they deep dive into building a drone themselves. The shopping list for a brand new entry level drone set-up would contain the following items: 

1. FPV Goggles.
2. Drone remote controller.
3. A drone, unless you just play the Drone Simulator.
4. Many LiPO batteries for the drone, and a LiPO battery charger.

If you'd like to race each other on the Drone Simulator add me on Steam: my Steam "Friend Code" is 43723941. The simulator can technically be played with a mouse and keyboard, but would be best with a real controller such as the [Taranis X9D](https://www.amazon.com/FrSky-Taranis-Access-Telemetry-Silver/dp/B07VRP1V76/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20).
