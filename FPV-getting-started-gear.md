> Curious about FPV and looking at getting started with Drones!? I put together some industry information as well as links to products you ought to buy if you are getting started with flying FPV!

## FPV

This whole article will be a lengthy read, but the quickest summary possible would be these 3 links:

* [$99 FPV DRONE: Mobula6](https://www.amazon.com/Happymodel-Mobula6-Brushless-Crazybee-Controller/dp/B081F7ZG74/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20)
* [$219 FPV GOGGLES: Fat Shark Scout](
https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Shark-Scout-FPV-Goggles/dp/B07V7Y3WX3/ref=sr_1_2?tag=juliusakula-20)
* [$218 FPV CONTROLLER: Taranis X9D](https://www.amazon.com/FrSky-Taranis-Access-Telemetry-Silver/dp/B07VRP1V76/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20)

Total $540 before tax. The drone should come with a couple batteries and a charger.

Can be ~$200 cheaper with [$119 FPV GOGGLES: Fat Shark Recon](https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Recon-Goggles-Drone-Racing/dp/B07T27C78F/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20) and [$125 FPV CONTROLLER: Taranis Q X7](https://www.amazon.com/FrSky-Taranis-Channels-Transmitter-Controller/dp/B072559WH9?tag=juliusakula-20) instead. Total $345 with the Mobula6 tiny whoop.

The three items above are a combination of a First-Person-View quad-copter, a UAV Radio (universal, is not included with the drone), and $200 goggles (goggles not included with the drone) instead of the $650 goggles JohnnyFPV uses, the [Fat Shark Dominators](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083QC5V7X/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=62835af7b5e317a600365a7670277597&creativeASIN=B083QC5V7X "Fat Shark Dominator HDO2 FPV Goggles on Amazon"). That would be the most reasonable getting-started shopping list for FPV.  

> If you have time to read more info about drones, the rest of this page covers many other options for the drones and different features you can choose when you are building your own drone. 

Drone setups become a lot more expensive when you try to make them capable of going 100MPH+, add GoPro cameras to your drone shopping list or try to make a drone have a range of 4+ miles with a long range VTX (video transmitter). But your controller (UAV Radio) and your FPV Goggles will be able to connect to any FPV drone. That's why I put a simple, $100 tiny whoop (that is the style of drone) for the beginner/cheap setup. Every time you crash your custom built drone, you might end up needing to replace an arm or motor. The semi-crash-resistant tiny whoop is a good learner's drone.

I chose the Fat Shark Scout rather than the Recon for the goggles because there are some key features on the more expensive model that I think are worth it and would last longer before the need for an upgrade. The two most important features to me are the fact that the Scout has two antennas instead of one, and the Scout has a port on it to connect to a ground station or an external monitor. At some point I might want to have two pairs of goggles because you can connect two pairs of goggles to the same video feed when flying and have a spectator watch while you fly. if I ever were to buy the [$699 DJI Digital FPV goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQQ5KQ6/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=3d54faceba12fe3c8dbfaa3dc9278635&creativeASIN=B07WQQ5KQ6) or [$739 Fat Shark HDO2(Dominator) FPV Goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083F815JV/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=45a4522ca246b3d7c7c35bd8e5bcf680&creativeASIN=B083F815JV) it would be cool to have a pair of the less expensive goggles like the [$220 Fat Shark Scout](
https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Shark-Scout-FPV-Goggles/dp/B07V9TDG5G/ref=sr_1_2?tag=juliusakula-20) or [$130 FatShark Recon](https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Recon-Goggles-Drone-Racing/dp/B07T27C78F/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20) goggles to lend to a friend for a fly-along.

### Goals

I, personally, am **extremely** interested in flying **Freestyle FPV** and **Racing** in the near future, and so I have put much research into a best shopping list for a beginner FPV Pilot. [The $1000 Mavic Air 2](
https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Auto-Activated-Bundle-Drone-Quadcopter-ActiveTrack/dp/B08HJMM93P/ref=sr_1_4?tag=juliusakula-20) is an awesome drone for what it was designed for - [cinematic footage and photography (my blog post)](https://murdockfpv.github.io/Landscape-Photography/). I don't consider it an FPV Drone because you do not wear FPV goggles. The world of freestyle FPV and drone racing is a completely different world compared to the shots you can do with a Mavic. Your goal as an FPV pilot is to get as close to your subjects as possible and do flips and acrobatics. You may have seen [JohnnyFPV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJyPa7KIu6I&start=317 "JohnnyFPV YouTube Channel") on YouTube -- that style of flying looks like so much fun and it just isn't possible to do with the Mavic - it doesn't allow itself to become upside-down (_something that happens halfway into a flip_). My Mavic Air 2 automatically stabilizes very well, and it is simply impossible to do flips. Plus the FPV drones are cheaper, and flying Freestyle FPV you are **guaranteed** to crash your drone. You are almost guarunteed to crash your drone **multiple times** per "session", flying freestyle or racing. FPV is a different and more advanced category than the photography category. My main goal with the Mavic Air 2 is to not crash it.

Now, on the subject of drones crashing, [Nurk FPV has a video (27:00+)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKVx8-43eZg) in which he shows that he packs _**6**_ drones for a flight/video shoot. That may seem excessive but if you watch FPV videos this is not unreasonable considering how often he crashes, and the video is eye opening to the experience of being a highly skilled pilot who travels to do video work for clients. I recommend watching a lot of videos if you are interested in FPV. It is helpful to understand your goals with drones in order to know which drone is best for you. I was initially surprised to learn that there really is no such thing as a drone that "does it all".

### FPV Shopping list

> There are many, many different options when it comes to drones, controllers, and goggles.

### More options on Controllers and Goggles

#### FPV Controller:

There are a few components to an FPV setup. The first that comes to mind for me is the controller, also known as the _radio_. 

* Typically, an **FPV controller** is different than the Mavic-style controller, because the left stick is not centered. On FPV the left up-and-down stick movement controls _throttle_**, not** _altitude_, so by default the left stick on an FPV controller stays all the way down because the throttle defaults to off. 
* The left stick on the Mavic controller controls the _altitude_ and the stick centers itself in the middle similar to a joystick on an Xbox/PS controller. You can move the stick up or down to increase or decrease altitude, respectively, it is very simple. An FPV drone controller's left stick would not reset to the center, but rather would snap to the bottom and would control _throttle_ rather than _altitude_.
* At any rate, after much research, the [FrSky Taranis X9D](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VRP1V76/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=31dc48948db0bdc72a5f43178fcc9450&creativeASIN=B07VRP1V76 "FrSky Taranis X9D Plus on Amazon") is the controller I think I would purchase.
* This controller is one of many controllers that are fully integrated with the Drone Racing Simulator, so I can practice flying my drone without flying my drone - and risking consequences of flying a physical drone in the real world (crashes that damage the drone). The Drone Simulator uses real physics for its game engine - it is a game on PC, it connects to any real Drone Controller to the video game and with using real physics, it feels like almost the real thing, especially when you also have your FPV Goggles connected to the game as well. 
* The Drone Simulator is an excellent way to practice. You could virtually practice flying your tiny-whoop or practice flying a racing drone with your real controller. You can also virtually fly at night and when it is cloudy, allowing the option to practice 24/7. This controller connects to any drone as well as any flight goggles. The [$220 Taranis X9D](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VRP1V76/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=31dc48948db0bdc72a5f43178fcc9450&creativeASIN=B07VRP1V76 "FrSky Taranis X9D Plus on Amazon") is fully featured... My favorite feature of the X9D over the Q X7 is that you can simply plug in the controller to charge it, whereas the Q X7 you must remove the battery and charge/swap the batteries for the remote control. That sounds like way too much of a pain, and the Q X7 remote doesn't even come with it's own battery. 
* Many racers are using Taranis and they have has been around a long time - there are many mods available for it and there's a huge community to support their controllers. 
* The [$120 Taranis Q X7](https://www.amazon.com/FrSky-Taranis-Channels-Transmitter-Controller/dp/B072559WH9 "FrSky Taranis Q X7 on Amazon") is cheaper but does not include a battery or have a simple plug-to-recharge function which made me feel like the extra $100 for the X9D was worth it for ease-of-use. There are several brands for controllers I just get the impression from Taranis and the silver X9D especially that that is a serious down-to-business drone controller.

#### FPV Goggles:

The next thing needed for an FPV setup are the goggles. Choosing a unit has been pretty tough for me, but I have discovered the contenders by researching goggles used by racing world championship winners.

With no budget, I wouldn't hesitate to get the [$700 DJI Digital FPV Goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQQ5KQ6/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=3d54faceba12fe3c8dbfaa3dc9278635&creativeASIN=B07WQQ5KQ6 "DJI Digital HD FPV Goggles on Amazon"). Digital FPV (as opposed to Analog FPV) has a much higher range, higher video quality in your goggles, and just seems like the new thing that eventually most people will have (in my opinion). There is a [$15 module](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMWTBJ9/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=244f65767a12fb94480c419cec08cf7a&creativeASIN=B08LMWTBJ9 "Analog Receiver Module Adapter Board on Amazon") that you can install into your goggles to make them backwards compatible with analog drones, which is absolutely something I would do, and I would want to get [different antennas](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MT3RGWR/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=1618f261ce8735a4ba4da0a118fd06df&creativeASIN=B08MT3RGWR "iFlight HD Patch LHCP Directional Antennas on Amazon"). It is also recommended to get a different head strap. This whole setup would run over $700, just for the goggles part of the FPV setup (controller and drone bought seperately).

Fat Shark is another brand option for high-end goggles. Fat Shark seems to be a trusted brand for some time now, and the [$540 Fat Shark HDO "Dominator" Goggles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083QC5V7X/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=62835af7b5e317a600365a7670277597&creativeASIN=B083QC5V7X "Fat Shark Dominator HDO2 FPV Goggles on Amazon") seem to be a very popular choice. I trust they are doing something right. However, they are not that much cheaper than DJI and it is [$740 with all the accessories](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083F815JV/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=45a4522ca246b3d7c7c35bd8e5bcf680&creativeASIN=B083F815JV "Fat Shark HDO2 FPV Goggles + Module and Antenna on Amazon"), and that doesn't include a [battery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0711H4D3K/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=juliusakula-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=da34ce4891e9e6956c4b3325d39d4a66&creativeASIN=B0711H4D3K "Fat Shark High Capacity Headset Battery on Amazon"). 

For additional reading (please come back!), [this article](https://blog.dronetrest.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-buying-fpv-goggles/) describes the difference between box goggles and low profile goggles. I think the new Fat Shark box goggles don't look so bad. The low profile goggles seems like things would be too close to my eyes and I might get nauseous.

### Drones

### My #1 reccomendation for a beginner, ready-to-fly, cheap drone would be:

* [$99 FPV TINY-WHOOP DRONE: Mobula6](https://www.amazon.com/Happymodel-Mobula6-Brushless-Crazybee-Controller/dp/B081F7ZG74/ref=sr_1_1?tag=juliusakula-20)

_Tiny Whoops_**:**

* So first things first a **whoop** is a drone which has ducts around the propellors. The ducts actually generate more lift for the drone and make the motors more effecient, despite the extra weight. 
* A whoop has a different chassis than a racing drone. 
* Another added benefit of the ducting around your propellors(props) is that it provides protection for flying indoors. You won't destroy your drywall flying down your hallway. 
* A tiny-whoop is tiny, compare to a cine-whoop which is a full size drone meant to carry a high quality camera for cinematic shots. All the tiny-whoops I've seen have about 1 inch props. Racing quads have 4-5 inch props. A tiny whoop is a drone which is meant to be as small as possible rather than as powerful as possible. 

Advantages of tiny-whoop:

* The ducting around the propellors makes them ideal for flying inside
* Price point is much cheaper
* They will train you to fly drones better by using the same controller that you might use for a bigger, more powerful drone.

Disadvantages of tiny-whoop

* Not ideal for outside, affected by wind
* Battery class is 1S, or one-cell. Flight time of ~3 minutes
* Lower video transmission range

> There are so, so many options for drones, and build-it-yourself drones are the way to go for performace. Building drones yourself involves soldering wires and is a pretty involved process, but not too much for a resourceful person. You'd need to watch tutorials on soldering if you've never done that before. There is definetly a youtube rabbit hole for building drones. 

#### Here are some youtube videos which can be food for thought as you consider building your own drone.

* DRONE SIMULATOR!! [Nurk FPV "The First things you should buy when getting into FPV"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6NSeg-rD0c&list=PL8PM0sBqDJTHhTA9U-Q8c13RHr7gX3S54&index=1&t=7s). - About two minutes into the video he talks about buying a controller first, and playing the drone simulator before even buying a drone. Playing the drone simulator can make you a good drone pilot before you ever fly a real drone. Find the Drone Racing Simulator game on Steam.
* YOUR FIRST DRONE BUILD! [Joshua Bardwell - "FPV Drone Budget Build Full Tutorial - Part 1 - Assembly"
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEittnx42Zc&list=PL8PM0sBqDJTHhTA9U-Q8c13RHr7gX3S54&index=4). - This video's description contains SO MANY links... soldering tutorials and has links to soldering irons to buy and also every drone component in the video, you can buy and follow along to the video and viola you now know how to build drones. I think this is an excellent getting started series. Not very thrilling, but informative and educational.
* Building a Drone with $99 to spend [UAVFutures - "Build a PRO FPV Racing Drone for ONLY $99 Full guide - 2018 UAVFUTURES $99 Build"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFNGUDT_9_c&list=PL8PM0sBqDJTHhTA9U-Q8c13RHr7gX3S54&index=5&t=381s)
* Building a drone with $200 to spend [$200 FPV Drone Build & Set Up! - The Rotor Riot Budget Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQOkRjt_h0&list=PL8PM0sBqDJTHhTA9U-Q8c13RHr7gX3S54&index=3)

___

#### While I can't tell you the best way to build a drone from scratch (check out the youtube links above), I can show you some other very appealing ready-to-fly drones besides the Mobula6.

A cinewhoop with a gopro mount: 

* [$240  iFlight green 3 inch cinewhoop 4S Drone](https://www.amazon.com/iFlight-Green-3inch-CineWhoop-Receiver/dp/B08CN6F6L1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?tag=juliusakula-20)
* [$18 Small 1S Battery (1550mah)](https://www.amazon.com/GOLDBAT-1500mAh-Softcase-Battery-Airplane/dp/B07LGYSGZH/ref=sr_1_6?tag=juliusakula-20)
* [$15 4S Battery Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Blomiky-14-8V-Battery-Charger-Balance/dp/B07ZD6PZWN?tag=juliusakula-20)
* [$27 3d printed gopro mount for the drone and GoPro 5/6/7](https://www.amazon.com/iFlight-Adjustable-Mounting-Bumblebee-Hornet-Cinewhoop/dp/B088D59W9W/ref=pd_bxgy_2/134-2264898-1544041?tag=juliusakula-20)
* [$230 GoPro Hero 7 Black](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO7-Black-Commerce-Stabilization/dp/B083CNLVN3/ref=sr_1_3?tag=juliusakula-20)

To get a cinewhoop in the air, you'd need to purchase a controller and goggles, and you'd need to spend $273 on the drone, close to $530 if you want to add the gopro mount and a gopro.

### In conclusion

I think anyone getting started might want to try a pre-built, ready to fly drone before they deep dive into building a drone themselves. The shopping list for a brand new entry level drone set-up would contain the following items: 

1. FPV Goggles.
2. Drone remote controller.
3. A drone, unless you just play the Drone Simulator.
4. Many LiPO batteries for the drone, and a LiPO battery charger.
