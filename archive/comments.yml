  access to resources is greater than the general public (or thief) has.\r\n\r\nTo
  protect against the DETERMINED and TARGETING thief is very very difficult as the
  perpetrator  only has to find one way in.\r\n\r\nWith features such as the one in
  HHC (above) it greatly reduces the risk you are exposed to. If you leave your BB
  in a taxi, at the airport, falls out of your pocket, someone pickpockets you - then
  this protects you in these cases. \r\n\r\nIf someone is specifically targeting you
  and your company - then it is a question of how many resources they have and how

content: Your point is valid, but this also depends on what your followers interests
  are and what your links appear to indicate on the DM. I like to auto DM new followers
  with links to my latest mega mix (a direct link to high quality mp3), and a link
  to a seperate mp3 page also loaded with new direct link high qual mp3s that our
  service promotes. I also include a link to our upload page. That's a Thanks followed
  by 3 links and i've never had an issue. Of course i'm not giving them any adverts
  or trying to sell anything. Now if they decide to select a different link on our
  navigation bar they will find out more on our various services. It seems that the
  younger tweeters in the music bizz or fans of the bizz appreciate the grind and
  like getting access to the music. I get tweets all day thanking me for these links.

content: "<p>Hi Annabel, \n it took me about 30min to do it all. However, it will
  only take less than 5min to download and run WriteMonkey. I'd suggest you do that
  first, make sure it works the way you want to work. If if does (and it did for me)
  then install the firefox addon, then if you want to write your pieces using the
  Markdown markup, then take the extra step.</p>\n\n<p>Start with step one, and progress
  from there.</p>\n\n<p>Look forward to hearing your thoughts and experiance in getting
  it up and going.</p>\n"

  <p>The primary benefit I'm getting from using WriteMonkey is that my screen is clear. No task bar, nothing. Pressing and holding the F3 key let's me 'peek' at what's behind, and F11 makes it a regular window. But fullscreen is where the love is.</p>

  <p>Also, to make it more readable, I'm using the Consolas font at 15 points in Silver on an almost, but not quite, black background.</p>

  <p>Loving it.</p>

  <p>Just found this forum post as well, and I quote:</p>

  <blockquote>They call it XPUnlimited as a trick to fool buyers into buying something that they cannot use. The legal issues are normally skillfully passed on to the end user so that the software company is not actually the one breaking the law but the person installing the software</blockquote>

post_title: Who should pay for Microsoft SQL installations that go wrong?
author_name: Ben Hamilton
author_email: ben@hamilton.id.au
author_url: http://ben.hamilton.id.au/
content: "I've now got it working and the following is the distilled version of how,
  hope it helps any others struggling with this:\r\n\r\n1. The support staff in Sage
  Business Solutions Melbourne (bless 'em) gave me a pointer that if \"Microsoft .NET
  Framework 4 Client Profile\" is installed it gives troubles. Therefore they suggested
  uninstalling it prior to commending an SQL 2008 install. I don't know why or what
  but this was step 1. Note that just doing this still gave me a failed SQL install.
  I'd love to know more about the 'why' here. I'd also like to have been informed
  earlier instead of after me jumping up and down and making phone calls. But that's
  a topic for another day. For now I'm very happy with their suggestion as it does
  appear to have contributed to a successful install, which is GOAL NUMBER ONE.\r\n\r\n
  \r\n\r\n2. During the install you get the option to set which account the SQL Server
  Database Engine uses, instead of setting to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM as per <a href=\"http://kb.sagesoftwareonline.com/cgi-bin/sagesoftwareonline.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=26994\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Sage KB26994</a>, leave it as the default. After the installation
  is complete you then go to services.msc and change it to Local System then.\r\n\r\n3.
  As per <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/955666\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft
  KB955666</a> you can't use a 'number' or 'pound' (#) sign in the path name. Now
  I did NOT have a pound sign in the path, but there was a space in one of the folder
  names and a 'plus' sign (+). So taking to heart Microsofts admonition, I copied
  the installer to a folder C:\\SQL2008ExpR2\\*.* and ran it from there.\r\n\r\nFollows
  is a list of the various errors I've seen during this process:\r\n\r\n\"MsiGetProductInfo
  failed to retrieve ProductVersion for package with Product Code = '{4AB6A079-178B-4144-B21F-4D1AE71666A2}'.

author_url: http://www.twistimage.com/blog
content: Contrary view? I'd say my view is exactly in-line with yours. What you're
  leaving out is strategy. My strategy (similar to the people you mention) is to to
  establish myself and my company (Twist Image) as a recognized authority. I am not
  attempting to monetize my content in a direct fashion (like the traditional media
  outlets). My Blog post the other day was about them and their strategy to charge
  for valuable content (and the perspective given by one of the world's leading media
  players). It was not about people like you and me. In fact, if you read the first
  chapter of my book (which you would have to pay for) or even dig deeper into my
  Blog (which is free), you'll note that my agency business and all of the amazing
  opportunities that have come from that have roots in the Blog and how it has helped
  establish my name and that of my agency by sharing with people our thoughts on new
  media.

content: "Mitch, you're right, your post is about what Sir Martin Sorrell said about
  media outlets.\r\n\r\nAs far as media companies surviving, I agree they either need
  to charge for content. Or adapt in some other way. I don't believe that getting
  a goverment subsidy is an acceptable business model, ok for a short term, unforeseeable
  event, but not as an ongoing business model.\r\n\r\nAggregating content is worthless
  without thoughtful curation. That is, unless a deliberate bias is introduced people
  won't be interested. To use my example above, people won't stick at a site that
  aggregates content about anything to do with skateboards. But the site that aggregates
  content about skateboards and curates that list so that it's bias is toward reducing
  pollution, that will appeal to that niche, better again is curation that add's commentary,
  thought provoking asides or shows application/use of the information.\r\n\r\nI believe
  the media industry is undergoing an 'adapt or die' phase now. How it turns out is
  anyones guess. Perhaps Sorrell can foretell that future than we can. But either
  way, as you point out, we're not in the 'media' business, and sharing our knowledge
  is essential if we're going to prove to our prospective and existing clients that
  we know how to do our thing well.\r\n\r\nBen."

content: "In a message to me, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/karolinecumming/\" rel=\"nofollow\">@karolinecumming</a>
  raises a question that I'll answer here in the comments:\r\n\r\nThe question (paraphrased)
  is: If a persons <strong>skills or products</strong> are their value, they can share
  (give away) knowledge for free. But if <strong>advice</strong> is their product
  how can they not charge for it?\r\n\r\nTo answer that, take the example of Mitch
  above, he gives away knowledge on his blog <a href=\"http://www.twistimage.com/blog/\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Twist Image</a>, makes money from his book <a href=\"http://www.twistimage.com/book\"
  rel=\"nofollow\">Six Pixels of Separation</a> and consulting fees. \r\n\r\nOthers
  do the same, like David Allen (famous for <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Getting
  Things Done</a>) who gives away knowledge via twitter, his blog and podcast. He
  makes money by selling other products, books, seminars, kits etc.\r\n\r\nI've heard
  it said \"that if content is king, context is god\" (link?). Sharing knowledge is
  the content. Just because you've shared it, doesn't mean the reciever 'gets' the
  context, the application to them. They may get a glimpse, but they'll pay for you
  to explain the context, explain and show how it applies to them so that they can
  benefit from it."

content: "Thanks Ben for fielding my question :)  and providing a great answer - you
  are right, there are many people out there who balance giving out *knowledge* (content)
  for free, while making money for their *skill* (context) in other ways.\r\n\r\nI
  think a key for me that you mentioned in the reply to Mitch is niche. Even though
  you were talking about media and aggregating content, I think that does apply to
  business owners (particularly micro/sme)... there is so much competition in every
  industry, and now that the likes of social media, blogging etc have made the world
  so much smaller the competition is even more fierce.  \r\n\r\nBy finding context
  in our own niche, we can find ways to become needed by that niche (and therefore
  have value they're willing to pay you for).  I see many business owners trying to
  spread their net too wide, hoping to catch anything and everything and not being
  specific enough to be truly deemed an expert. People will only pay for what has
  value specifically to them (that goes for both on- and off-line). \r\n\r\nSo Ben,
  I totally agree that knowledge given for free helps to establish the level of skill
  you hold (and that can't be a bad thing?). Your skill - whether it's advice, ability,
  product, service etc - then needs to be set in a valuable context to be able to
  sell it.  It seems to me that in business, value is determined by your niche, rather
  than the wider audience.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping me see this more clearly - you've
  helped me clarify my point of view on this subject!! :)"
