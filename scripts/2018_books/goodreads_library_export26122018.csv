In my courses on ecology and human nutrition we have used some of the scaling laws and I always found them intriguing. Only when reading this book I feel that I understand how these laws arise. West does a good job relating diverse properties of organisms, companies and cities to their sizes. When physicists talk about biology I am always sceptical. Luckily, West is only condescending in about 10% of the times (seriously, finding it unimaginable that the great progresses of biology in the 20th century are at the same level as the increase in understanding of physics show a certain lack of respect for other fields). <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the ideas of this book will surely stay with you.<br/><br/>Pet peeve: why do all plots have slightly different layouts?

As I foolishly pre-ordered it instead of buying it in the bookstore, I was already spoiled by some hard-to-miss reviews, both abut the quality as well as some plot points.<br/><br/>Being quite the former (okay, not that 'former') Potter geek I really wanted it to be good. The new material on Pottermore has made me somewhat cautious not to hold too great expectations. Though Rowling is clearly enjoying herself making new material (and still has lot's of love for her series), she seems do it for 'fun' rather than really bring something novel to the Potterverse. <br/><br/>Obviously, I enjoyed reading it. The script form does IMO not deviate too much from the often dialogue-oriented original series, and the descriptions about how the characters nonverbally react convey a surprisingly large amount of emotions. Sometimes it really feels good to be able to binge a whole story in a couple of hours.<br/><br/><spoiler><br/>Sadly, there are quite a lot of issues with the plots that are lacking - to put it mildly. People more adept in reviewing than me have given a more comprehensive list that me, but some things I really did not like:<br/>- Time traveling? teminator-style trolley lady? Voldemort and Bellatrix' daughter? Stuff bad fanfics are made of...<br/>- Poor professor McGonagall: after defending Harry multiple times against the ministry and death eaters she is being blackmailed by the very boy she tried to protect into acting as Umbridge...<br/>- Cedric becoming a death eater after loosing the Triwizard Tournament?!<br/>- Ron is apparently a loser in any time line. Seriously, in the books he was quite a nice and intelligent guy, here he only serves to make Harry and Hermione look good.<br/>- Bitter teacher Hermione.<br/>- Resistance Hermione with attraction to Snape...<br/></spoiler><br/><br/>Fans read it, but do not necessarily consider it canon, because not everything is to like.<br/><br/><spoiler><br/>As a small side note, it side with the voices to make Albus and Scorpio a couple. There is an amazing chemistry between these boys. Why not give the word a real gay pairing (other than an asexual 100 year old...)? They could do it for the Legend of Korra, why can't Rowling gives us a same sex pairing?

Instead Dennett argues for a multiple draft model which states that there is no stream of conscious experience. Like Hofstadter consciousness is assumed to be an emergent property of a system being able to be introspective.<br/><br/>This is a heavy book, crammed with a lot of ideas (some of them not easy to follow).

Of course, it is written in the Victorian ages after all, which was not exactly a liberating time for women. It should also be noted that most of them want at least to improve their situation and in the end William is as much a tool for Sugar as visa versa. <br/><br/>The ending: as a book that does not really has a plot, it is not as strange that it does not really has ending.

Seung gives a very clear and well structured overview of his ideas: from the concepts and principles of the connectome paradigm (basically the idea that a complete map of neuron wiring would allow us to completely understand the brain) to the techniques for constructing such a brain model to some philosophical consequences. <br/><br/>The reason that I give a relatively low rating is that I found the book quite full of 'hot air' (I also thought this of Seung's TED talk). Being a bioinformatician myself, I recognize the same type of hype that was around the human genome project. We can sequence a person for less than a year's wage, yet not all genetic diseases have been vanished from the face of the earth. Similarly, Seung does not really delve in detail how we will use the connectome to read memories or cure depressions. Though, this might be just me nitpicking.<br/><br/>It is also hard to take someone serious who 'mocks' genetics, but at the same time claims neural wiring is the holy grail to solve all of our eartly problems (literally). <br/><br/>On the whole this is an enjoyable book, but from a scientific point of view, it is a bit too 'shallow'.

He is not the first, nor will be the last popular science author to be this, but it quite insufferable of him to keep repeating that he has surpassed Darwin and can make every (important) thing in nature clear by performing his subfield of thermodynamics. Of course prof. Bejan keeps reminding us that it is only natural that the ignorant masses can't recognize his genius. (And he doesn't like Communism).<br/><br/>The so-called constructal law is extremely vage. Design in nature arises to maximizes a 'flow'. What kind of flow? Would it prefer a flow of 100 l of water per second or of 100 l of air? Is there some theoretical derivation of this law, based on the laws of thermodynamics? Why don't I know this if I have read the book?<br/><br/>No formal discription of the law is given. Every chapter contains a couple of (rather badly structured) examples. Though some of them are quite interesting, I fail to see any need for any constructal low. Trees are tree-shaped because they need to keep a flow of water (to transport nutrients, keep their cells turgid and keep their floem moving). This could be predicted by the principles of evolution, same for the animals' movement.<br/><br/>In short, this book could be really interesting but should have been better (and more critically!) edited. <br/><br/> ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In my opinion the imagination of Moers is superior than, for example, Rowling's as he goes farther than merely building on folclore but creating a world completely of his own which, although perhaps somewhat silly, is also taken seriously and consequent through the different novels. <br/>If you liked the classical fantasy books as a child such as Rowling, Dahl or Carrol than this is probably a nice guilty pleasure.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
