## Use a zip-close bag
Liquids can be surprisingly harmful to unprocessed film. Placing your **film + order form** inside a plastic zip-close bag gives you added peace of mind and protects your investment.

## Use a box + plenty of cushioning
We have seen more than one roll of film lost into the postal abyss because it was sent in a flimsy envelope! Don't be that guy. Place your bagged film + order form inside a **box** and use **plenty of cushioning** to ensure your film's safe journey. (Pro tip: [USPS Priority Mail boxes](http://store.usps.com/store/results/free-shipping-supplies/shipping-supplies/_/N-alnx4jZ7d0v8v) are free.)

## Get a tracking number
We _highly recommend_ you send your film via a trackable method to ensure its safe arrival. Your film is precious cargo!

## Sending in more than one shoot?
No problem! Please fill out **one order form per shoot** and **separate** each shoot + order form into its own zip-close bag.

## Where do I send my film?
