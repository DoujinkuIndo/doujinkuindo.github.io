##### Develop + Scan — Current Service Time
##### Develop + Scan + Print — Add 1 Business Day to Current Service Time

_Service times are given as **good faith estimates** and may fluctuate while your film is in the lab._

_Service times are ultimately dependent on the volume of work coming in from our photographers._

_Service times are in business days starting the first business day **after** your order is received. Our service times tend to increase in Summer and Fall, when incoming film is high (i.e. wedding season) and decrease in late Winter._
