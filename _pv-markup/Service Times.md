Service times are given as good faith estimates and are ultimately dependent on the volume of work coming in from our photographers. Turnaround times are in business days starting the first business day after your order is received. Our Service Times tend to increase in the Summer and Fall, when incoming film is high (i.e. wedding season) and decrease in late Winter.
