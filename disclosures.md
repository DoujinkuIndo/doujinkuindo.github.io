I regularly disclose security vulnerabilities to organisations. Where possible, I'll provide reasonable assistance and clarification to help you fix these, for free.

Publishing information about these vulnerabilities is important and necessary, especially where it involves customer data. If an organisation does not intend to fix a vulnerability, I will publicly disclose this vulnerability, so that customers/stakeholders are properly informed of the risk.

If I find a serious vulnerability, I first disclose it in private to the organisation, to give them the opportunity to fix it. Then:
* If I've had a response from the organisation, I will wait at least 90 days before publicly disclosing.
* If I've had no response, or a 'will not fix' response, I will wait at least 60 days before publicly disclosing.
