hes gone for two weeks

plan:
  don't really know what's gonna happen w photometry yet
  maintain communication, easy w blog
  The next part of this project, since we've nearly finished photometry, is going to be bringing different parts together
  x ray is weird and already photometrized, would have to do astrometry not photometry
  split up data for each of us to do photometry on
  split up work for hr diagrams
  talk about what parameters to use
