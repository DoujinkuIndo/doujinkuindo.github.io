## [Fall 2020 Zoom Room](https://zoom.us/j/99025246009){:target="_blank"}

## Zoom Stream Expectations
- Questions are always welcome.
- When in doubt, mute your mic.
- Please turn video on during lecture time and breakout sessions.
- If the instructor misses something important in the comments, speak up!
- Lateness/Absence: please DM or text Tony _before_ you're already late/absent.

## Life Happens
You are expected to be present 8am-3pm each day but these are strange times. Your instructor will do their best to help you work around schedule conflicts, at-home distractions, etc. 

However, advanced notice will be appreciated when possible and it will be your responsibility to catch up on any missed material and obligations. Rely on your classmates and video recordings to help with this.

## Asking for a Sidebar
Sometimes it's difficult to find an opportunity to discuss something privately during a session. Either you or your instructor can ask for a "sidebar".

- Do NOT "private" message in Zoom (it's not actually private);
- Instead, DM Tony in Slack but keep in mind he might not notice it;
- If he doesn't respond, mention there's a DM waiting for him;
- If the discussion requires video/audio, schedule a time to meet over Slack.
