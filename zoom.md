[Fall 2020 Zoom Room](https://zoom.us/j/99025246009){:target="_blank"}

**Session starts promptly at 8am**

## Zoom Expectations
- Questions are always welcome.
- When in doubt, mute your mic.
- Please turn video on during breakout sessions.
- Video is optional (but is strongly encouraged) during lecture time.
- If the instructor misses something important in the comments, speak up!
- Lateness/Absence: please DM or text Tony _before_ you're already late/absent.

## Asking for a Sidebar
Sometimes it's difficult to find an opportunity to discuss something privately during a session. Either you or your instructor can ask for a "sidebar".

- Do NOT "private" message in Zoom (it's not actually private);
- Instead, DM Tony in Slack but keep in mind he might not notice it;
- If he doesn't respond, mention there's a DM waiting for him;
- If the discussion requires video/audio, schedule a time to meet over Slack.
