  <h1>Daily UI 042: ToDo List</h1>

  </figure>

  <p class="readable">Decided to go with a material design-based theme.. mobile is just more fun! I usually create site/app designs that are lighter in color as dark sites tend to be a bit more difficult for me. I'll be working on dark designs a bit more now.</p>

  <h1>Daily UI 040: Recipe</h1>

  <p class="readable">First and foremost, I took this recipe from the wonderful, <a href="https://www.chefsteps.com/">ChefSteps</a>. If you've been meaning to up your cooking game or just get inspired by creativity in cuisine, I definitely recommend checking it out! I played with the idea of recipe cards for this one.. something that was portable and convenient.</p>

  <h1>Daily UI 038: Calendar</h1>

  <figure>

  </figure>

  <p class="readable">This calendar was created whilst I was trying to create a new calendar for my RIT MyCourses redesign. I figured the calendar was too colorful for an academic site so I played with the design a little more as Daily UI allows for any sort of creativity!</p>
  
  <h1>Daily UI 002: Login Page</h1>
  
  <figure>
    <img class="dailyui" src="/images/login_dailyui.png" alt="Login Daily UI">
  </figure>
  
  <p class="readable">I created this login page a while ago when it was the Daily UI (last year). I decided to use it as a prototype design for an event called Blind By Design. BBD is an annual <a href="http://codeinthedark.com">Code in the Dark</a> inspired event hosted by the RIT web/app design & development club, Localhost. It was simple design with a few twists that could be a little tricky to code without any previewing in as little as 15 minutes!</p>
