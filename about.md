Hi, my name is Nicolas Fabre, and I started to get into programming in 2015 after finishing my master's degree in geograpy. It had a focus on statistics and cartography, so I started working with R, and got interested into web based cartography.

After starting self-teaching web development, I attended and graduated in 2017 from [WebForce3](http://www.wf3.fr/pret-a-tout-changer/developpeur-symfony), a coding bootcamp introducing to HTML, CSS, JS, OOP in PHP, Wordpress, SQL and Git.

After free-lancing for few month with the folks at [OhMyDevs!](https://www.ohmydevs.fr/equipe/), I decided to look for an experience in a company that would present me with new challenges to overcome.

I interned at [Boaterly](https://www.boaterfly.com/en) in 2017, to work on a boat rental marketplace web application. I learned about Ruby and Rails 3. I started to deploy fully tested, production ready code in an Agile environnement.

I then started to work there as a web developper in 2018, developping a search engine for boats on Rails 5 and React 16.

### More Information ℹ️

I like beautiful data visualisations, clean coding, project planning and everything outdoor 🌲
