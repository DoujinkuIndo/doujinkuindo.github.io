I am Director of Ecosystem at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io), part of the Linux Foundation.

I'm a software engineer by background; I enjoyed solving challenging problems at Google and startups. Now I advocate for and build communities around open source infrastructure.

I frequently speak, and also founded the [Cloud Native
London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London) for the community around Kubernetes and cloud native platform in London. You can find me, plus 200-300 techies, on the first Wednesday of every month.

## Background

Previously, I was a C++ engineer on Google Maps. I've been a product manager, DevOps engineering manager and developer advocate. I hold a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, King's College.
