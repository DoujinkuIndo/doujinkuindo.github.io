## Thanks for visiting!

My name is **Justin Murdock** and I am a card-carrying FAA Part 107 UAS Pilot. I know all the laws and regulations for flying drones and I am commercially licensed to fly unmanned aircraft. I can capture ultra-HD 4K 60FPS video recordings, and capture 48MP panoramic photos for landscape and real estate photography. I own a DJI Mavic Air 2 and love to take panoramic photos and cinematic videos with it. I live in beautiful North Idaho where there is so much natural beauty to film from the sky. I love filming cool stuff and being at cool events. I'm excited to share my experiences in the sky with you. This blog is where I post my content, as well as blog posts full of information and links to gear so that others may also take to the sky. Any product links on this website are affiliate links where I will earn a commission, and if you choose to use these links I will very much appreciate it.

### More Information

In the future as I pursue this career, I will have many different kinds of drones catered toward different goals. There is a style of flying drones where you wear VR goggles, and that is known as FPV (First-Person-View). Having an FPV drone will allow me to join and compete in the Drone Racing League, perform acrobatics while filming freestyle FPV, and begin capturing very exciting action footage for films and commercial advertisements.
