   Hi! I'm Enes. I live in İstanbul  and study computer engeneering in <a href="http://www.sakarya.edu.tr/tr">SAÜ</a> <i class="fa fa-book fa-lg"></i>.
   <br/>
   I'm really interested in software <i class="fa fa-keyboard-o fa-lg"></i> and everyday I'm trying to improve myself about it.
</p>
<p>
    I'm also interested in extreme sports.  For now I've tried <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mavikanatsakarya/?ref=ts&fref=ts">paragliding</a> and rock climbing.
    I want to do the others.

## Will continue

As long as I learn something new about software or something else about life worth spreading. I'll write them..

Thanks for reading!
