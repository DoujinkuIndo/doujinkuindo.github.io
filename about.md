### Introduction

First and foremost, I am an engineer, love building things. I currently happen to be working as a Machine Learning Engineer as it's awesome and I am good at it, but even when not working you could find me writing code, tweaking a circuit board, or building a city in a video game. I also read a lot of books and ride a motorcycle which I love talking about to anyone who would listen.

I come from a farming family and therefore believe in getting your hands dirty to achieve anything. Itâ€™s very important to do it yourself to be able to learn anything and that is one of my objectives through this website, both for its reader and myself.

I hope the content you find here is not a mere passive read but an active effort that prompts you to try it yourself or allows you to think deeper about topics. I have always found that engineers are some of the most helpful and resourceful individuals.

As the famous quote goes, <I>"standing on the shoulders of giants,"</I> engineers build upon the work of those who came before them to make remarkable advancements in their fields.
