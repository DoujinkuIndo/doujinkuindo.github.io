I am the Director of Ecosystem at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. My
mission is to to increase the adoption of Kubernetes and cloud native by growing the community and advocating for end users.

In addition to being a prolific public speaker, I founded the Cloud Native
London meetup. We are a strong, open, diverse developer community around the
cloud native platform and technologies in London. Each monthly event gets
200-300 attendees; [come join us in London on the first Wednesday of each
month](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London)!

## Background

Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, King's College.
