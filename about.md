I'm a classicist (PhD, ANU 2016)) interested in Greek and Latin scientific writing.  Before returning to humanities (which began of course with a brilliant Latin teacher in high school) I was a programmer and systems analyst in the Australian Public Service specialising in data architecture of large systems.
