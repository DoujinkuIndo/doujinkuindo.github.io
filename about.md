I am a graduate student in the [Institute for Machine Learning](http://www.ml.inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html). I work with Prof. [Joachim M. Buhmann](http://www.ml.inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=113456) and Prof. [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea).

I am interested in topics including continuous & combinatorial optimization, statistical learning and computer vision.
I like various sports, e.g., swimming, running, hiking & skiing.
