My name is Matt Boler and I'm a student at Auburn University, pursuing an Honor's BS in Mechanical Engineering with a Computer Science minor. I will be graduating in May 2019. I have professional experience in manufacturing engineering and hobby/competitive team experience in robotics and aerospace, mostly focused on programming and simulations. I spend most of my free time reading and taking online classes, both to expand on what I'm learning in my degree and to learn about anything that interests me. 

### Projects

* [Balancing Robot](https://github.com/mattboler/MECH3050_Balance)

### Self-Directed Learning

Classes I'm currently working through:

* [How to Code - Complex Data](https://github.com/mattboler/ComplexData)
* [Applications of Linear Algebra Part 2](https://github.com/mattboler/applications2)
* [Astrophysics X Series 1/4](https://github.com/mattboler/astro1x)

Classes I've finished or plan on taking in the future:

* [Computer Science](compsci.md)
* [Data Science](datasci.md)
* [Misc Science and Engineering](other_classes.md)
