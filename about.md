Hi, I'm Jeff!

### A quick summary of me!
I am a web developer. I grew up in New York City. My worst job ever was my highest paying ever: I was a revolting Wall St. trader. My best job ever: professional poker player... I learned so much about probability, software, data analysis, statistics, and game theory. I enjoy learning and will continue to learn.
