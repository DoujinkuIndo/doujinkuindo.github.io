I'm a Front-end web developer from Nottingham. Advocate of standards, simplicity, and performance.

[hello@martindm.uk](mailto:hello@martindm.uk)

## What I do
Currently Senior Front-end Developer with [@KainosSoftware](Kainos) working mostly alongside a team of brilliant Service and UX Designers at the [DVSA](https://dvsadigital.blog.gov.uk/) improving and maintaining the DVSA's MOT system.

I'm experienced with all stages of web project delivery from specification, UX reviews, design systems, digital prototyping and Javascript components.

Working with: HTML, CSS/SASS, Object Oriented Javascript, React, Webpack, PHP, npm, NodeJS and command line tools.

Passionate about the front-end, accessibility, and usability, I also have experience working with a Microsoft stack including Visual Studio and C# MVC environments, particularly Umbraco. I have been fortunate enough to work with talented colleagues, building solutions for clients as Post Office, Royal Mail, Pizza Hut and Argos.

### Typical tools
Our tools come and go, and so I like to have [proper understanding of the principles](https://medium.com/@martindimartinomarriott/as-developers-we-are-often-compelled-either-by-a-driving-curiosity-or-from-the-indifferent-b9430a76b3d1#.vz3xinux2) which underpin them foremost. If we can be great here, we can get to grips with any tool. Right now, I'm mostly using:

VS Code, Webpack, React, Wordpress.

### What else?
When not code mongering I'm usually [running around somewhere](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2986152/), [shredding the trails on my bike](https://www.instagram.com/martino_notts/), or bouldering. I love an open, communicative environment and making new connections with great designers and developers. Lover of philosophy and constant personal and technical development - we're forever students.
