###The Site
* Built with the [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) fork of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for simplicity and to satisfy my curiosity.
* Hosted on Git Hub - though [this reflects my relationship with Git](http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1597 "Mysterious Git").
