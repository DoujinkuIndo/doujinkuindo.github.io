## Mission
To better inform all actors in the [Municipal Solid Waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste) Stream system to help close the [loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy) for a sustainable society.

## About ZotBins
ZotBins is system of Smart Waste Bins with a suite of web-based applications to collect and analyze real-time waste data. Through IoT, ZotBins is able to use waste data to encourage zero waste practices from a behavioral approach while also demonstrating use of quantifiable data to improve waste systems holistically. This system has been able to help find useful waste related insights at the University of California, Irvine. To learn more visit https://zotbins.github.io or view our video:

## How it Started
In 2017, a team of undergraduate students at the University of California, joined a Hackathon hosted by [UCI TIPPERS](http://tippers.ics.uci.edu/) and created ZotBins to help make waste management more efficient while also encouraging more zero waste practices. With the guidance of professors and graduate students from the TIPPERS research group, the team was able to grow from 4 to over 15 individuals all working on the ZotBins project. Together they have been able to build and deploy a network of 9 smart bins on campus that are currently making a positive impact for UCI.

Owen Yang, who was one of the founders of ZotBins graduated from UCI and now with ZotBins Community Edition (ZBCE), he intends to further work with the new [ZotBins](https://zotbins.github.io) team to help further expand the concept of ZotBins where any city, business, university, classroom, or home could implement a smart waste system.

## ZBCE Team
This ZBCE project was initiated by [Owen Yang](https://okyang.github.io). It currently has a few people in the community and has a strong connection with the ZotBins team at UCI.
