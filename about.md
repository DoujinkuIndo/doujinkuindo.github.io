I’m an ex-Google engineer, now product manager at StorageOS, where I code, write and speak about storage, containers and cloud. I’m active in the developer community and regularly speak at meetups related to Docker containers, Kubernetes, microservices, cloud native and more.

I founded the [Cloud Native London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London/), the official Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) meetup group. It's dedicated to building a strong, open, diverse developer community around the Cloud Native platform and technologies in London.

## More information

I spent five years at Google writing C++ on teams across Google Maps, and lived in London and New York.

I hold a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge (King’s College). My final year dissertation was on [Gesture controlled robotics using the Vicon motion capture system](https://github.com/oicheryl/cambridge/blob/master/documentation/dissertation/cjh84.pdf)
