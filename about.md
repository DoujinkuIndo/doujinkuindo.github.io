Iâ€™m currently a postdoc at Harvard, as well as CTO at [Ghost Robotics](https://www.ghostrobotics.io/).

### More information

My [lab homepage](https://scholar.harvard.edu/avikde) has more information about the work I do.

Outside of lab (*...riiight*), I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee with [PADA](http://pada.org/), [fostering tiny kittens](/tags/#cats) and volunteering at [PAWS](http://phillypaws.org/). Please get in touch with me if you want to adopt a kitty friend!

I used to have pretty good (musical) keyboard chops (as much as you can without any formal music theory) and still have great [relative pitch](http://www.perfectpitch.com/perfectrelative.htm); I used to be decent at juggling (basic 3-ball patterns up to Mill's mess, 4-ball cascade on a good day), am drawn to [games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) that [require](http://www.popcap.com/bejeweled-blitz) rapid [pattern-matching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)), and enjoy [casual arting](/tags/#art).

### Travels

I have traveled a fair amount in my life (perk of being a graduate student :wink:) and I decided to start documenting, because it reminds of the stories involved.
