I am a last-year PhD student in Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie -- UPMC (Paris 6). My research interests cover nonparametric and/or high-dimensional statistics, first-order convex optimization, recommender system, differential privacy, adaptive data analysis... My thesis will point to a *distributed Frank-Wolfe framework for trace norm minimization*.
    
I have knowledge from various domains, among which mathematics, probability, statistics, machine learning, computer science and finance. I am currently looking for a *research* and/or *developer* job.
