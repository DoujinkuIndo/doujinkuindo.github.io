My name is Quan Nguyen.
I'm a software engineer and a machine learning engineer.
As a software engineer, I enjoy programming and learning new programming languages.
Currently, I'm into functional programming languages,
such as [Haskell](https://github.com/beekill95/cis_194_intro_to_haskell) and Purescript.
Later on, I might try learning other web technologies like WebGL, WebGPU, Wasm,
or new languages such as Rust, Go, Scheme, or Smalltalk.
As a machine learning engineer, I'm interested in
[Bayesian inference](https://github.com/beekill95/numpyro-doing-bayesian),
[computer vision](https://github.com/beekill95/east),
and [deep learning](https://github.com/beekill95/TC-Prediction).

I got my Master's degree at Indiana University Bloomington,
and my bachelor degree at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.

During my spare time,
I enjoy playing guitar and reading (sometimes).
