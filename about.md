Hey, I'm Matt MacIntyre&hellip; a front-end web developer from Nova Scotia.

I've been writing code in some capacity or another for nearly half of my life,  and I take pride in building usable, efficient websites. My experience allows me to bring modern, minimalist touches to the designs I translate from static layouts to interactive, communicative websites.

### What I do

Currently I make websites and solve problems full-time at **[VERB Interactive](http://verbinteractive.com)**.
They keep me pretty busy, but if you're interested in working with me independently and would like some hand-picked examples that I think may interest you and illustrate how I might be able to contribute to your project, please feel free to send me an [email](mailto:matt@thinkontheclock.com), or visit my [professional site](http://thinkontheclock.com) for more information.
