Hello! Thanks for visiting my blog. My name is Jason McDermott and though I studied music and visual arts
in college, somewhere along the way I (very happily) stumbled into programming. The name of this blog comes from a lyric I penned (a very long time ago, in a band all but forgotten) and I think it accurately sums up my approach to life and technology. I believe - or at least hope - we're all curious by nature, and therefore by design.

I am currently a Senior Software Developer at [Rightpoint Consulting](https://www.rightpoint.com/) and I should note that all opinions expressed on this site are mine alone and do not represent those of my employer.
