I am a keen cyclist, and member of [Dulwich Paragon Cycling Club](http://www.dulwichparagon.com/). You can view my cycling profile on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/julesjoseph).

I have been volunteering at my local [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) at Streatham Library. This is a network of national after school clubs, initiated by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/), which helps children (aged 9-13) learn how to code, using Scratch, Python and HTML.

Currently I am helping deliver surplus food to homeless charities with [Plan Zheroes](https://www.planzheroes.org/) - this is a fantastic organisation who collect food which would otherwise be thrown away and ensure it gets to people who really need it.

### More Information

I am a big fan of online/self-paced learning - in particular [PluralSight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/) and [A Cloud Guru](https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru)
