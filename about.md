### Me

Hey. I am a wana-be smart person.

### This blog

Yet another blog. I write here to organise my thoughts, to practice explanations and to explore ideas. 
If others happen to learn from these posts awesome!

The topics I will (probably) write about are machine learning and neural networks. Within that I am interested in;

* representation learning
* unsupervised and hebbian learning
* analysis of neural networks, why is NN1 better than NN2?
* learning hyper-parameters
* adapting morphology of neural networks
* convolution and signals
* explanations and occams razor
* learning how to learn and meta cognition 

So pretty much anything related to consciousness, learning and intelligence.
