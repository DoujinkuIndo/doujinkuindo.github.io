I live in Northen California. I studied biological science at undergraduate and software engineering at graduate school. I enjoy the thrill of solving computer problem. It is a combination of imagination and harnass computing power to turn ideas into actions. My passion in coding drive me to pursue a career in software engineering. 

Besides coding I enjoy cooking during my spare time particular cook "from scratch".

This sites record the progress of my goal of becoming a Software Engineer.
