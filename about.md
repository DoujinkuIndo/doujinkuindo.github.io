Hello! My name is Ailin. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in Biological Basis of Behavior, and currently work in nonprofit workforce development. 

I'm interested in learning programming to build accessible and intuitive tools for the greater good--in my definition, for artistic expression, the democratization of education, and maximizing the efficiency and impact of social good organziations. In this blog, I aim to document my programming journey.

My first experience programming was in high school where I fell in love with [Alice](https://www.alice.org), a simple block-based coding environment, which I used to animate elaborate surreal music videos. 

After I graduated college, I managed the website for the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation. I also became interested in creating Excel worksheets to streamline repetitive tasks like mail blasts and report generation. This hobby that followed me into my next position with the City of Philadelphia's workforce development board, Philadelphia Works, Inc. I noticed how many inefficiencies could be eliminated with a few well-designed tools, which even at the municipal level, there was a need for. I dove into creating guides and resources to help staff navigate our existing electronic record systems. At the same time I wondered what the backend of these systems looked like, and how I could build one of my own.
