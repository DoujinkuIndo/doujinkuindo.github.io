### Who Am I ?

Hey Bakar here! or as I am officially named "Muhammad Abdullah Abu Bakar"(Trust me it's a mouthful). I was born and raised in Pakistan, but currently in Istanbul till 2019. 
I am Budding Java EE Developer as working no Enterprise Software Development specifically with Spring(MVC/Security/Data) but generally I'm learning my ropes around the Enterprise *Javaverse*! 
Recently I've started to interact with multiple Open Source Projects and I must say I love it! Thank You Github <3  
I'm also quite fond of travelling and doing some amateur photography on my weekend strolls or day-to-day commuting. I hope to share some of my photos here soon! 
I'm quite fond of retro-technology from the 80's & 90's after find how the PS1 modchips worked! 
I consider myself a student of the stoic branch of philosophy as I read the works of Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius inorder to find the meaning of our Existence(if this is one?).
