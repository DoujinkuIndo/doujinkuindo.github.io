Hey there!

My name is Jeremy Novak. I'm a Software Engineer and IT Professional from Texas. 


I was a kid in the golden era of Arcade games. The Software Development and Game Design
worlds have a lot of legends and heroes. I am inspired by what people like [Yuji Naka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuji_Naka) were able to accomplish with truly limited hardware. 

When not at the keyboard I enjoy spending time with my dogs, working on my horsemanship,
playing [Disc Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf), and attempt some outdoor cooking. 


Thanks for visiting my GitHub.
