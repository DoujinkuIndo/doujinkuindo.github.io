I’m an audacious Petroleum Engineering junior at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, getting ready to fuel a better world.

Energy and Technology inspired me since childhood. I dreamt of harnessing perpetual energy until I studied thermodynamics. And once I dreamt of making a game-changing search engine. For me, the most gratifying aspect of technology is problem solving. It provides a medium to turn ideas into execution. 

My current interests include Reservoir Engineering and Data Analytics. I have taken a keen interest in learning about Reservoir Simulation and Machine Learning.

I spent my last summer building internet enabled circuits, making a Quadcopter fly and experimenting with vast variety of electronic sensor. Goal was to automate trivial things and explore its potential with regards to Oil & Gas Industry.

Right now I working on a research project based on Percolation Theory.

I’m seeking for a research or internship opportunity where I can apply myself and learn from the best.
