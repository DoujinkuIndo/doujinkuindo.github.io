I bring over a decade of experience writing and teaching to technical writing.

I'm excited about this new stage of my career.

I'm also a big reader. Did you know that the sci-fi writer Ted Chiang is also a tech writer? ☺️


### Some Places I've Lived

I grew up in South Dakota, attended college in DC, did study abroad programs in Florence and London, and have lived in New York City since 2008.
