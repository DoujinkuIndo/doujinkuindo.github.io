I'm a polglot programmer, software architect, distributed systems specialist and technology enthusiast. I like taking photographs, and while I wouldn't claim any particular photographic talent, I have some good photos captured over many years so I thought I'd share a few on my blog.

I've been mostly self employed as a consultant and contractor since 2004, and operate through [Deontik](http://deontik.com), a company that I share with [Zoran Milosevic](http://deontik.com/About/Zoran.html). We've done lots of things over those years, including a number of [research papers](http://deontik.com/Research/SelectedPapers.html) and also development of complex event processing applications using [EventSwarm](http://deontik.com/Products/EventSwarm.html), a Java library we created. 

I hope you like my writing and I'm happy to hear your thoughts, so feel free to comment on my articles directly or send email to [andyb@deontik.com](mailto:andyb@deontik.com).
