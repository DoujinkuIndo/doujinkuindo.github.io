I’m currently a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania.

### More information

My [lab homepage](http://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/Avik/Home) has more information about the work I do. Outside of lab *(...riiight)*, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee with [PADA](http://pada.org/), [fostering tiny kittens](/fosters) and volunteering at [PAWS](http://phillypaws.org/). Please get in touch with me if you want to adopt a kitty friend!

### Travels

I have traveled a fair amount in my life (perk of being a graduate student :wink:) and I decided to start documenting, because it reminds of the stories involved.

### Mini-resume

I'm pretty set on academia, but if you are someone who is looking to hire people and give them a big salary, maybe you want some of this info! (I realize that it's hip to have a Latex resume---but this is honestly way easier to keep up-to-date.)
