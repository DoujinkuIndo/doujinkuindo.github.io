Taylor J Hawkins has been providing IT consulting services to individuals and small businesses since 2007. He is currently contracted to Intel where he assists engineers with system integration analysis, producing technical documentation for various systems and test procedures, as well providing training and technical support. He also performs lab systems administration, project management, on-site event support, as well as demo evaluation and creation. Additionally, he has contributed to the development of internal software tools that are integrated into the production assembly process to support global events, such as Intel Extreme Masters (IEM). 

Taylor lives and works outside of Portland, Oregon where he can be found exploring the great outdoors via foot, boat, and bike. His interests are wide and varied, oftentimes adding complexity to his attempts at consistently juggling them. However, he somehow still finds time to contribute to a coding group, a small musical outfit, pursue literary endeavors, and dabble with his own DevOps and SysAdmin projects.
