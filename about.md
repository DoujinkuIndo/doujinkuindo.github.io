Hi there, my name is Matthew Bryce and I've just started a course at CodeClan. I'm using this blog to track everything tht happens and to help consolidate everything I learn during it.

### More Information

I've been working for the last 2 and a half years working as an IT Engineer. I decided to go for this course as I wanted to move towards using code for everything.
