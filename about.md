<img src="/images/headshot.jpeg" alt="Cheryl Hung, Director of CNCF" class="about-image"/>

I'm Director of Ecosystem at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, part of the Linux Foundation. I advocate for and build communities around Kubernetes, cloud native and open source infrastructure.

I founded Cloud Native London, the largest and most active cloud native meetup globally. You can meet me there, plus 200-300 techies, on the first Wednesday of every month.

Prior to the CNCF, I was a software engineer at Google London and New York. I've been a product manager, DevOps engineering manager and developer advocate.

I earned a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, King's College.

I am available for paid speaking opportunities, advisory and board roles.
