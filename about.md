### About Slasm

Slasm is a random word, don't give it any meaning, it deserves none. Back in September of 2012 I found a domain name generator that created a random word based on individual letters. I would link to it now, but it's not really working (it still generates strings, but it does not check to see if the domain is available) and I choose not to call them out.

I chose to generate random words based on something like C + C + V + C + C, or L + L + V + L + L, or some combination thereof where C = consonant, V = vowel and L = letter.

So, thatâ€™s slasm, no more, no less.
