I am a software developer and architect who currently works in the field of medical imaging. I have a PhD in physics and an active interest in Systems Programming, Mathematics, and Optics. The blog posts are my personal notes while exploring the subjects I am interested in. It is me explaining to myself as I learn.

Hopefully, whoever stumbles across the posts finds it helpful to watch me discover knowledge rather than teach things I already know.
