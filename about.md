I am an experienced researcher and a amateaur Data Scientist trying to answer some of the most puzzling questions in Biology to address human health and disease. 

I was born in Jamui - a small town in India. My early education was from DAV Public School Jamui. I completed my undergrad studies in 2015 from IIT Kanpur, India, with a major in Bioeingineering. During my undergrad studies, I got an initial exposure to research while doing a short 3-month internship in the lab of Dr. Detlef Weigel at Max-Plansk Institute for Biology, Tubingen, Germany. In Dr. Weigel's lab, I learnt **NGS** and **Gel Electrophoresis** to sequence the circular RNA in _Arabidopsis Thaliana_. Cirucar RNA are an addition to the growing list of non-coding RNA with potential role in regulating gene expression. Also, I did my B.Tech project in the lab of Dr. Nitin Gupta (Bioinformatics Group, BSBE), IIT Kanpur. I used bioinformatics tools and python programming to understand the olfactory sensing mechanism in _Drosophila_ (fruit fly).

Fascinated by the irresistible nature of research to explore something new and innovative, I opted to go for higher studies. In Fall 2015, I moved to Canada to pursue my doctoral studies from Simon Fraser University (SFU). During my PhD, I accomplished 5 independent projects spanning the area of Cancer genomics, immunology, neurodegenerative disorders, DNA nanotechnology, _in-silico_ simulations and DNA/RNA catalysis which yielded 6 peer-reviewed journal publications, 11 oral/poster presentations and >10 awards/Fellowships. 

Upon graduation, I worked in a Vancouver based biotech company "Flextrapower Technologies" as a Research Scientis for six months.
