#### History
I bought scottshapiro.com in my freshman year of college, 2000. Internic lost their monopoly, and one could now buy a domain for a fraction of the cost. A seventeen year old, I took out my brand new credit card and made what felt like a big purchase. I had not used this domain for much beyond a Counter-Strike server and a photo album (all pre-2004). 

I had a blog on here in 2009, but it’s now in legacy WordPress purgatory. I restarted a blog in 2017 on Wordpress. I moved it to Jekyll on Github Pages in 2019.

Many other Scott Shapiros have inquired about this domain, but I’ve held on to it. If you’re one of them, join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/thescottshapiros/?ref=share).
