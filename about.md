### Me

Hey. I am a wana-be smart person.

### This blog

This is a selfish blog. I write here to organise my thoughts, to practice explanations and to explore ideas. 
If others happen to learn from these posts awesome!

The topics I will (probably) write about are machine learning and neural networks. Within that I am interested in;

* representation learning
* unsupervised and hebbian learning
* the complexity of neural networks and occams razor
* hyper-parameter learning and adapting morphology of neural networks
* convolution and signals
* and other stuff?
