### About Me

Hi, my name is **Susanna Dong**! I'm a software engineer currently based off of New York City.

Some random things that I enjoy doing:
* Learning of all sorts of knowledge.
* Walking and hiking, especially through nature.
* Games of many sorts - tabletop and video!
* Illustrations and worldbuilding.
* Food, lots of food.

### About War(un)lock

Before leaving my last job, I told folks that I would take a gap year off. Many folks asked if I was going to record my experiences. I caved in and finally set up a blog!

The title "War(un)lock" combines my nerdom of Dungeons & Dragons, my tendency to dig into etymology, and my strong urge for self-improvement. (Ironically, warlocks are one of my least favorite D&D classes. Don't @ me.)

The goal of the blog is mostly based on experiences from my gap year. This blog's content may range from travel, things I've learned over the past few weeks, my thoughts splattered into text or drawings, and whatever comes to mind.

### About GitHub Pages

I've asked some of my fellow colleagues on what sort of tech stack they've used to power their blogs. I've also considered creating my own static website through AWS or GCP. In the end, I settled with GitHub Pages because:
* It saved me from creating another online account, as I already had a personal GitHub account.
* GitHub Pages has free hosting and HTTPS support, while offering flexibility with Markdown content and Jekyll static site generation.
* This blog hosting gave me vibes of the early 2000's, where the internet was still indie and experimental and quirky.
