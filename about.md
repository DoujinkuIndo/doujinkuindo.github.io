I'm a 27 year old swede currently in my last year at the Master Programme in Statistics at Uppsala University, Sweden.

### Interests and content

I'm interested in most kinds of data analysis and visualization (even though I can be a lot better at it). Posts here will include my humble tries at kaggle competitions, a lot of sports analysis and other fun stuff.
