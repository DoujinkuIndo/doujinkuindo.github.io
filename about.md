Redouane Lguensat was born in Casablanca, Morocco in 1991. He received both an Engineering degree in information processing systems from Télécom Bretagne, France, and a Master of research in image processing at Rennes I university, France, in 2014. He is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in Information Sciences & Technologies, and is working under Prof. Ronan Fablet (IMT Atlantique) and Dr. Pierre Ailliot (University of Western Brittany) and Dr. Bertrand Chapron (Ifremer) on spatio-temporal data-driven interpolation (inpainting) of noncomplete image sequences. Methods he works on are mainly based on stochastic filtering and he investigates the possibilty of using analog forecasting methods for complex data such as Sea Surface Temperature.

His research interests include signal and image processing, data-driven methods, inverse problems, machine learning, data assimilation and optimization.
