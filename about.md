### Introduction

First and foremost I am a programmer and an engineer at heart, even when I am not working I keep writing code, it is my idea of having a good time. Since I can remember I have been obsessed with building stuff, taking a blank sheet creating something useful from it. Coming from a farming family I understand the value of hard labor and doing things by your hand, it gives me a sense of fulfillment, there is freedom in doing things yourself and getting your hands dirty. Machine learning is my current passion and I strongly believe it will be a game-changer for the next generation of products, and I want to be in the front seat when it happens. I am also an avid gamer and a book warm, therefore you would also find a whole bunch of blogs on the those topics as well.
