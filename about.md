Ken Sobieski started developing spaghetti in BASIC on a RSTS machine from 1983 - 1986. He fell out of coding until 1995 when he got dragged into developing a Microsoft Access-based inventory tracking system. From there it was a just a matter of time before jumping to SQL Server and VB6. With the Dawn of .Net, VB.Net followed where he lived until starting coding C# in earnest when joining Quicken Loans in 2012.

Somewhere between BASIC and C# he has been a security guard, bartender, production and inventory control specialist, and longshoreman. He's also done tour support for a band, as well as spending 9 years as a technology consultant doing everything from pulling cable --> Windows network administration --> Web development.

Originally from Long Beach, CA, he he relocated to the most amazing city in the world, Detroit, MI in 2011. Though firmly settled in Detroit, he is still a long-time fan of the L.A. Kings, Lakers, Dodgers, Angels, and Galaxy(but will happily cheer on the Wings, Tigers and Pistons as long as they aren't playing a team from L.A.). 

Now that the Raiders have moved to Las Vegas, he is officially a Lions fan.
