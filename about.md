Hi, I'm Alex, I'm a data scientist.  Before data science, I was a mathematician, a dish washer, a bicycle activist, an account manager, and a lot of other things.  I've been a competitive runner for 22 years, and I love my girlfriend Heidi, my cat Gizmo, and my family!

## Data Science:

I'm just getting started in data science, and as such, I work to improve my technical skills every day.  I have a background in math (UCLA, PhD, 2008), data analysis, and account management, all of which aid me greatly in data science.  My career in data science took off when I attended [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/){:target="_blank"}, and graduated as one of just 46 fellows admitted of 1807 applicants to the Fall 2015 cohort.

Here are some of my technical strengths:

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- SQL
- ML basics (linear and logistic regression, k-means, knn, etc)

These are some technologies and areas I've acquired some skill in, and I'm plan to continue learning about:

- Bokeh
- Plot.ly with Python
- Flask
- Heroku
- Apache Spark
- Scala
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/){:target="_blank"} (currently I've solved 29 problems, both the Project Euler versions and the more computationally challenging versions on HackerRank)
- MapReduce
- more ML

And here are some technologies and topics I aspire to learn about, but know very little!

- C
- [Spark + H2O (Sparkling Water!)](http://www.h2o.ai/product/sparkling-water/){:target="_blank"}
- D3.js
- TDD in Python
- Formal mathematical formulations of ML
- Deep Learning
- and Mihai tells me I should learn **Node.js**

I like to learn and learn and learn, so I expect to keep adding to this list!
