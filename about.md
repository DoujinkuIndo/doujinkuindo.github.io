I'm a Front-end web developer from Nottingham. Advocate of standards, simplicity, and performance.

[martinonotts@gmail.com](mailto:martinonotts@gmail.com)

## What I do
I'm experienced with all stages of web project delivery from specification, UX reviews, digital prototyping to responsive front-end builds and Javascript functionality.

Working with: HTML, CSS/SASS, Object Oriented Javascript, jQuery, PHP, npm, NodeJS and command line tools.

Passionate about the front-end and usability, I also have experience working with a Microsoft stack including Visual Studio and C# MVC environments, particularly Umbraco. I have been fortunate enough to work with talented colleagues, building solutions for clients as Post Office, Royal Mail, Pizza Hut and Argos.

### Typical tools
Our tools come and go, and so I like to have [proper understanding of the principles](https://medium.com/@martindimartinomarriott/as-developers-we-are-often-compelled-either-by-a-driving-curiosity-or-from-the-indifferent-b9430a76b3d1#.vz3xinux2) which underpin them foremost. If we can be great here, we can get to grips with any tool. Right now, I'm mostly using:

Visual Studio, AWS, Wordpress, NodeJS, Gulp, Sourcetree, Wordpress, Umbraco and Jekyll.

### What else?
When not code mongering I'm usually [running around somewhere](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2986152/), [shredding the trails on my bike](https://www.instagram.com/martino_notts/), or doing Krav Maga. I love an open, communicative environment and making new connections with great designers and developers. Lover of philosophy and constant personal and technical development - we're forever students!
