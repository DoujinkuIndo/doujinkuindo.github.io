I'm a Swedish student at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm studying towards a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering (quite a mouthul).

### Really? Is that all you are?

No, I also spend most of my spare time as a treasurer in the Social Democratic Youth League chapter in Stockholm, together with some organizational positions in the Social Democrats. I'm also an elected official in my municipality of Botkyrka!

Whatever time remains is spent geeking out about languages. A lot of my projects center around NLP, and it's also the "major" of my masters programme (data science and language technology). I'm also working on improving my Persian language skills, which is my second mother tongue after Swedish.
