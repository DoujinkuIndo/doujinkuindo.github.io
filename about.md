I am a 23 year old Statistics student currently residing in Cape Town, South Africa. 
I believe that our generation's struggle is the decolonial struggle, working to undo complex systems of oppression which dictate nearly every aspect of our lives. 
As a cis-gendered, middle-class, white, heterosexual man, I was not required to engage on the intersections between my privilege and others' oppression until adulthood.
That paradigm can no longer exist, and must be systematically disrupted.
All oppressions must fall.

Over the past years studying Statistics, I have noticed that the discipline seems to think itself immune from engaging on these types of moral issues because as a science it is "objective." 
In fact, the history of Statistics is far from ethically neutral. 
Similarly, Statistical techniques and algorithms are currently being used in equally dubious ways, perhaps because users are not taught to think critically about their position in the world, or the history of the problems they are trying to solve.
This blog is an attempt to fill a gap in the decolonization discussion, as it relates to Statistical Sciences.

### More Information

I am currently finishing my Honours degree in Statistical Sciences at the University of Cape Town. 
I am passionate about Statistics, Data Visualization and Social Equity, not in any particular order.
