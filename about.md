I'm a computer engineer from Montreal, Canada. I enjoy working with open source projects for all sorts of things. I'm also a hardcore GNU/Linux fan.

I enjoy doing tons of different stuff: cycling, system administration, competitive gaming (mainly dota2/starcraft II related stuff), reading, otaku-related activities etc.
