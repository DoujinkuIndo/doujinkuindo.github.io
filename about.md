Welcome to my website! I am a mechanical engineer and graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by the [Microsystems and Mechanobiology Lab](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bex/news/) and the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php/). My research is in building microswimmers which have potential uses in medicine, biology and chemistry. 

(You can read my old website [here](http://benjaminsonemma9.wixsite.com/starshiptoadventure/). It was fun to write but I prefer using Github and Jekyll, instead of Wix.
