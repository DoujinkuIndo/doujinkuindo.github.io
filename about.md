Hi there, my name is Matthew Bryce and I’ve just started a course at CodeClan. I have created this blog to record and consolidate everything I learn.

### More Information

I’ve been working for the last 2 and a half years as an IT Engineer. I decided to apply for this course, as I wanted to improve my coding skills, in order to become a web developer.
