ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Shenghao's here.

I'm a data scientist, an amateur photographer, and a chess fan. I write about my journey of exploring the world of data science and technology. Some fun facts about me

* In my hometown, I have chance to experience a 50Â°C temperature difference between indoor and outdoor, during winter, of course.
* Right now I stay at a place where I can see a plane flying over my head every half an hour.
