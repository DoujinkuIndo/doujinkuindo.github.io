I’m currently a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. This space will have more things in the future.

### More information

My [lab homepage](http://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/Avik/Home) has more information about the work I do. Outside of lab *(...riiight)*, I enjoy staying playing ultimate frisbee with [PADA](http://pada.org/), fostering tiny kittens and volunteering at [PAWS](http://phillypaws.org/). Please get in touch with me if you want to adopt a kitty friend!

### Mini-resume

I realize that it's hip to have a Latex resume---but this is honestly way easier to keep up-to-date.
