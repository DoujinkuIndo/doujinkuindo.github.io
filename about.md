Hi! I'm Raj, originally from India. I just finished M.Sc. in Media Informatics from RWTH Aachen University, Germany.
My field of interest during my course of study is Machine Learning. 

Right now, I'm working as a software developer in [Quintly](https://www.quintly.com/). The primary focus of my work
is to apply the skills I have acquired in developing interesting features.


The main intention behind this blog is to deepen my understanding of the subject, improve my writing skills and 
also to share my knowledge with people in my circle.
