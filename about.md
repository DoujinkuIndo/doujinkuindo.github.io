#### History
I bought scottshapiro.com in my freshman year of college, 2000. Internic lost their monopoly, and one could now buy a domain for a fraction of the cost. A seventeen year old, I took out my brand new credit card and made what felt like a big purchase. I haven’t used this domain for much beyond a Counter-Strike server and a photo album (all pre-2004). I had a blog on here in 2009, but it’s now in legacy WordPress purgatory.

Many other Scott Shapiros have inquired about this domain, but I’ve held on to it. If you’re one of them, join our Facebook group!
