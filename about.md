### About Me

I'm a father of 4 great kids, husband to the most amazing woman in the world, and overall geek. I'm a web developer by day, and freelance in the toy and game industry by night.

### About A Pawn's Perspective

I've been a contributor at [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com) since October 2009. Through the years I've gone from a contributor to an Editor, and met many amazing people and seen lots of amazing things along the way. Over various conventions throughout the years I've stumbled upon some really good things that don't always fit on Purple Pawn, so I've had to tuck them away or push them aside. I've also met some really interesting individuals, people who's passion and creativity amaze me. I've finally decided to create a place share those things, and spotlight those people.

Over time the writers at Purple Pawn have started referring to ourselves as Pawns. A Pawn's Perspective is my personal take on the world of tabletop gaming, toys, and digital gaming that I surround myself in. While I post mostly tabletop news and reviews on Purple Pawn, here I'll be posting personal insights, game unboxings, interviews, digital game streaming, varied reviews, and much more. It's by no means a replacement to my writing on Purple Pawn, but a supplement. A place to share, what I hope is, really cool stuff.
