I am a keen cyclist, and member of [Dulwich Paragon Cycling Club](http://www.dulwichparagon.com/). You can view my cycling profile on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/julesjoseph).

I have been volunteering at my local [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) at Streatham Library. This is a network of national after school clubs, initiated by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/), which helps children (aged 9-13) learn how to code, using Scratch, Python and HTML.

### More Information

I am a big fan on online/self-paced learning - in particular [PluralSight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/).
