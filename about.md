My name is Gianluca and I'm a Data Scientist. I live in New York, although I spent almost 6 years in the rainy London.

If I had to describe myself, I would say I'm quite a sociable person. I like to go out with friends for the occasional brunch or beer after work. I also love coffee, food and ice hockey.

I have a profound passion for learning. It might sound like a cliche, but I truly love maths, statistics, programming, and, generally speaking, solving real-world problems using those skills.

### More Information

When I'm not either working or studying, I go out with friends, binge watch Netflix ― who doesn't!? :-) ― and work out. I love triathlon and have completed a number of Olympic distance races over the years.

### Why am I blogging?

The reason why I'm blogging is that I want to share my experience in Data Science. While doing it, I hope to consolidate such concepts in my memory and, hopefully, connect with some likeminded person.
