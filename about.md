This is the website & blog of Nic Lake, a 30-something tech enthusist, gamer & streamer, musician, sports fan, home brewer & craft beer snob, husband, and cat dad living in Des Moines, IA.

I spend my days working as a business analyst on an augmented & virtual reality team for a major manufacturing company. Previously, I've also worked as a software developer for industry leaders in healthcare, non-profit fundraising, insurance, banking, and public transportation.

I spend my nights and weekends partaking in a variety of hobbies. Video games are a major passion of mine, and you can find me [streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/PhoenixUNI) on occasion. I'm always looking for additional games to add to my [never-ending list of games to play](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zg-SOYI8DlH-ibSNslfPtq0xJB4sEMb_7OHKbq2qclk/edit?usp=sharing). I'm also a multi-instrumental musician, and I've [released an EP under the name *The Music Plays You*](http://themusicplaysyou.bandcamp.com).

This website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
