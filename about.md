### Information

I am a data-savvy person who finds joy in helping others understand the language of numbers. I have been working as a data analyst for three years. But I find the title "data analyst" as too narrow to cover all the things and tasks that I do. Therefore, I prefer to say that in my job **I am making data useful**.
