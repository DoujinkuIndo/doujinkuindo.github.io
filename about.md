I am a creative & analytic thinker with a background in Mathematical Finance, who is looking to join a Data Science team after dedicating several years to raise my family. I am looking to combine advanced data analytics, machine learning and mathematical skills to solve complex problems.

### More Information

I finished a 12 week data science bootcamp with Metis recently during which I completed 5 projects analyzing topics such as MTA commuters, box office profits, home loan predictions, and built a text translator (between languages). Through these projects I enjoyed becoming comfortable with technologies for data acquisition, data management, statistical analysis, and data visualization.
