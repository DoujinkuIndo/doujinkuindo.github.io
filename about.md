We develop innovative, open source, data science and data visualization tools. In our blog, we share a little about who we are, how we work, the problems we are trying to solve, and the types of tools we're developing. 

### More Information
We work at [Rho](http://www.rhoworld.com/rho/), a full-service Clinical Research Organization with a mission to improve health, extend life, and enhance the quality of life via corporate and research excellence.

We started as a Data Visualization team in 2014, primarily focused on web-based statistical graphics. Data viz is still central to much of our work, but over time we have evolved into a broader, multi-disciplinary Data Science team.

We have a large and ever-growing library of open source tools available on [our GitHub site](https://github.com/RhoInc).

### Contact us

If you have a question or want to connect with someone on our team, you can email us at [graphics@rhoworld.com](mailto:graphics@rhoworld.com).

If you have feedback on a specific tool in our library, you are welcome to collaborate with us directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/RhoInc).
