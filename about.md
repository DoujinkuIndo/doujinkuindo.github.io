### About 

            <p>My name is Ezequiel (Ezekiel), I'm a Mobile Developer (iOS) with expertise in electronics, embedded systems, robotics, instrumentation, industrial automation, industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT).
            During the product development cycle I focus on the user experience, in the information architecture that will be available and in the ergonomics and usability of the system. I Worked in a lot of multidisciplinary projects.
            I am enthusiastic about innovation and creation processes that is the reason I love to attend entrepreneurship marathons and hackathons. I have attended AngelHack SP, Globo Hackathon, Startup Weekend Maker, Masters of Code SP, Campus Party Hackathons and many others.
