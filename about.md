### Interests

Aside of my _regular_ job as researcher I am interested in deep learning, self-driving cars and software development in general.

### Motivation

I am happy to transfer my knowledge (and enthusiasm) back to the community so that others won't make the same mistakes that I did when I started.
Here, community includes not only other (under)graduate students, but also interested teenagers.
I believe that all problems can be explained in a way almost everyone can understand them.
