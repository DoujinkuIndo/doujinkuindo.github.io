I am a PhD student in the Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD. I think about language and communication and how it is possible to use the former to do the latter despite uncertainty at every level. I have background in cognitive science, computer science, neuroscience, philosophy, lingusitics, mathematics, and artificial intelligence, and I try to bring all of these tools and perspectives to bear on this question.

### More Information

I also spend time thinging about more traditional epistemological and metaphysical problems as well as what some might consider to be more practical issues.
