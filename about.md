My deepest fantasy is to sit in a time machine and go back in time so I can educate my younger self and help him avert the painful mistakes I have made.

Since I cannot do that, I shall do the next best thing. Write a blog where each post is secretly addressed to my younger self. Sometimes, they are addressed to the 15 year old me. Other times, they are meant for the me from 5 years ago or 10 years ago. Perhaps, even the odd one or two addressed for the me from 5 minutes before.
