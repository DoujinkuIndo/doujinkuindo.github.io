Hello friend (I hope)!

My name is MikaÃ«l Gramont, originally from France. I go by Mika in the US, as it's nicer to my ears :p

I'm a frontend developer, currently working at YouTube in San Bruno, CA. There are many titles out there for what I do: web developer, front-end engineer, UX engineer, etc. Some might say I push pixels around, but those are haters. I like to think that I build high-quality, robust user interfaces, in line with today's standards.

Okay I push pixels around, fine.

### Some background

As this site is mostly out there for my web work, you probably don't care all that much about what I like to do on the weekends or when nobody else is watching (no, not like that!). Doesn't matter, let me bore you anyway!

My biggest thing is mountainboarding. Mountainboarding is a mashup of skateboarding, snowboarding and mountainbiking: you strap yourself to a board with big pneumatic wheels and you go down grassy hills, mountain trails, dirt jumps, skateparks, you name it. It's a pretty obscure sport, I'll give you that, but the cool thing with it is the community. I have mountainboarding friends all around the globe, and it's really fun to meet all kinds of people who are so different, yet share the same passion.

Mountainboarding has done a lot for me. It's the reason why I got into web development in the first place: I setup the [first mountainboard community website](http://www.amtbzone.com) in France around 2002. At the time I was a student in electrical engineering and all that database crap bore me pretty bad, but nobody else was going to do it, so I did.

After a while I started enjoying it a whole lot more, and rebuild that site as [www.mountainboard.fr](http://www.mountainboard.fr) (a little outdated now, I'm hoping to respons-ify it soon). I learned so much! In the meantime, I spent a few years as a consultant in the automotive industry (not my thing, really), but thanks to my experience, managed to get a job as a web developer with a startup in Toulouse.

If not for mountainboarding, I have no idea what kind of job I'd have today.

### The rest

I also like to snowboard, surf and skateboard a bit. People have told me that that's all the same thing. Is it? I don't see it that way :)

Perhaps talking about how I like photography and have some interest in design would make me sound a little less one-sided, but I'm afraid to sound like a hipster now. I will say, though, that you will never find me in line at Starbucks!
