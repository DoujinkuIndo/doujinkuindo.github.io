HI! I'm MomoDeve, a student who love Computer Science, Software Engineering and GameDev

# More about me

I've been programming C++ and C# for around three years, mainly working on [MxEngine](https://github.com/asc-community/MxEngine) game engine during the last year. My previous experience also include my own programming language - [MSL](https://github.com/MomoDeve/MSL) (bison parser + custom bytecode + own VM), mono runtime binder for C++ - [monobind](https://github.com/asc-community/monobind) and logic circuit simulator [Electronics](https://github.com/MomoDeve/Electronics) created for my school IT classes. I am member of [ASC community](https://github.com/asc-community) and help to develop other cool open-source projects, like [AngouriMath](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath) (symbolic math engine in C#).
