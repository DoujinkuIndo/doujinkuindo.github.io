Hey, I'm Matt MacIntyre&hellip; a front-end web developer from Nova Scotia.

I've been writing code in some capacity or another for nearly half of my life,  and I take pride in building usable, efficient websites. My experience allows me to bring modern, minimalist touches to the designs I translate from static layouts to interactive, communicative websites.

### What I do

Primarily, my strengths are HTML, CSS, jQuery and custom Wordpress theme development, including responsive and adaptive layouts. However, I love to write and to learn, and can often be found temporarily breaking my computer experimenting with something new.

If you're interested in working with me independently, and would like some hand-picked examples that I think may interest you and illustrate how I might be able to contribute to your project, please feel free to send me an [email](mailto:matt@thinkontheclock.com).

Over the years I've worked on a large number of projects, both personal and professional. If you'd like to look at a good chunk of the sites I've worked on in a professional capacity (mostly WordPress, static sites templated with PHP, web design, and content architecture), please take a look [here](http://highlandmultimedia.com/portfolio/).

I also helped start and am the front-end developer [here](http://rentgorilla.ca).
