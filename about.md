I'm a software engineer, primarily working with Java. I am a massive advocate of clean code, TDD and monitoring. 

### More Information

Some personal information for whoever is interested. I was born in London, grew up in a small island called Cyprus when my love for software engineering started to become apparent and then moved to Manchester and studied Software Engineering. I worked in Manchester for a while and then moved to London and my current job.
