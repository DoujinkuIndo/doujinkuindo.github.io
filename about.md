    <ul>
      <li>⌛ Over the last 5 years I have focused on Data Science and Machine Learning, building on a foundation of 9 years of experience in Software Engineering. <br/>
        I have worked, <i>and played</i>, with programming stacks and technologies from microcontrollers through mobile and web app development to cloud systems.</li>
      <li>👨‍💻 I currently work as an Engineer building cool stuff @<a href="https://hence.ai/">Hence.ai</a></li>
      <li>💞 <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/KayO/WebsiteImageSafetyAnalyzer">This</a> is my latest pet project. It's a POC for an AI tool to protect kids online and make sure they don't stumble across unwholesome content. It uses Computer Vision to assess website safety for kids (More CV cases and additional NLP work will follow soon).<br/>
      I’m looking to collaborate on projects geared towards making the internet safer for kids. ☺️</li>

In case you're interested, I run two other blogs with different focus points:
- [Chopbox Life](https://chopboxlife.com/): A fictional blog based just in part on my life in high school
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@kayogh): My Medium blog is dedicated to things that are a little more real and have to do with life
