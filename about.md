My name is Matt Boler and I'm a student at Auburn University, pursuing an Honor's BS in Mechanical Engineering with a Computer Science minor. I will be graduating in May 2019. I have professional experience in manufacturing engineering and hobby/competitive team experience in robotics and aerospace, mostly focused on programming and simulations. I spend most of my free time reading and taking online classes, both to expand on what I'm learning in my degree and to learn about anything that interests me. 

### Projects

- [Balancing Robot](https://github.com/mattboler/MECH3050_Balance)
- [Laser Tracking Robot (current project)](https://github.com/mattboler/Eye-Lasering)

### Self-Directed Learning

Classes and books I'm working through:

- [How to Code - Complex Data](https://github.com/mattboler/ComplexData)
- [Fundamentals of Robotics](https://github.com/mattboler/RoboticsFundamentals)
- [Modern C](https://github.com/mattboler/ModernC)

Repositories for other classes I am either taking or have already finished can be found on my [github](https://github.com/mattboler).
