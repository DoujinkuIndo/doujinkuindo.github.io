*Hi there,*

I'm a passionate backend developer with a keen interest in DevOps and all thing automated, which will hopefully come across in the projects.
Aside from tech, my other interests include any activity that keeps me moving (Bonus points if adrenaline is involved), these include, *but are not limited to*,
Mountain Biking, Skiing and Badminton.

*Thanks, Matt*
