**Approximate Inference and Information Bottleneck for Deep Neural Network**
>I don't want to represent my exact function and its every details and I actually cannot. Instead, I need an *compact* approximate of my function for specific tasks. In the same manner, I do not want to represent my data precisely with all its every details and redundance, I want a compact yet sufficiently informative representation for a task at hand.
