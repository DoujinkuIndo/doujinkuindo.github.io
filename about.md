I am the Director of Ecosystem at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. I speak frequently at meetups and conferences on container and cloud native technologies.

I founded the [Cloud Native London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London), dedicated to building a strong, open, diverse developer community around the cloud native platform and technologies in London. We have 200-300 monthly attendees; come join us in London on the first Tuesday of each month!
