Hello! I am a designer working in the Mid-Atlantic region. I specialize in conceptual and editorial design. My expertise extends to brand management, advertising and social media â€“ with an emphasis in non-profit and educational industries. 

I'm working on migrating two sites to this space. Stay tuned!
