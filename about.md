### Hi there!

Are you a technology enthusiast? Do you like testing new ideas? Are you a maker? If so, this blog is for you.

Let me make this clear, this isn’t a blog to review new phones nor to comment about big tech firms (well, they might be cynically mentioned but that isn’t my focus). This blog is my journey to explore the world of new technologies, my learning to create things with electronic pulses and my quest to push my own boundary.

So friends, here, you will find my blog posts on Raspberry Pi alongside the newest ideas I’m testing, my take on data analysis, and occasionally weird ideas, which I’ll try to keep it less weird as possible. It’d be great to find friends with the same interest. If you like what I wrote (or even if you don’t like what I wrote), drop me an email at [lbhtran@gmail.com](mailto:lbhtran@gmail.com). I love to get emails from people other than advertisements and TfL notifications once in a while.

Have I mentioned that I wrote a dissertation on Mutually Orthogonal Latin Square? To some of you, they may be a combination of randomly generated words but to others, you may feel intrigued. It’s a paper about combinatorial maths. Did I lose most of my audience now? Scroll down to skip this boring part. Or if you want to help find the answer to a 400-year mathematical question, read my paper [here](https://github.com/lbhtran/mols/blob/master/download/Simplified3MOLS10.pdf). The question is still opened to all.

If you are a nice person and don’t find anything I wrote up there interesting but you still read on to this point because you’re such a nice person (or maybe you think this About Me page is my subtle way to ask for help as I’m kidnapped and locked away in a basement of some creepy dude but somehow I’m still managed to get access to the Internet to make this website), I have nice photos for you. Head to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/alexflewoverthecuckoonest) for your daily intake of squared photos and hashtags or my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/149188285@N06/albums) gallery if you’re into something more sophisticated.

That’s all about me I guess. Ah, I’m Vietnamese. If you want to read my thoughts in another language, go to [Alex flew over the cuckoo nest](https://alexflewoverthecuckoonest.wordpress.com/). It’s my (more) personal blog about films and travelling that I tried to keep in Vietnamese so I don't forget my mothertongue.

I can’t think of anything else now. Let me know about you then. Drop me and email, leave some comments on my posts or say hi on any of my social channels.
