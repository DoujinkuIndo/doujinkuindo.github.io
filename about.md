I'm a computer engineer from Montreal, Canada. I enjoy working with open source projects for all sorts of things. I'm also a hardcore GNU/Linux fan.

I enjoy doing tons of different stuff: cycling, system administration, competitive gaming (mainly dota2/starcraft II related stuff), reading, otaku-related activities etc.

### More Information

I was born in a rural region, where high-speed Internet didn't even make it until 2012, and even then, it was based on microwaves and antennas so rainy/cloudy days hindered the signal a lot. I never thought I'd end up in the city being a software developer, as I've spent the biggest part of my childhood playing outside and not tinkering with computers.
