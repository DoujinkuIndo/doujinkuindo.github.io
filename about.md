#Currently I am

Looking for my first job in software development.


#Background 

  I've been at Adelphi since the Fall of 2012, and I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics in the Spring of 2016. I wrote my first lines of code in my second semester of college, in Racket.  I didn't really know what I was doing, but I had a good time doing it and did well in the class.  I declared the Computer Science major and enrolled in the appropriate freshman level classes for the next fall, where we mostly used Java.  I continued to enjoy programming both in class and during my free time, and also picked up an interest and a major in Mathematics. In addition to all of my coursework, I've completed side projects using Android, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and more, all of which are open source on my [Github profile](https://github.com/michaelvessia). I'm hoping to get a job using one or more of these as I enjoyed them all, but there's still so much I haven't tried so I am keeping my options open.
