After attending Syracuse University for "Advertising Design", I landed as a digital copywriter at BBDO NY. This meant mostly display ads and social media for AT&T and New Balance, as well as product pages for Emirates Airlines. From there I became lead copywriter at Foundry9 (acquired 2014) and worked on roughly 8,000 email and landing page projects for Chase including the Chase Sapphire card launch. 

From there I moved in-house Sony Music's creative services to help a financial service client they picked up as well as music artists including Bruce Springsteeen and Paul Simon. The majority of my time however was spent working on branding, copy, and social media for Walmart's first consumer financial product: Bluebird. 

While working at Sony Music I started a side project called 'Good Erdle' to help make offices suck less by designing and creating ceramic modular planters. My very cool Creative Director gave me time to exhibit at the New York Gift Fair and this lead to press in Design Sponge, The New York Times, and working full-time on product design. After a few more products I opened a Shopify store and learned frontend web design and dev. 

In 2013 I began consulting with The Sill. At the time it was an e-commerce only lifestyle brand that focused on selling curated products. Local delivery was limited to two days a week and gross monthly revenue averaged $3,000. Within 2 months I had developed a line of exclusive products and we began to see 5X YOY growth. In 2014 I helped launch and then led operations and design on The Sill's B2B services with clients including Droga5, Kate Spade, and Twitter. The B2B cashflow allowed my team to then focus on e-commerce and retail with a LES storefront opening in Q4 followed by a site relaunch in Q1 2015. 

Along the way our in-house local delivery expanded to 5 days a week (including same-day and next-day) and I led operations as well as package design in roll out of The Sill's national shipping in Q4 2015. 

In 2016 I led all consumer experiences at The Sill as Partner, VP of Brand - including brand marketing and partnerships, customer service, design, events, retail, PR, product development, and social. This resulted in a 2.5x YOY retail sales growth and a 166% Y0Y increase in Instagram followers. Brand marketing partners included AOL, Away, Harry's, Lively, Opening Ceremony, Outdoor Voices, Refinery29, Pintrill, and S'well. 


And a little background: 

Iâ€™ve had a lifelong obsession with retail after growing up on a family farm and seeing our product on grocery shelves all over the world. My first experience in business was selling blueberries at a wholesale farmer's market at the age of 12. I thought it was really neat that you were allowed to get up at 2AM, go into Buffalo, and eat from a food truck... plus make money. We eventually moved direct-to-consumer and I spent 8+ years working at the Elmwood-Bidwell Farmers Market. I was also fortunate enough to go to one of the highest performing, lowest income per capita public schools in Upstate New York. The head of our art department was a former graphic designer that really knew how to secure funds for new Macs. I've been paying Apple and Adobe ever since.
