### About Slasm

Slasm is a random word, don't look for any meaning behind it. Back in September of 2012 I found a domain name generator that generated a random word based on individual letters. I would link to it now, but it's not working as intended. It still generates strings, but it does not check to see if the domain is available.

I chose to generate random words based on something like C + C + V + C + C, or L + L + V + L + L, or some combination thereof where C = consonant, V = vowel and L = letter.

That’s slasm, no more, no less.

### What To Expect Here

Don’t hope for any particular focus. I will write about anything and everything I can think of, things that happen to me, strange ideas that pop into my brain, my thoughts on things, et cetera.

I do my best to write with impeccable grammar and varied word usage, as if I were writing a novel. So, if you like that sort of thing, this is the blog for you. I am by no means perfect, but I believe that my grammar skills are pretty damn good.
