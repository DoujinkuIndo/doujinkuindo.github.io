I am a graduate fellow working towards PhD degree in biophysics at the Rockefeller University. My research utilizes machine learning approach to do 3D reconstrucion of protein structures from electron microscope images, as well as biochemical experiments to answer the how the structures we have can explain the biological mechanistic working of the protein. In particular I am interested in proteins that works as molecular machinery that controls import/export of molecules in or out of the cells.

### More Information

I completed my undegrad in biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2015. 

Recently, I wrote a simple object-oriented python code to calculate how the change in electoral system in Thailand will influence the outcome of 2019 Thailand general election. additionally I try to analyze what direction Thai politics might undergo in near future as a result of this change. Please check out the [Blog](https://vincentk1991.github.io/)  to read about it.
