We're UCLA's premiere artificial intelligence and machine learning group. We [teach machine learning](https://github.com/uclaacmai/tf-workshop-series-fall17) (along with the latest frameworks such as Tensorflow), [build cool things together](https://github.com/uclaacmai/Machine-Learning-for-March-Madness), and [read research papers and books](https://github.com/uclaacmai/paper-analysis). We also seek to engage with the broader AI community both in LA and beyond.
