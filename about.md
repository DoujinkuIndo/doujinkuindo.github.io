I am a software developer who currently works in biomedical technologies. I have a PhD in physics and an active interest in C++ Programming, Math, and Optics. The blog posts are my personal notes while exploring subjects I am interested in and have much to learn about. It is me explaining to myself as I learn. Hopefully whoever stumbles across the posts finds it helpful to watch me discover new knowledge rather than teach things I already know.
