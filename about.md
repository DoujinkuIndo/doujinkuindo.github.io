I am currently a MRC Doctoral Training Partnership candidate studying at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and Lancaster Medical School. 

Prior to starting my MRC DTP, I worked within the Spatial Ecology and Epidemiology Group (SEEG) at the University of Oxford, led by Professor Simon Hay. 

My DTP research aims to produce high spatial resolution maps of neglected tropical diseases, with a focus on human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). My primary supervisor at LSTM is [Professor Steve Torr](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-stephen-torr), a world expert on the behaviour, ecology and control of disease vectors. My secondary supervisor, based at Lancaster University, is [Dr Michelle Stanton](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/people/stanton.html) whose expertise include spatial statistics, GIS, and satellite imagery processing. More information on my research project can be obtained via my "Research project" page.
