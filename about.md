Software Engineer from the middle of nowhere. Litterally cannot get enough C++ in my life.
Interests include: music, gaming, and tech. For more code related interests see my github page.

Professionally, I am focused on C++ and system witchcraft. Generally, I try to make something do something fast, understand scalability/efficiency, and decipher the mysterious hieroglyphics of any system I'm pointed at. Unforunatetly, but like most of my colleagues, specifics of my professional accomplishments are tied up in NDAs.

Short list of non-professional things I've done:
* built my own keyboard from scratch
* built my own home made smart speaker. (Using `C++` code.)
* created a sudoku solver (mostly as an exercise in actualizing real world performance of various options.)
* ported an audio device driver from one linux kernal version to another
* once was in the top 150 users on Code Fights, now Code Signal (codesignal.com). I remain in the top 250 but the site's competitive programming aspects have faded. :(
* created a log analyzer for online game's extensive logs to provide insights.

Usually I use the newest version of Ubuntu, but some times I use straight up Debian. I daily drive GNU/Linux on all my non-gaming machines.

Thoughts in this blog are my own and do not imply opinions of my employer or communities I am a part of.
