I have been fascinated by data analytics and data science during my four-year Ph.D. study and research. To sharpen my business analytics and model-building skills, I enrolled in Social Data Analytics and Research and Business Analytics, two master's programs at UTD. 

During the study journey in the data world, I feel absorbed in them. I am enchanted by the beauty of data and enjoy the time spent exploring data and finding insights by utilizing multiple tools. All my wonderful experience with data leads me to target myself as a future data scientist. 

I have worked as a research assistant since 2020 summer and accomplished multiple projects with different professors. I am mainly in charge of data collection, cleaning, transformation, feature extraction, statistical regression analysis, time-series model building, etc.  

I also have two months' experience working as a data management intern for a tech company. Besides, I have led and collaborated on multiple group projects, including payroll management system database design via MySQL, using Hadoop and Spark to deal with geospatial big data, and utilizing NLP to do a content analysis of social media posts and news coverage with machine learning models. I also have hands-on experience in multiple industry analytical visualization tools, e.g., Tableau, Microsoft Visio, Shiny, etc. 

To accumulate experience and approach my career goal, I'm actively seeking a summer 2023 Data Science internship opportunity. I look forward to having a chance to work alongside the industryâ€™s brightest engineers, also want to contribute to the evolution of technology as well as participate in mission-critical projects.
