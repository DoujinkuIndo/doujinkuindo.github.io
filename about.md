Hello! I am **Amber McGregor** I am a designer of interfaces, drawer of illustrations and eater of BBQ ribs. I am from Belfast and am currently in my final year of [Interaction Design](http://ixdbelfast.org/), also known as IxD. This blog will be used to record my research and development throughout final year.
