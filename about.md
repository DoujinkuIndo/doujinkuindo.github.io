This is about a my relationship with data. The same way that life brought me to NYC from Barcelona, it had another surprise for me: Data Science. I hope you can enjoy this blog as much as I do and if there is anything you want to say, comment, correct or suggest, do not hesitate to do it.

### More Information

I have a robust training in mathematics, financial mathematics and in all regression and classification models used in Data Science. I like to feed my curiosity as a Data Scientist in evaluating and dissecting problems and delivering practical solutions while unveiling the mysteries hidden in the data. As a team player, I like to bring my passion, loyalty and commitment to my work and to those who worked with me.
