Hey, I go by vel0rum and I'm currently working in the field of defensive network operations (blue team stuff). In the next few years I want to transition into penetration testing (red team stuff). 

I'll be doing a number of qualifications and training courses and basically writing down here everything I learn. I may also upload a video or two to YouTube so I can reference them later/use for revision. 

### More Information

I'm 26 years old and live in the UK.
