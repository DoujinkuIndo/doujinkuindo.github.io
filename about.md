Hi, I'm Alex, I'm a data scientist working at Nauto, a telematics and autonomous driving startup based in Palo Alto.  Before data science, I was a mathematician, a dish washer, a bicycle activist, an account manager, and a lot of other things.  I've been a competitive runner for 22 years, and I love my girlfriend Heidi, my cat Gizmo, and my family!

## Data Science:

I'm just getting started in data science, and as such, I work to improve my technical skills every day.  I have a background in math (UCLA, PhD, 2008), data analysis, and account management, all of which aid me greatly in data science.  My career in data science took off when I attended [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/){:target="_blank"}, and was then hired by Nauto to drive risk assessment of drivers and fleets.

I'm pretty much exclusively a Python coder at this point, though I have had very limited exposure to Scala.  In a typical day, I'm working with the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- SciKit Learn
- Plot.ly

Apart from the technologies I work with, I do quite a bit of end-to-end data science including data collection and labeling, validating algorithms, building production level data science products in the cloud, and developing product scope and requirements in collaboration with other teams.
