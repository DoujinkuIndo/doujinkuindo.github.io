I don't have a lot to say about myself.  Simply a developer who plays with some tech on the side.  The purpose of this 'blog' is mostly just that - playing with some tech.  My initial intention is to use it to keep notes on a FreeNAS setup I am attempting.

I've got this pretty bad habit of _never publishing anything I do outside of work_ and this is a little change from that.
