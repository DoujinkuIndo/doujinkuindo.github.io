### Photography

I carry a camera mostly for helping confirm bird identification but if I can get a nice photograph at the same time, I enjoy it. I upload bird photos to ebird

[Here](https://ebird.org/media/catalog?mediaType=p&sort=rating_rank_desc&userId=USER546658&user=Guy%20Babineau) they are ranked by quality of the photo for identification purposes - which sometimes corresponds to photo quality.
