I am the Director of Ecosystem at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. My mission is to make end users successful and productive with cloud native technologies such as Kubernetes and Prometheus.

In addition to being a prolific public speaker, I founded the Cloud Native London meetup. We are a strong, open, diverse developer community around the cloud native platform and technologies in London. Each monthly event gets 200-300 attendees; [come join us in London on the first Tuesday of each month](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London)!

## Background

Previously I led product management and the DevOps engineering team at StorageOS, a startup building persistent storage for containers. At Google, I was a C++ software engineer building location services and search infrastructure for Google Maps. 

I hold a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, King's College.
