Keeping in touch with memories using the autobiography tools of the future (blogs)!

Writing helps organize your thoughts in a clear way for your own memories as well as to aid others. This blog will help with that along with maybe some random musings longer than 140 characters. 

Cyborg memory is better than the human brain, so this tracks my progress learning and utilizing the best tech I can understand. Hopefully it's helpful to some of you too.
