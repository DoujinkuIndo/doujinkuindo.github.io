I'm a father of 4 great kids, husband to the most amazing woman in the world, and overall geek. I'm a web developer by day, and freelance in the toy and game industry by night.

### About A Pawn's Perspective

A Pawn's Perspective came about because there's things I may want to post that don't necessarily fit with [Purple Pawn](http://purplepawn.com), the tabletop news site I write for. Things include short posts about what I'm playing, longer reviews, pics, and other thing not necessarily in the "news" realm.
