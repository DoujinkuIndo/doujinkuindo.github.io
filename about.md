I am Pragya. I am from India. I am working as a Software Developer at Booking.com. I live in the Netherlands. I enjoy reading non-fictions (mostly about psychology/consciousness). I enjoy cooking. I like to sing Hindustani classical songs, which I learnt for a brief period of two years. I love mountains (not a beach person). Currently, I am trying to pursue my longed interest for writing.
