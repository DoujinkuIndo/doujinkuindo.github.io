### About Me

Hi, my name is **Susanna Dong**!

<div align="center"><img src="/images/me_halloween_2018.jpg" width="400" /></div>

Some random things that I enjoy doing:
* Learning all sorts of things.
* Walking and hiking, especially through nature.
* Games of many sorts - tabletop and video!
* Illustrations and worldbuilding.
* Food, lots of food.
* Housekeeping for my cat.

I'm currently based off of New York City, and grew up in the suburbs of northern Georgia. I've been working as a software/data engineer for a handful of years. (As of May 2021) I'm currently taking a gap year off of work.

### About War(un)lock

#### The Background

A while back, I created a Medium account to write blog posts. The ambition fell through, as:
* I had nothing that I felt like I could talk about.
* Writing blog posts took a non-trivial amount of time to write, and I didn't want to spend more time on the computer than necessary.
* Medium felt like a trend, and something about the minimalism just didn't jive with me.

Fast-forward a few years later. Before leaving my last job in mid-2021, I told folks that I would take a gap year off. Many folks asked if I was going to record my experiences. I caved in and finally set up a blog again!

#### The Metadata

The title "War(un)lock" combines:
* My nerdom of Dungeons & Dragons. (Ironically, warlocks are one of my least favorite D&D classes. Don't @ me.)
* My random love of etymology and making interesting words.
* My strong urge for self-improvement, conveying a message of "unlocking opportunity", or some other motivational buzzword combination.

The goal of the blog is mostly based on experiences from my gap year. This blog's content may range from travel, things I've learned over the past few weeks, my thoughts splattered into text or drawings, and whatever comes to mind.

#### The Tech Stack

I've asked some of my fellow colleagues on what sort of tech stack they've used to power their blogs, which included Netlify and Hugo. I've also considered creating my own static website through cloud object-store buckets, or setting up a Wordpress website. In the end, I settled with GitHub Pages because:
* It saved me from creating another online account, as I already had a personal GitHub account.
* GitHub Pages has free hosting and HTTPS support, while offering flexibility with Markdown content and Jekyll static site generation.
* This blog hosting gave me vibes of the early 2000's, where the internet was still indie and experimental and quirky.
