  ### Some information about me

I am a junior student pursuing bachelors degree in Computer Science with a main focus on Bioinformatics. Besides it, I already complited my minor in Pyhical Sciences. My passion is science overall, I like to define my field of interest as an intersection of sciences. Biomedical sciences create a problem, Computer Science works and solves the problem and Mathematics presents a problem (Mathematics language of Science). My blog will mainly contain information from mentioned fields, Biomedical Sciences, Mathematics, Computer Science and Bioinformatics.
