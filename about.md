Hi, I'm Mike. I am a full-stack software developer with over 13 years of experience creating websites and applications. I have created web based solutions for many nationally recognized non-profits, brands, and government agencies.

I started building websites as a hobby using some pretty bad tools, cough Dreamweaver. From that I eventually went back to school to pursue web design and development as a full time job. I began as a junior front-end developer for an agency in 2009 and have gradually shifted my focus from completely front-end work to back-end development with some light dev-ops.

Currently, I am working on stacks that include some heavily customized Drupal 8 installations. While this is the central focus of my work, I have interests in Javascripts frameworks (including Angular and React.js) as well as Python and PHP.

I believe in helping others by teaching and listening. I think I am better at one than the other. My hope is that my blog will help to give other developers a head start on some of the projects that are similar to mine.

I am [@mawoodcock](https://twitter.com/mawoodcock) on Twitter. Come say hi!
