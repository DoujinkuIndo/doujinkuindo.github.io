### The TL;DR

My name is Leon Zhou.  I went to school for chemical engineering, and I worked in materials and biotechnology.  In 2018, I decided to change direction and pursue a future in data science, where I am now.


  

### The Long of It

I used to be a chemical engineer, with a deeper focus in materials and biotechnology, and that's what I wanted to do.  Through a dangerous combination of personal shortcomings, depression, and anxiety, however, I ended up in a dead-end permatemp job with no way out.  

The SF Bay Area is notoriously expensive, and so with desperate times came desperate measures, and in Feb 2017, I made the decision to move into my [vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Aerostar), a minivan older than I am.  By sacrificing small conveniences and comforts, I hoped to save up, so that I might be in a position to act upon opportunities, should they arise.  That opportunity came in the form of a [data science bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/), where I joined the 10th San Francisco cohort.
