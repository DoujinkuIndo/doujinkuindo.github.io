I'm CTO and co-founder of [Ghost Robotics](https://www.ghostrobotics.io/), which I founded during my Ph.D. with my labmate Gavin.

In the past, I completed a Ph.D. on legged robots at [UPenn's Kodlab](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/), and after that, a postdoc at [Harvard's microrobotics lab](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/).

### ðŸŽ“ Academia

I talk a bit about some of my academic work on this website - see [all the posts on papers](/tags#papers). 

In the posts on this website, I try to communicate some of the content of the papers in simpler intuitive language with the hope that it will help and inspire readers. 

For a more complete list of papers, see [my Google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m-A4ZdEAAAAJ&hl=en).

### âš½ Hobbies

It is pretty tough to keep up with all my hobbies, but I'm doing my best.

Some of my favorite hobbies have been ultimate frisbee with [PADA](http://pada.org/), [fostering kittens](/tags/#cats) and volunteering at [PAWS](http://phillypaws.org/).

I used to have pretty good (musical) keyboard chops (as much as you can without any formal music theory) and still have great [relative pitch](http://www.perfectpitch.com/perfectrelative.htm).

I used to be decent at juggling (basic 3-ball patterns up to Mill's mess, 4-ball cascade on a good day).

I am drawn to [games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) that [require](http://www.popcap.com/bejeweled-blitz) rapid [pattern-matching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)), and enjoy [casual art](/tags/#art).

<!-- ### ðŸ§³ Travels

I have traveled a fair amount in my life (perk of being a graduate student) and I decided to start documenting, because it reminds of the stories involved. Also see [all the posts on travel](/tags#travel).
