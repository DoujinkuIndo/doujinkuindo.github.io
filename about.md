Howdy!

My name is Jeremy Novak. I'm a Software Developer, IT Professional and Apple Enthusiast from Texas. 


My love of computers and games started in the [Golden age of Arcade Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games). 

I am most inspired by what people like [Yuji Naka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuji_Naka) were able to accomplish with such limited hardware. 

When not at the keyboard I enjoy spending time with my dogs, working on my horsemanship,
playing [Disc Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf), and attempt some [outdoor cooking](https://www.youtube.com/user/krollins57/videos). 


Thanks for visiting my GitHub.
