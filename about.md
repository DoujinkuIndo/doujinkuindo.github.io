I studied biological science in undergraduate school and switched to software engineering after discovered excitement from delivering software solution in which greatly improve our daily live. I enjoy breaking down complex problem into smaller piece and solve each of them and put them together to form a big picture.

Besides passionate about coding I enjoy cooking during my spare time particular cook "from scratch".
