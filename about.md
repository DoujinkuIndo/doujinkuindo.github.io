I'm Cheryl Hung, Director of Ecosystem at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io), part of the Linux Foundation. I advocate for and build communities around Kubernetes, cloud native and open source infrastructure.

I founded the [Cloud Native
London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London) for the London community around Kubernetes and cloud native platform. You can meet me there, plus 200-300 techies, on the first Wednesday of every month.
