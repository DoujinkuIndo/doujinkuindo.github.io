I am an AHRC funded doctoral researcher at Cardiff University, studying Ancient Roman History.

### Research Topic

My research more specifically involves the study of representations of Easterners in Roman literature, with particular reference to the gendered nature of these representations. I additionally analyse the influence of military themes within these literary constructions.
