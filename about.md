### More Information

I am currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Racah Institute of Physics, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

I have pursued research on numerical simulations of galaxy formation and worked on projects with Prof. Dr. Cristiano Porciani, Prof. Dr. Avishai Dekel and Prof. Piero Madau.

Some of the highlights of our projects include: the synthesis of simulated data to produce [mock atomic carbon maps](http://www3.uni-bonn.de/Press-releases/new-window-on-the-early-universe) for upcoming ALMA observations and the study of the connection between the [morphology and the evolutionary state of a galaxy](http://bit.ly/1Kb50Fe).

A full list of my publications can be found on [ADS](http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?return_req=no_params&amp;author=Tomassetti,%20Matteo&amp;db_key=AST) or on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Tomassetti_M/0/1/0/all/0/1)

I recently moved to San Francisco to join the Metis group as a data scientist for a 12-week program.
