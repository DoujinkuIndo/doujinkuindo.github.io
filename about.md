My name is Jason. I am from the beautiful green state of Oregon! I am currently working as an IT Technician for a manufacturing company. I've been learning to code off and on for the past few years. I've recently decided to start committing to learning how to code. I first started out with Harvard's CS50, hosted on edx.org. I am currently taking a Udemy course in Web Development. My goal with this blog is to use it to reinforce what I have learned on this journey. Maybe even help someone else.
