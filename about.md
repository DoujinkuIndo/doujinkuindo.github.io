I'm Chris, a web programmer in New York. I studied Comp Sci at SUNY New Paltz and worked for a few years before heading to Flatiron, where I learned more about the web application process. Now I'm searching for a company to bring my skills to! 

My interest with computers was always present, but cursory, until I got to college and discovered a love for Linux. I was so impressed by Linux's ability to get things Just Right the first time, and since then, I've been obsessed with making computers do the heavy lifting for us.
