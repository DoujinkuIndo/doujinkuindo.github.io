I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student working towards a career in software development.  I graduate in May of 2016.

My first taste of programming was in my second semester of college, where I took a non-majors programming class.  We programmed in Scheme, a functional programming language, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  After that class I went and declared a computer science major.  Along the way, I gained an interest in math, and declared that as a major as well.  I'm currently on an adventure to become a software developer, and I'm still trying to find what I enjoy programming most.  Lately it has been web development projects and Android apps.
