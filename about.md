### About me

I studied computer science and law, jurisprudence, and social thought at Amherst College. I now work as an economic consultant in New York. 

I complain a lot about how the internet and law are problematic for one another, but I don't do anything about it yet. 

I enjoy reading books, running and hiking short distances, seeing if I can taste differences between reasonably priced whiskies, and pretending to know more about jazz, men's style, computer science, antitrust law, and many other things than I actually do.

If any of this interests or infuriates you, feel free to contact me at the email below.
