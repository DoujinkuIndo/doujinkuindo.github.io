### Me

I'm Dorian Brown, half Dutch half American, and I've been living in the Netherlands near Amsterdam (*Leiden!*) since 2000. Currently I am working as a data scientist at ING in the Netherlands.

I started this blog as a creative outlet and reason to work on new ideas. For more on this blog you can check out [my first post]({% post_url 2017-10-08-a-short-introduction-and-what-this-blog-is-going-to-be-about %}).

### My Future

Although currently employed, I'm looking out for a new application of machine learning to eventually start my own company. I sometimes feel that with the technologies currently available, our creativity is the largest constraint in finding business opportunities and ways of making life better.

I also love building tangible products, which people can interact with. I love that Spotify's Radio has introduced me to all kinds of music I never would have listened to otherwise, and it's almost entirely machine learning.
