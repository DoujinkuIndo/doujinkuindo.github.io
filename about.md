Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer with 8 years experience in Java, including exposure in Spring (boot, tx, test), REST/SOAP, MyBatis, Git, Scrum, TDD, CI.

I pride myself in developing testable, readable, elegant programs (and tests) in an Agile way collaborating with Global dev teams and customers. Ensuring high test coverage in unit and integration tests has enabled me to develop work having lesser defects.

I'm interested in improving myself on new technologies and methods and in sharing my knowledge via public speaking.
