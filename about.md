I am a machine learning scientist at Microsoft working on optimization algorithms. I am also an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia School of Data Science where I teach graduate level deep learning course.

My research interest are in representation learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I also have keen interest in general machine learning and computational intelligence with applications across multiple domains.
