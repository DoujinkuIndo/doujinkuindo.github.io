Here are some information about myself. If you've known me, you can skip it :). But if you don't, here they are.

My name is Quan Nguyen. I'm currently a fourth year student. I'm interested in software development, machine learning, AI and open source world. I'm in the process of doing my final project and after that I'll be thrown out of my school :((.


### More Information

My school is located in Tan Binh district, Hochiminh city, Vietnam. The school's name is [Hochiminh University of Technology](http://www.hcmut.edu.vn/en), or HCMUT for short. It teaches many falcuties, so it should be called something like "University of Multitechnich". Anyway, I'm currently a student of Computer Science & Engineering falcuty. Yeah, that's all I can think of!

And did I mention I originally from Vietnam? It's a great country with friendly people, great food and crazy traffic. It has many tourist attractions and some of them are world heritages. You should pay a visit to my country and experience its beauty.
