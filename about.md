I'm recently a political science Ph.D. candidate, majoring in international relations, specifically in U.S.-China relations and international organizations research. I'm also enrolled in Social Data Analytics and Research data analysis master program. My research goal is to utilize data analysis skills and quantitative methods to in-depth explore U.S.-China relations and global events. And equipping advanced data science techniques to become a professional data scientist is my career goal.  

### More Information

I program mostly in Python, and I have experience with R, Stata, and SQL. Also, I'm familiar with multiple data visualization tools, such as Tableau, R Shiny, R Markdown Dashboard. I am eager to apply data analysis skills in my future internship. Please feel free to contact me if any research position or internship opportunity is open.

I look forward to your contact and working with you in the future!
