### Brief Bio
I'm Sam Hinton.  I'm a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra where I teach and research digital media, with a focus on front-end web and games.  I'm not the same Sam Hinton who was a gifted musician and marine biologist, but I am pleased to share his name.

I have a book that I wrote with Larissa Hjorth called [Understanding Social Media](https://au.sagepub.com/en-gb/oce/understanding-social-media/book236679).

### Research students
I'm always interested to hear from people who are keen to start a PhD or Masters by research.  I have supervised people doing both traditional (ie: long dissertation format) and creative (major work/exhibition, plus exegesis).  If you think my interests and your intersect and you're looking for a supervisor, then please feel free to drop me an email - sam dot hinton at canberra dot edu and don't forget to add the .au on the end.
