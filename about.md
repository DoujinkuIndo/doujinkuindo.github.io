We built [Maxwell](https://himaxwell.com/) to change the game for small and midsize mortgage lenders — whether you originate $300M or $3B. Today our digital mortgage platform powers hundreds of mortgage lending institutions nationwide, from non-depository mortgage banks, to credit unions, to brokers, to community banks. We work to make them, and their employees, the real heroes who enable homeowners to achieve the American Dream. And we’re just getting started.

Maxwell was founded in 2015 by homebuyers who were shocked by the complexity of the mortgage process for borrowers and lending teams alike. Somehow, in the mix of paperwork, points and process, the humanity and emotion of the largest financing decision of a person’s life had been lost. After spending a year with over 1,000 mortgage professionals, the founding team realized we needed to focus on making the people who make a difference really shine. Now, we employ a world-class team of software experts and mortgage professionals who pull up our socks every morning to do just that. We’re privileged that our company has been recognized by HousingWire, Progress in Lending, MReport, and others as a leading innovator in our industry.  At the end of the day, we are a committed team doing honest work that really matters in the real world — one lender, one borrower, one homeowner at a time. And it works.

### What we believe
