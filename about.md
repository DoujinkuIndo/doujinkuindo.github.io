Alex is an awesome remote full stack developer from Saint-Petersburg, Russia

I started as Rails dev, but now my stack is bigger: I'm familiar with awesome frontend tools like Ember or Angular, but my choose is React.js. My backend skills are also growing: I can develop solid apps in Elixir & Haskell.
