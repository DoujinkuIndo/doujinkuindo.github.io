Hello! I am an economics graduate student currently searching for positions in industry. My current interests are in deep learning, numerical problems, and programming (broadly conceived). However, I am always up for learning about something new. As an economist I worked on problems in macroeconomics and public economics.

Below you will find some links to my papers and projects. Please feel free to reach out to learn more.

## Projects

- **Unnamed Table Reading Project** (Current) Check back soon for details.
- [**Shooting Backwards**](https://github.com/michaelwooley/gertlerKiyotaki2015) Developed novel solution to non-linear, non-stationary banking crisis model by Kiyotaki and Gertler (2015)
     - Time to solution cut 15x
     - Used MATLAB symbolic algebra to demonstrate backwards-in-time solution a quartic polynomial with analytic solution (impossible with pen and paper)
     - Used spline interpolation to infer solution to inner loop.
- [**name.com.bo**](https://youtu.be/IzIUzBddGPo) A search engine for finding and buying a cutesy website name using non-standard domains (e.g. “.com.bo” is the “.com” SLD for the Bolivian country code)
     - Implemented efficient search over 134k words in CMU pronunciation dictionary to find phonetic matches (e.g. “Michael Wooley” &rarr; michaelwoo.ly)

## Resume/CV

One thing that I've found is that many people have widely divergent ideas of what constitutes a good resume or cv. In the hopes of making it easy to find the right information fast, I am posting three versions of my resume/cv:

1. [Business (Longer)](files/wooley_resume_8_9_17.pdf)
2. [Business/"Data Scientist" (Shorter)](files/wooley_resume_short_8_9_17.pdf)
3. [Acadmic CV](files/wooley_cv.pdf)
