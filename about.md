I'm recently a political science Ph.D. candidate, majoring in international relations, specially China-Japan relations, China-U.S. relations, and International Organizations Research, minoring in Political Institutions and American Politics. I'm also enrolled in Social Data Analytics and Research data analysis master program. Deploying programming skills to explore international relations efficiently and accurately is my research goal. 


### More Information

Python is my favorite programming language, and I'm more advanced at it. I also have experience with R, Stata, Javascript, and Java. I am eager to apply the skills I have learned in the future intership. Please feel free to contact me if there is any research position or internship opportunity open.
I look forward to your contact and to working with you in the future!
