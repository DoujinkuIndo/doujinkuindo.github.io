I am a software developer working in Javascript Frameworks(React, Angular JS, jQuery), Python, Node.js and Java. I have developed web-sites and web-apps for e-commerce, banking, edu-tech, and media companies.

### More Information

I actively contribute on Github. Apart from web-development, I am currently pursuing courses in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning on Coursera and Fast.ai. When I am not coding, I enjoy reading, travelling, cooking and shopping.
