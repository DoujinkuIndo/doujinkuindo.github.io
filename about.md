I’m currently a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania.

### More information

My [lab homepage](http://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/Avik/Home) has more information about the work I do. Outside of lab (*...riiight*), I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee with [PADA](http://pada.org/), [fostering tiny kittens](/fosters) and volunteering at [PAWS](http://phillypaws.org/). Please get in touch with me if you want to adopt a kitty friend!

I used to have pretty good (musical) keyboard chops (as much as you can without any formal music theory) and still have great [relative pitch](http://www.perfectpitch.com/perfectrelative.htm); I used to be decent at juggling (basic 3-ball patterns up to Mill's mess, 4-ball cascade on a good day), and am drawn to [games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) that [require](http://www.popcap.com/bejeweled-blitz) rapid [pattern-matching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)).
While I certainly wouldn't call myself an artist, I enjoy drawing caricatures and my design fended off stiff competition from other robot-lab-art-enthusiasts (*ahem*) to make it on the [GRASP t-shirt in 2013](/images/grasp_tee_2013.jpg).

### Travels

I have traveled a fair amount in my life (perk of being a graduate student :wink:) and I decided to start documenting, because it reminds of the stories involved.

### Mini-resume

I'm pretty set on academia, but if you are someone who is looking to hire people and give them a big salary, maybe you want some of this info! (I realize that it's hip to have a Latex resume---but this is honestly way easier to keep up-to-date.)
