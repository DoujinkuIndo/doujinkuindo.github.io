If 40 is the end of a software engineer's life, then I should take the rest of my life very seriously, because I am dying soon and this trip is one way. By the end of my life, I should already earned enough money to keep me alive for the next 60 years.

### More Information

Passionate, responsible and committed engineer, with git-it-done, on-time spirit, and more than 8 years of experience designing, implementing and adapiting technically sophisticated online web applications using Microsoft Technonogies, also I like to learn the web front end technologies, and expert in translating business requirements into technical solutions. That's bullshit, who cares! Believe me, no one will ever read this page. If you do, please send me a message. I will say very big thank you.

Seriously, I am really concerning about the future of our humanity.
