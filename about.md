The NYS Forum Drupal User Group is a sub-group of the [Web and Accessibility Workgroup](https://www.nysforum.org/committees/webmastersguild/) of the [NYS Forum](https://www.nysforum.org). We meet once a month to discuss Drupal. Whether we focus on fixing problems, or learning new skills, we cater to on all levels of experience.

Let us know if you have a problem with a solution, or an FAQ you want to document. We've got a place for that right here: https://github.com/NYS-Forum/drupal-howto/issues
