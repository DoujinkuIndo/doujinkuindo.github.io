Welcome! Iâ€™m Abel. I like to think I'm a data inquirer.

This blog is my collection of amusements and thoughts on statistics and data science.

Exploring the limits of what can be known from available data and
providing means for people to reliably act on it is what motivates me.

I currently work on these issues at [In Loco](www.inloco.com.br).
