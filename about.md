I'm recently a political science Ph.D. candidate, majoring in international relations, specifically U.S.-China relations and international organizations research. I'm also enrolled in Social Data Analytics and Research data analysis master program. My research goal is to equip data analysis skills and utilize them to explore international events. Exploring the data science world in-depth and becoming a professional data scientist are my career goal. 

### More Information

Python is my favorite programming language, and I'm more advanced at it. I also have experience with R, Stata, SQL, and Java. I am eager to apply the skills I have learned in the future intership. Please feel free to contact me if there is any research position or internship opportunity open.
I look forward to your contact and to working with you in the future!
