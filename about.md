Hi, I'm a mathematics Ph.D. who works in Machine Learning. I like to explore interesting problems and the tools to solve them, usually after I've had too much coffee. I also have a Mathematician's habit of writing "we" when I really mean "I", but don't let that fool you. This blog is a place for me to explain and investigate mathematics and how it fits into the broader (scientific?) society via its applications. Enjoy!
