I'm Product and DevOps manager at StorageOS and previously software engineer at Google. I code, write and speak about storage, containers and cloud, and manage a team of DevOps engineers. Iâ€™m active in the developer community and regularly speak at meetups and conferences related to Docker containers, Kubernetes, microservices, cloud native etc.

I founded the [Cloud Native London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London), an official Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) meetup group. It's dedicated to building a strong, open, diverse developer community around the Cloud Native platform and technologies in London.

## Background

From 2010-2015 I worked at Google as a software engineer in London and New York, primarily writing C++ on Google Maps/Local. 

I hold a Masters in Computer Science from King's College, University of Cambridge. My final year dissertation was on [Gesture-controlled robotics using the Vicon motion capture system](https://github.com/oicheryl/cambridge/blob/master/documentation/dissertation/cjh84.pdf).
