Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. This space will have more things in the future.

### More information

My [lab homepage](http://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/Avik/Home) has more information about the work I do. Outside of lab *(...riiight)*, I enjoy staying playing ultimate frisbee with [PADA](http://pada.org/), fostering kittens and volunteering at [PAWS](http://phillypaws.org/).
