My name is Gianluca and I'm a Data Scientist. I recently moved to New York, moving from London where I spent the last 6 years.

If I had to describe myself, I would say I'm quite a sociable person. I like to go out with friends for the occasional brunch or beer after work. I also love coffee, food and ice hockey.

As you might tell, if you had looking around at this blog, I also have a big passion for maths, statistics, and programming. For this reason I've decided to start blogging about it, in order to polish a little bit my writing skills and hopefully make a few new friends while doing it.

When I'm not either working or studying, I go out with friends, binge watch Netflix ― who doesn't!? :-) ― and work out. I love triathlon and have completed a number of Olympic distance races over the years.

I hope you enjoy my articles and invite you to comment if you might have any question or suggestion. After all, science is better done together.
