I'm Matt&hellip; a front-end web developer from Nova Scotia.

I've been writing code in some capacity or another for nearly half of my life, and I take pride in building usable, efficient websites.

Primarily, I develop for [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), but I have enough experience with other content management systems that my knowledge is easily adapted.

### Currently working with

* [Atom](https://atom.io) editor
* Rapid WordPress theming with [Underscores](http://underscores.me/)
* This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
