Hi, I'm Jeff!

### A quick summary of me!
I am a web developer. I grew up in New York City. I am a reformed Wall St. trader and it was my worst job ever. My best job ever to date was when I competed as a professional poker player. I like learning and will keep learning. I enjoy writing down my thoughts.
