Hey there, thanks for reading my blog! Hopefully it didn't waste your precious time. If it helped you even a little bit, it would mean a lot to me! I set up this blog in Dec. 2017 after I decided to start a habit of writing and documenting my works in ML.  

I would greatly appreciate any feedback and open to discussions. Email me if you are looking to collaborate on projects, I'm always open to new opportunities.

### A bit about myself

* I'm a 4th year student at the University of Toronto majoring Computer Science.
* I worked for a year for Amazon as a software engineer. I worked on building an analytical service used in front-end heavy software platform that was deployed in Amazon Fulfillment Centers worldwide.
* I'm interested in deep learning and front end engineering.
* I have a cute 1 yro puppy called Nugget, hence my username, and a 5 yro kitty called Meeko. They are my favorites in the world.
