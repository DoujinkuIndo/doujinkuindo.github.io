I work in the Serverless Developer Relations team at Oracle where I spent most of my timr on [Fn Project](https://github.com/fnproject).
Prior to that, I was working as an Evangelist in the Oracle Java EE organization and was recently involved in the initiative to transition the developemnt of the Java EE platform to the Eclipse Foundation, aka [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/).
I am also a regular speakers at conferences and user groups, large and small, local and global.
