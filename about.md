# Personality
 	* Myers-Briggs Personality Type: INTJ / INFJ
    
**INTJ** (introversion, intuition, thinking, judgment) and [**INFJ** (introversion, intuition, feeling, judgment)](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) are abbreviations used in the publications of the [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)](https://www.cpp.com/products/mbti/index.aspx) to refer to one of the 16 psychological types.

The INTJ represents "The Mastermind," according to the Myters-Briggs test. INTJs are one of the rarest of the 16 psychological types and account for approximately 2-4% of the population.[[1]](https://www.capt.org/mbti-assessment/estimated-frequencies.htm) Women of this personality type are especially rare, forming just 0.8% of the population.
    
  The INFJ personality type is very rare, commonly known as "The Advocate," and makes up less than one percent of the population, but they nonetheless leave their mark on the world. As Diplomats, they have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is the accompanying Judging (J) trait – INFJs are not idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact.
  
  Historical Fun Fact: The MBTI assessment was developed from the work of prominent psychiatrist Carl G. Jung in his book [Psychological Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-691-01813-8). Jung proposed a psychological typology based on the theories of cognitive functions that he developed through his clinical observations.
