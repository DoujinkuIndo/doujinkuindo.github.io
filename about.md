I am the Director of Ecosystem at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. My
mission is to make end users successful and productive with cloud native
technologies such as Kubernetes and Prometheus.

In addition to being a prolific public speaker, I founded the Cloud Native
London meetup. We are a strong, open, diverse developer community around the
cloud native platform and technologies in London. Each monthly event gets
200-300 attendees; [come join us in London on the first Wednesday of each
month](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London)!

## Background

Previously I led product management and the DevOps engineering team at
StorageOS, a startup building persistent storage for containers. At Google, I
built location services and search infrastructure for Google Maps, primarily in
C++.

I hold a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, King's
College.
