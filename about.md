I’m a designer, writer, and coder from Miami, Florida. I’ve worked with all sorts of people to get their message out and make them look good doing it. This site features a few pieces of my work, as well as things to come.

### What I'm doing these days

Since adding HTML and CSS to my journalism toolkit, I've been learning as much as possible about front-end web development. I'm looking for opportunities to work on projects and switch to web development full-time.

### Need a hand? Got some advice? Let me know?

Need some extra hands on a project? Got some advice about my work? I'm all ears. Feel free to reach me at [c.d.villard@gmail.com](mailto:c.d.villard@gmail.com).
