Some information about you!

### Joe Tatusko

I'm an engineer with plenty of experience in the manufacturing of things, from bulk aluminum to satellite communications equipment.

Inefficiency and repetition annoy me, so I spend quite a bit of time writing Python and VBA scripts to take care of the boring parts of work.

Far from a developer, my interests lie in collecting, presenting, and acting on data. You may be surprised at the amount of low hanging fruit just waiting to be exploited at your organization.
