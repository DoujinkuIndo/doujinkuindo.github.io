**_Teaching/Mentoring Philosophy_**  

My teaching and mentoring philosophy is informed by the principles of backward design, scientific inquiry, collective critical reflection, collaborative and evidence informed learning, as well as inclusion of the voices of diversity.    

I focus on knowledge acquisition as a perpetual process, one that takes place both inside and outside the classroom. I take real pleasure in demystifying digital technology in order to foster confidence in our ability for knowledge creation and dissemination. 

As a creative-pedagogy teaching assistant at the University of Toronto, I worked with small groups as we worked on advanced topics in microscopy, microbiology, and cellular and molecular biology.  

In my role as a science judge, I have designed rubrics and judging criteria that eliminate the 'halo effect' and avoid implicit bias and instead inspire future directions and emphasize the representation and demonstration of quality in research work.    


In facilitating data science workshops, I am guided by the digital technology learning tenet that computer science can be harnessed by anyone interested to bring new insights into research using analysis.  As preparation for collaborative projects, I have worked with participants on strategies for developing research questions and hypotheses, exploring the data, reporting the results, and come to conclusions that either support or defy the working hypothesis (the scientific inquiry cycle). Some of the lessons I am currently curating can be found on my STEM education [page](https://noushinn.github.io/STEM_Education/).
