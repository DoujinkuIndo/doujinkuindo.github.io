<p>On spiritual path, our relationship with Guru is the most important relationship. 
However, having <strong>right understanding</strong> and <strong>right attitude</strong> in this relatonship is 
crucial to our advancement. Guru is first a teacher, a mentor and a coach. 
Many a times, we take Guruâ€™s role as that of a saviour from worldly difficulties and 
someone who caters to demands of our whimsical mind and senses. 
This is such a wrong understanding. Since this will defeat the very purpose of spiritual path.</p>

<p>While he is the provider, his
real role is to change us into better souls and prepare us towards spiritual evolution. 
As a mentor to make us better souls he will have to take us through those rough waters. 
There is no other easy path. Our devotion, our surrender and our faith towards our Guru is to understand 
this role and objective of Guru and allow him to transform us from what we are to what we
need to be.</p>

<h6 id="how-you-should-remember-guru">How you should remember Guru</h6>
<p>When you remember Guru, also remember his qualities and then pray to him to pass down
these qualities to you. Guruâ€™s role is to make you what he is. When we think of him as a teacher
and ourselves as obedient student and we have faith in his education (which happens through real life 
events and practices) then we start making progress towards spiritual goal. 
Do not think of Guru as someone who should protect you from all difficulties of practical world. 
Rather pray to him to give you strength to go through these. Accept all difficulties with faith
and surrender and anything that happens to you is happening in guidance and survellance of his 
wish to transform you.</p>
