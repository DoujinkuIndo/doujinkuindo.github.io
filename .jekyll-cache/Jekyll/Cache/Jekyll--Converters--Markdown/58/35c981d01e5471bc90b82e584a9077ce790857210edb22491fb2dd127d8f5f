<p>Here are simple commands to work with git. I will improve upon it as i keep learning.</p>

<h4 id="start-with-basics">Start with Basics</h4>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git chec out -b branch</code> <br />
switches you to a branch</p>

<h3 id="merging-in-github">Merging in GitHub</h3>
<p>Before Creating pull request, you will merge your branch to master. 
After that pull request will be created.
There are few options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a merge commit</li>
  <li>Squash and merge</li>
  <li>Rebase and merge</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="create-a-merge-commit">Create a merge Commit</h5>
<h5 id="squash-and-merge">Squash and merge</h5>
<p>It squashes all commits into a single commit in master. Good if you do not 
want to preserve history of commits in branch.</p>

<h5 id="rebase-and-merge">Rebase and merge</h5>
<p>It resets the header to latest commits before merge (I need to check more on this
) but may be it helps in resolving conflicts.</p>
