<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Access to college/university Email ID</li>
  <li>College Admission Docs/ Valid ID Card</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="procedure">Procedure</h4>

<p>First, you will be needed to add the institute‚Äôs email ID to you github account and verify.</p>

<p>To add the email ID, <a href="https://github.com/email">Click here.</a></p>

<p>You will be greated with similar interface,</p>

<p>Alll you have to do is add a secondary email ID.</p>

<p>However there is a <strong>catch</strong> ; in order to recieve the verification email you will have to change the domain.</p>

<p>You will be having an email address something like this -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>username@tsecedu.org</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Change it to this ‚§µÔ∏è</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>username@tsecol.onmicrosoft.com</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This step is essential to recieve email from Github.</strong></p>

<p><em>This domain may vary based on your university/college and/or education suite provider.</em></p>

<p>Enter the email address with the changed domain and request verification.</p>
