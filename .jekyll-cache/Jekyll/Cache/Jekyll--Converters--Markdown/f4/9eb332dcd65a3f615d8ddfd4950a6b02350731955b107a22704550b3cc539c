I"þ<p>The beauty of single-cell RNA-seq is the ability to delineate the cell
state of each single-cell. This brings a novel advantage when
considering developmental trajectories during organ development or cell
differentiation. The reason for this is that biological processes are
not always in synchrony. In other words, not all cells will exist at the
same stage of differentiation. In that regard, a sample that is
sequenced could contain the entire spectrum of cells between early to
late stages of differention. To quantitate the measure of biological
progress outside of defined time-points, a new metric called
â€˜pseudotimeâ€™ was introduced, which is defined as a distance metric
between the â€˜startingâ€™ cell and â€˜endingâ€™ cell along the trajectory.</p>
