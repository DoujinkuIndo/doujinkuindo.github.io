<p>Everyone is spiritual and has certain aspect of spirituality in them. However, we hesitate in 
taking more concrete and bold steps towards it. There are many fears and unknowns. I like to 
clarify and provide some guide towards it. Questions are welcome.</p>

<h4 id="have-a-clarity-of-your-purpose-write-it-down">Have a clarity of your purpose. Write it down.</h4>
<p>It’s important for you to search within why you want to get started on a spiritual journey. 
There can be many reasons. One of the most common reason/denomenator is that you want to be more 
happy more joyous person. You could also be looking for certain answers. If you take this 
journey sincerely you will most likely find your answers.
Write it down: I want to be more happy. I want to be more content. I want to know who I am.</p>

<h5 id="you-do-not-have-to-stop-doing-anything-to-get-started">You do not have to stop doing anything to get started.</h5>
<p>This is one of the biggest fear. Most people think that if i get started on spiritual journey then
i may have to leave my job or normal life. Spiritual journey does not conflict with your worldly goals. 
While living a very normal life you can pursue this path. In fact, in my honest opinion you are much 
better off pursuing a spiritual journey while conducting your normal duties vs doing it the other way round.</p>

<h5 id="start-with-these-books">Start with these books</h5>
<p>As of now, i will highly recommend 2 books</p>
<ol>
  <li>Autobiography of a Yogi</li>
  <li>Living with Himalayan Yogis 
There are so many saints referred to in Autobiography of a Yogi and if you go and read more about their lives,
it will drive you towards a huge spiritual treasure. I would recommend you read about lives of these saints 
rather than reading lot of theory in the beginning.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="subscribe-to-teachings-of-a-guru">Subscribe to teachings of a Guru</h5>
<p>This is really a very concrete step and most people shy away from taking it. This is due to the complexity involved
in finding a Guru and being ready to submit to their teachings. It is said that there are lesser stars in the sky than
really the number of fake Guru’s in this world. So you will have to be cautious about falling for a fake Guru.</p>

<h5 id="finding-your-guru">Finding your Guru</h5>
<p>I believe in that you do not have to find your Guru. If you become the right disciple, your Guru will find you. 
There are more than needed Guru’s in this world. What is in scarcity is number of right disciples. So in order
to find one you become one.</p>

<p>Do not be in hurry to zero down on a Guru. I would recommend that you read books and their teachings. 
Meditate deep and ask God to send one to you. When you are satisfied you will find the one you need the most. 
Stay away from teachers who are looking to add numbers to their followership and those who are also looking 
for money. Stay away from people who themselves haven’t found God yet. They can be great friends but they
cannot guide you on this path.</p>
