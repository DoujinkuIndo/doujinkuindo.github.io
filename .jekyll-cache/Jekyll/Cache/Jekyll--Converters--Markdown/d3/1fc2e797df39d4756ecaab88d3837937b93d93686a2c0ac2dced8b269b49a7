I"v<p>The Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award or the <a href="https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/f31" target="_blank">F31</a>  is a predoctoral award that provides a stipend and some research allowances for predoctoral students. It is a fellowship provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Preparing an F31 is an ardious tasks that involves many moving components but it can be quite rewarding once completed, and even more rewarding if funded. I prepared an F31 in my second year of graduate school. It was not funded but I learned a lot on how to navigate the grant process, grant writing, and management. On top of all that, there was the research proposal writing itself. I am writing down some tips that can help others prepare their application. These tips can also be applied to other fellowships and grants.</p>
