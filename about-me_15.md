With over a decade of experience working various roles in the IT industry, I have been fortunate to work with various individuals and organizations to implement unique and innovative solutions to technological problems.

My hope for this blog is that I can relay some of the knowledge I obtained in that time and share new things as I learn them. Hopefully, this helps others along the way.

My interests in technology are far and wide. I love infrastructure, systems, communications, networking, security, cloud, coding, operating systems… too much to mention. I think I just love learning new things! With that being said, my focus nowadays seems to be cloud (primarily Azure) and systems.

Outside of work, my hobbies include weightlifting, music (I’ve played the guitar for ~17 years), and hobby-class RC cars.
