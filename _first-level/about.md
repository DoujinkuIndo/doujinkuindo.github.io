### Justin Baum
I am a student at the University of South Carolina studying Computer Science and have decided to drop my math degree for a math minor to pursue industry. I enjoy many fields, including Graph Theory, Elliptic Curve Arithmetic, and Complexity Theory, among other things. I enjoy playing and watching basketball as well.

I currently am the President at [ACM@USC](https://acm.cse.sc.edu), and work as a Software Engineer at NineFX.
