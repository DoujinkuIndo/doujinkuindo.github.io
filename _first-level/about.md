### Justin Baum
I am a student at the University of South Carolina studying Computer Science and have decided to drop my math degree for a math minor to pursue industry. I enjoy many fields, including Graph Theory, Elliptic Curve Arithmetic, and Complexity Theory, as well as many other things. I enjoy playing and watching basketball as well.

I currently work as a Software Engineer at NineFX Inc, where I have been working since August 2018. Previously I had only had experience working on projects solely by myself.

I currently am the President at [ACM@USC](https://acm.cse.sc.edu).

I really enjoy writing Ocaml, Haskell, Python, C++, and Java, in that order, but esoteric projects are not only a major interest for me, but pretty much all I do.
