### Justin Baum
I am a student at the University of South Carolina studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I enjoy many fields, including Graph Theory, Elliptic Curve Arithmetic, and Complexity Theory, as well as many other things. I enjoy playing and watching basketball as well.

I currently work as a Software Engineer Intern at NineFX Inc, where I have been working since August 2018. Previously I had only had experience working on projects solely by myself.

I currently am the Treasurer at [ACM@USC](https://acm.cse.sc.edu).

I enjoy working in mainly Java, and Python, but I also enjoy ReasonML, Erlang, C++, all very much. Esoteric projects are a major interest for me as well.
