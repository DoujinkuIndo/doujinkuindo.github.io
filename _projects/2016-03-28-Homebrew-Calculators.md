This is a quick and dirty project to make homebrew calculators that are just simple, self-encapsulated html and javascript pages that I understand in their entirety.

To use the calculators just click any of the titles below, or clone the [beercalcs repository](https://github.com/shawnnapora/beercalcs) for offline use.

## [Sugar Calc](/beercalcs/sugarcalc.html)
This calculates the amount of priming sugar in ounces (and grains for my scale) based on the weight of the brew.  Just tare the scale with an empty 1 gallon growler/carboy, weigh the full growler, plug the numbers in, and add that much sugar for bottling.  A life saver for one gallon brews where doing the math manually for the different conversions would be time inefficient compared to the brew size.
