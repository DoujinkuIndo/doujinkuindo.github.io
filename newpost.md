I've noticed that on my social media feeds a lot of people are deeply upset that Donald Trump was elected President. Well, technically, he hasn't been elected yet. The [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_%28United_States%29) will [meet on Monday, December 12th, 2016 in their respective state capitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_%28United_States%29#Meetings) to caste their votes, but it's highly unlikely anyone will be a [faithless elector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_elector).

One of the biggest claims is that people [voting third party](http://hendrixjoseph.github.io/vote_third_party/) cost Clinton the election. Is this really true? Let's look at some numbers for four different scenerios, and then I'll say whether it's true or not.

*Note: I got these numbers from [a Google search on November 10, 2016](https://www.google.com/search?q=electorial+college). [You can see my spreadsheet here.](/xlxs/election2016.xlsx

## Case 0: It is as it is

<div class="election-div">
  <div class="clinton-div" style="width: 43%">Clinton: 233</div>
  <div class="trump-div" style="width: 57%">Trump: 305</div>
</div>

## Case 1: Other Votes Never Voted

<div class="election-div">
  <div class="clinton-div" style="width: 43%">Clinton: 233</div>
  <div class="trump-div" style="width: 57%">Trump: 305</div>
</div>

## Case 2: Other Votes Go to Clinton

<div class="election-div">
  <div class="clinton-div" style="width: 60%">Clinton: 325</div>
  <div class="trump-div" style="width: 40%">Trump: 213</div>
</div>

## Case 3: Other Votes Go to Trump

<div class="election-div">
  <div class="clinton-div" style="width: 34%">Clinton: 182</div>
  <div class="trump-div" style="width: 66%">Trump: 356</div>
</div>

## Case 4: Other Votes Are Split Equally

<div class="election-div">
  <div class="clinton-div" style="width: 43%">Clinton: 233</div>
  <div class="trump-div" style="width: 57%">Trump: 305</div>
</div>
