## What is a CanSat?
A CanSat is a capsule the size of a standard soda can. Using a small rocket it is launched to a height of about 1000m and then glides back down on a parachute. The sensors on bord provide various data about the environment, such as temperature, pressure, position and more. This data is either transmitted in real time to a ground station or stored in the capsule and collected after the landing.

More information about the challenge can be found on the official CanSat 2018 competition website
at [cansat.de](https://cansat.de).


## About us
We are the team Apoapsis from Vaterstetten. Our group consists of Niklas Cölle, Leon Hauser, Thomas Schlienz, Henrik Böving and Felix Edelmann, and we all attend the 11th grade of the
Humboldt-Gymnasium Vaterstetten. With our CanSat, we want to measure the fine dust concentration of the atmosphere in higher air layers. The collected data will be added to a public database which will be added to this website.

We were inspired by the project [luftdaten.info](http://luftdaten.info) of the OK Lab Stuttgart, which collects the measurements of public accessible fine dust sensors in real time and displays them on a public available map.
