description: Frequently asked questions for sponsors at Cloud Native London
---

#### How many attendees do you get? What are the demographics?

Cloud Native London is the largest and most active [cloud native meetup globally](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf), with 200-300 attendees each month.

We're working on a demographics survey, but anecdotally:
* 95% men, 5% women
* 90% are technical, as developers, devops engineers, sysadmins, architects, leads etc. The remainder are CIO/CTOs, recruiters, technical sales etc.
* Wide spread of company sizes from startups to large enterprises. Financial services and fintech are particularly well represented.

We can't share attendee email addresses with sponsors to protect their privacy.

#### Can we host an event at our office or run an event on a specific day?

Cloud Native London runs on the first Wednesday of every month. We plan 6-12 months ahead, so unfortunately we can't add extra events to the schedule.

We also use the same venue each month, so aren't looking for venue hosts until further notice.

#### Can we be listed as the pizza / beer / etc sponsor?

As pizza and beer are more than any individual contribution, we order catering ourselves and thank all sponsors equally.

#### Can we bring swag and banner?

You can display a banner inside the room, just bring it on the evening. Please ship swag to this address 1-2 weeks in advance:

> Skills Matter  
> For Cloud Native London c/o Bridey Chase  
> CodeNode  
> 10 South Place  
> London EC2M 7EB  

and email community@skillsmatter.com to let them know you'll need a table on the evening.

#### Can we sponsor as a recruitment agency?

We work with one recruitment agency at a time, so we won't add more until further notice.

#### Can we share our event with your group?

You can post your event to the [discussion board](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London/discussions/).

If you want to have your paid-for event emailed out to the group, we ask for a small donation towards running costs. Email cheryl@cloudnativelon.com for more.

#### What if I have further questions?

Email organisers@cloudnativelon.com or [book a call on Cheryl's calendar](/bookme).
