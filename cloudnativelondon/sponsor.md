You’re interested in sponsoring the ​Cloud Native London meetup​? Awesome! It’s a great way to support the Kubernetes and cloud native community, and increase awareness.

Each event has 200-300 attendees, primarily developers, engineers and technical architects.

Company sizes range from startups to large enterprises, with fintech particularly well represented.

### Benefits ([Download as PDF](/cloudnativelondon/sponsorshippdf))

* A 30 second introduction at the beginning of the event by your representative (or Cheryl or other host.)
* Your logo and company information in emails to group members, blog posts and tweets
* You are welcome to [send a speaker](/cloudnativelondon/speak), but please no direct sales pitches. Due to high demand, the next available speaking slot is mid-2020.
* Sponsors who commit for at least twelve months are listed on [https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London​](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London).

Each sponsor contributes £600 (no VAT) per event.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Can we host an event at our office?

Our events are at the same venue each month, so we aren't looking for venue hosts for now.

#### Can we run an event on a specific day?

We plan events 6-12 months ahead, so unfortunately we can't add extra events to the schedule.

#### Are we listed as the pizza / beer sponsor?

As pizza and beer are more than any individual contribution, we order catering ourselves and thank all sponsors equally.

#### Can we bring swag and a banner?

You can display a banner inside the room, just bring it on the evening. Please ship swag to this address 1-2 weeks in advance:

> Skills Matter  
> For Cloud Native London c/o Bridey Chase  
> CodeNode  
> 10 South Place  
> London EC2M 7EB  

If you need a table on the evening, email community@skillsmatter.com.

#### Can we sponsor as a recruitment agency?

We work with one recruitment agency at a time, so we won't add more until further notice.

#### Can we share our event with your group?

[Promote your events and offers](/cloudnativelondon/share)

#### What if I have further questions?

Contact organisers@cloudnativelon.com.
