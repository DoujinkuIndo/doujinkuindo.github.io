#### Can we host an event at our office?

We aren't currently looking for a new venue, but if you have a venue and can commit to hosting 50-100 people on the first Wednesday of every month, email organisers@cloudnativelon.com to discuss!

#### Can we run an event on a specific day?

We plan events 6-12 months ahead, so unfortunately we can't add extra events to the schedule.

#### Are we listed as the pizza / beer sponsor?

As pizza and beer are more than any individual contribution, we order catering ourselves and thank all sponsors equally.

#### Can we bring swag and a banner?

You can display a banner inside the room, just bring it on the evening. For the address for shipping swag or requesting a table, email organisers@cloudnativelon.com.

#### Can we sponsor as a recruitment agency?

Yes! We work with one recruitment agency at a time and currently are open.

#### Can we share our event with your group?

[Promote your events and offers](/cloudnativelondon/share)
