### Set up monthly sponsorship

Direct debit has much lower transaction fees, so we appreciate you choosing direct debit if you are based in the UK, EU, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada.

<button class="gocardless" onclick="location.href='https://pay.gocardless.com/AL00022PZ8R1ZJ'" type="button">Direct debit</button> {% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
{% include stripe-monthly.html %}
{% else %}
{% include stripe-monthly-test.html %}
{% endif %}
