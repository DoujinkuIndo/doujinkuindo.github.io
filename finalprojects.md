Over the course of the semester in 'A History of Words,' students will learn a variety of digital skills that they will then apply to a final digital project.
Working in groups of two or three, students will identify a source to work with from Princeton University's digital collections, and they will craft a explanatory
narrative about that source using the digital tools they've mastered over the semester. Check back in come May 2021 to see their work linked here!
